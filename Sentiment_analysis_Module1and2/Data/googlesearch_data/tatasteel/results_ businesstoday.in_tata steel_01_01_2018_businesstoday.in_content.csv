2018-07-02,"Tata Steel Ltd will be able to nearly double its capacity in India as a deal between its British entity and Germany's ThyssenKrupp will reduce the Indian parent's debt, the chairman of the company said on Monday. Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp signed a deal on Saturday after months of negotiations to form Europe's second biggest steel company in which Tata and ThyssenKrupp will have a 50:50 partnership. ""Because Europe becomes stronger, it reduces our leverage,"" Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran told a news conference in Brussels that was shown in India via a webcast. ""(The deal) allows Indian operations to grow and address the Indian market,"" he said.Chandrasekaran and ThyssenKrupp Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger jointly addressed the conference. The deal will allow Tata Steel to transfer up to 2.6 billion euros ($3 billion) of debt on its European business to the joint venture company, relieving the Indian parent from substantial interest payments, he said.Chandrasekaran, who is also the chairman of the salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, said Tata Steel aims to increase its capacity in India from 13 million tonnes per annum currently to 25 million tonnes.While he did not give a timeline at the conference in Brussels, he had said in September that Tata Steel would like to double its capacity in India in five years. In the last few months, the third-biggest steelmaker in India has been one of the most aggressive companies in picking up distressed assets after a new bankruptcy code pushed several steel companies into debt resolution in India.The company picked up debt-ridden Bhushan Steel Ltd for 352.33 billion rupees ($5.12 billion) in May and has been short-listed as the highest bidder for unlisted Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. Together, the two acquisitions would help the company to increase its market share in India while also lead to a higher debt, analysts have said.Restructuring in Europe allows the company to focus on opportunities in India, said TV Narendran, chief executive of Tata Steel, said in Brussels. ""It will not be a company that will be sucking cash but will be generating cash,"" Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel told analysts on Saturday.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-chairman-says-deal-to-help-nearly-double-indian-capacity-after-thyssenkrupp-deal/story/279820.html

2018-07-08,"The National Company Law Tribunal today dismissed Cyrus Mistry's pleas challenging his removal as Tata Sons Chairman. The tribunal said that it was not accepting Mistry's contentions that his removal was due to the result of mismanagement by the board and oppression of minority shareholders of the group.The NCLT said that the board of directors was competent to remove executive chairman and Mistry was ousted because Tata Sons' Board and its members had lost confidence in him. The tribunal in its judgement observed that the board and majority of its members lost confidence in Mistry after he sent out certain crucial information about the company to the Income Tax department, leaked details to the media and came out openly in public against the company's shareholders and its board.Tata Sons has welcomed the NCLT's verdict. In a statement issued after the order, Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said: ""The judgement has only re-affirmed and vindicated that Tata Sons and its operating companies have always acted in a fair manner and in the best interest of its stakeholders. The Tata Group has always been committed and will continue to be committed to transparency and good corporate governance of global standards.""""Tata Sons hopes that a finality will be given to the judgement of NCLT, Mumbai by all concerned in the larger interest of companies, the shareholders and the public,"" Mr Chandrasekaran added.The NCLT's judgement was based on a petition filed by Cyrus Mistry challenging his dismissal as chairman of the Tata Sons. The Board of Tata Sons had abruptly removed Mistry as its chairman on October 24, 2016 and sought his ouster from other group companies. He subsequently resigned from the board of six firms, but dragged Tata Sons and his then interim successor Ratan Tata to the NCLT.Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd and Sterling Investments Corp - two Shapoorji Pallonji Group entities - in the petition against trustees of Tata Trusts and directors of Tata Sons had alleged abuse of articles of association by outsiders, breakdown of governance and loss of ethical value.The petition claimed that Mistry's removal as chairman and subsequently as director of the board of Tata Sons was a result of oppression by promoters who are in-turn owned by Tata Trusts that owns over 68 per cent in Tata Sons. The second part of the petition focused on the alleged mismanagement by Tata Sons board and Ratan Tata which caused massive revenue loss for the group.However, Tata Group had denied all the charges and said that Mistry was removed because the board had lost confidence in him. It further said that Mistry intentionally and in bad faith leaked sensitive and confidential information causing loss in Tata Group's market value. ""He (Mistry) was appointed at the behest of Tata Trusts and his removal cannot be questioned by minority shareholders,"" the Group's counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi had argued before the tribunal.The Tata Group argued that the law clearly allows removal of a chairperson and director and Mistry was removed by a majority of 7 out of 9 -  Mistry had not voted for his removal and another official had abstained.NCLT Mumbai's special bench of B S V Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy was expected to deliver its order in the case on July 4 but adjourned it to July 9 as the judgement was not ready.Ahead of the NCLT verdict, Cyrus Mistry last week questioned the rationale behind Tata Group's some of the business transactions done lately. He questioned the sale of group's telecom arm to Airtel, massive debt-driven acquisitions by Tata Steel and its unequal tie-up with Thyssenkrupp, and a first-ever dip in TCS profit.Questioning the ""free transfer of Tata Teleservices"" to Airtel, the letter said the Tatas did not get any benefit from the deal despite transferring 40 million customers, a large swathe of liberalised spectrum and access to Tata Teles extensive fibre network, while it has immensely benefited the acquirer. Mistry said that he failed to understand the logic of offering Bharti Airtel access to these assets effectively for free.Comparing the massive debt-driven expansion of Tata Steel to its doomed acquisition of Corus, Mistry cautioned against a potential debt burden arising from the Rs 80,000-crore capex needed for acquiring Bhushan Steel (Rs 35,000 crore), Bhushan Power & Steel (Rs 24,000 crore through the NCLT) as well as the Rs 23,000-crore expansion of Kalinganagar project. ""If the commodity cycle and the uptick in steel prices are to change again, leading to a decline in prices, Tata Steel will once again stand highly exposed with serious consequences Tata Sons,"" he warned.In a letter to the directors of Tata Sons, Cyrus Investments Mistry has sought accountability and information from the board of Tata Sons. Mistry family owns 18.34 per cent in Tata Sons - which makes them the single largest individual shareholder in the holding company of the Tata Group.Stating that the board is accountable for governance and performance of the Tata Group as also to the minority shareholders, the letter states that despite staring at several burning issues, ""Tata Sons is hiding behind the veneer of media management to present a rosy picture.""(With input from PTI)",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/nclt-verdict-ratan-tata-cyrus-mistry-tata-sons/story/280028.html
2018-06-30,"The Tata Steel board gave the green flag to the joint venture with German steel giant Thyssenkrup today. Back in Germany, the Thyssenkrup supervisory board also approved the collaboration with the Indian steel manufacturer. This deal will see both steel majors combine their European businesses to form a 50:50 joint venture.The resultant entity, which will be called Thyssenkrup Tata Steel BV , will be the second-largest steelmaker in European steel sector after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal. It will have around 48,000 workers and about 15 billion euros in sales. The definitive agreement signed today will be formally executed shortly, Tata Steel said in a BSE filing.Meanwhile, Thyssenkrup said in a statement that joining forces with Tata Group will help with its transformation into an industrial and service group, and will help to improve its financial standing.Both parties expect the deal to be completed within 12-18 months from the date of execution of the transaction documents, the statement said, given that they get the required regulatory approval in time.Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) back in September 2017 to this effect after announcing plans to combine their European businesses and form a joint venture. Now that they are together, the steelmaking joint venture aims to produce 35,000 million tonnes of cold rolled grain oriented steel every year from its expanded factory, instead of the earlier capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum. The company had said the new product line set-up will help in meeting the continuously increasing demand for cold rolled grain oriented in the Indian market.According to a Reuters report, the German steelmaker is expecting annual synergies of 400 million to 500 million euros from the transaction, having previously communicated a maximum of 600 million. Tata Steel's Dutch facility will be part of the cash pooling mechanism of the JV, which had been a key demand for German workers concerned that Tata would give its own workers better conditions in the new company.In case of an initial public offering (IPO) of the joint venture, which is widely expected by investors and has been flagged by both companies, Thyssenkrup would get a bigger share of the proceeds ""reflecting an economic ratio of 55-45,"" the report further said.The Tata Steel-Thyssenkrup deal comes in the backdrop of heavy tariffs of 25 per cent imposed by the Trump administration on steel imports from both European Union and India.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-thyssenkrup-joint-venture-approved-second-largest-in-european-steel-market/story/279753.html
2018-02-19,"Tata Steel has just pulled off its largest acquisition to date. Pipping JSW Steel - contrary to all speculation - it has reportedly emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel. The latter, to remind you, was on RBI's first list of 12 companies to be referred to the National Company Tribunal Law (NCLT) and according to the latest Economic Survey, claims admitted under the insolvency proceedings stand at a whopping Rs 55,989 crore, making it the biggest bankruptcy, so far, to go under the hammer. What a coup pulled off by N. Chandrasekaran, the first non-Parsi chairman of the Tata Group in its 150-year-old history, as he begins the countdown to his first anniversary in office.According to MoneyControl, Tata Steel's surprise bid of Rs 35,000 crore was Rs 5,300 crore more than rival JSW Steel's offer. The aggressive bidding makes sense since Bhushan Steel's annual capacity is 5.6 million tonne - according to its website. It is the third largest secondary steel producer in the country and its acquisition will help Tata Steel tighten its grip on the eastern region. According to advisory firm Bonaz Capital, this acquisition would help it to increase domestic steel capacity by around 43 per cent to 18.6 million tonnes per annum. ""We expect the company to report revenue CAGR of 5.3 per cent over FY17-20E [expected] aided by 6.1 per cent volume growth in domestic steel production...EBITDA margins are also likely to expand by [around] 573 bps owing to better utilization for Tata Steel India,"" it added.But given that the crippled Bhushan Steel Ltd reported widening of its net loss to Rs 1,607 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, a jump of 116 per cent year-on-year, not everyone is excited by the prospects. Shares of Tata Steel are down 7 per cent since morning. But the share price of Bhushan Steel has jumped up a whopping 20 per cent, the most in three months.  Incidentally, Tata Steel is also the leading bidder for Bhushan Power and Steel. According to The Economic Times, lenders to the company decided that they would only consider Tata Steel's offer of Rs 24,500 crore - which includes an upfront payment of Rs 17,000 crore to lenders, a cash infusion of Rs 7,000 crore to meet the company's working capital requirements and a payout to operational creditors-for further negotiations on Wednesday, setting aside JSW Steel's offer that is lower by Rs 11,500 crore. Sources also told the daily that if Tata Steel does manage to pull off both acquisitions, it might gain half the market share for flat-steel products in the country.

2018-03-07,"One of the country's biggest bankruptcies to go under the hammer is finally moving towards closure. Yesterday, Tata Steel said that ""it has received a formal communication from the resolution professional [RP] of Bhushan Steel Ltd that it has been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire controlling stake"" of the beleaguered company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. The company statement added that the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Bhushan Steel had taken the decision at a meeting on March 6, and the next steps will be as per the stipulations under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. The advisors to the CoC and the RP are currently in discussions with Tata Steel on the resolution plan.Although Tata Steel did not disclose the financial details of the acquisition bid, two people close to the bidding process told Mint that the company has offered close to Rs 34,800 crore as upfront payment to banks and an additional Rs 1,200 crore to the operational creditors. In addition, Tata Steel has also offered 12% equity stake to lenders in Bhushan Steel, who were owed Rs 44,478 crore. The rival bidder for this asset, JSW Steel, had reportedly offered around Rs 29,000 crore. Reacting to the news, Bhushan Steel's share price had spiked 12 percent since closing price yesterday, but is now headed downward again.Bhushan Steel was on the RBI's first list of 12 companies to be referred to the National Company Tribunal Law (NCLT). With an annual capacity of 5.6 million tonnes, its website claims that it is the third largest secondary steel producer in the country. This explains why the auction had seen such aggressive bidding - well over the liquidation value reportedly pegged at Rs 20,000 crore.If the deal goes through, this asset will not only help Tata Steel tighten its grip on the country's eastern region but perhaps also help it to snatch the title of 'India's largest steel maker' from JSW Steel. According to advisory firm Bonaz Capital, the acquisition would help it to increase domestic steel capacity by around 43 percent to 18.6 million tonnes per annum. ""We expect the company to report revenue CAGR of 5.3 percent over FY17-20E [expected] aided by 6.1 percent volume growth in domestic steel production...EBITDA margins are also likely to expand by [around] 573 bps owing to better utilization for Tata Steel India,"" it added.This announcement will also bring much relief to fraud-ravaged Punjab National Bank, as it was the term loan consortium leader for Bhushan Steel. In fact, PNB reportedly had an exposure of close to Rs 5,000 crore, much of which will now come back to coffers and help it to partly offset the damage allegedly wrought by Nirav Modi over the past seven years.Meanwhile, Tata Steel has also submitted a bid for Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. According to media reports, if it manages to pull off this double coup, Tata Steel will grab half the market share for flat-steel products in the country.With PTI inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-bhushan-highest-bidder-power-insolvency-irp/story/272185.html

2018-02-12,"The deadline for submitting bids for the beleaguered Essar Steel, put up for sale under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), ends today and it's reportedly looking like a tug of war between the Ruias and L.N. Mittal, though Tata Steel is also expected to enter the fray.Yes, the government has amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to prevent promoters of defaulting companies to bid for stressed assets. Yes, Essar Steel, with over Rs 43,000 crore of debt on its books, was among the initial 12 companies identified by the RBI for insolvency proceedings and was controlled by siblings Shashi and Ravi Ruia. And yes, ArcelorMittal was a shareholder in Uttam Galva, which was taken to the National Company Law Tribunal in April last year after defaulting on Rs 110 crore loans. But the parties involved seem to have found neat solutions to stay eligible to bid.Last week, according to The Economic Times, L.N. Mittal-led ArcelorMittal cashed out of its investment in Uttam Galva-at a loss-to avoid any last-minute controversy and has joined hands with Japanese giant Nippon for the bid. The Ruia family got a lot more creative and has pinned its hopes on a special purpose vehicle, Numetal Mauritius, in which leading Russian bank VTB is the largest shareholder followed by Russia's Tyazprom Export, a construction engineering and management consulting company that specialises in steelworks. Rewant Ruia, son of Essar cofounder Ravi Ruia, is the minority partner, the shareholding held via a Singapore-based trust. Sources close to Essar told the business daily that since the Ruias are a minority partner, the Numetal bid will not be in violation of the IBC's related party clauses.Tata Steel, the other potential contender, is widely expected to be less aggressive than these two, while Vedanta and JSW are unlikely to submit binding offers. Satish Kumar Gupta of Alvarez and Marsal (A&M) is the resolution professional (RP) appointed to oversee Essar Steel.Though the liquidation value has reportedly been fixed at Rs 20,000 crore, the Numetal bid is expected to be in the range of Rs 35,000-40,000 crore. But that's no shoo-in since the world's largest steelmaker, ArcelorMittal, is widely expected to be as aggressive. Mittal has wanted to build a steel plant in the country since 2005 but has been repeatedly thwarted by regulatory hassles. Essar's 10 million tonne steel plant in Hazira, Gujarat-India's largest single-location flat steel plant-will fit neatly into the company's plan to create a sizable footprint in the Rs 3.15 lakh crore Indian steel market. The Ruias, meanwhile, will not want to let go of their hold at a time when steel prices have shot up 15% in the past seven to eight months. Moreover, according to the World Steel Association, steel production in India is projected to grow at 7.1% in 2018, the highest rate among the top 10 steel-using countries.One hopes that the bidding war does not see the IBC amendment get creatively thwarted, because that will only open the floodgates for other defaulting promoters to get back in on the action.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/essar-steel-bidding-ruia-family-numetal-arcelormittal-insolvency-promoters/story/270482.html
2018-07-05,"The CEO of German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp on Thursday announced his resignation, just days after he hailed the ""historic"" merger of the company's steel-making business with Tata Steel.In a move that came as a surprise, the company announced that Heinrich Hiesinger has asked the Supervisory Board of the company to end his mandate as Chief Executive Officer of Thyssenkrupp AG ""in mutual agreement"".Hiesinger said: ""Today I informed the Supervisory Board that I would like to step down from my position as CEO of Thyssenkrupp. I take this step very consciously to enable a fundamental discussion in the Supervisory Board on the future of Thyssenkrupp.A joint understanding of Board and Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company, he said.He added: ""The joint venture of our steel activities with Tata is the next significant step to turn Thyssenkrupp into a strong industrial company. We can be proud of what we achieved until now.For this I would like to thank all employees.

The new steel company will have a total workforce of 48,000 employees spread across 34 sites.Prof Ulrich Lehner, chairman of the supervisory board, praised the outgoing CEO and said that the Board, under the leadership of Hiesinger, has freed Thyssenkrupp from an existential crisis and made the company ready for the future by implementing the strategy which was agreed by the Supervisory Board.Without Heinrich Hiesinger there would be no Thyssenkrupp today. I am deeply grateful for what he achieved and especially for how he achieved this: intelligent, modest, consistent; with far-sightedness and social responsibility and always in the interest of our customers, employees and shareholders, he said.The Supervisory Board will meet tomorrow to discuss and decide on the request of Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp said.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/thyssenkrupp-ceo-steps-down-days-after-tata-steel-merger/story/279966.html
2018-10-10,"No-frills carrier AirAsia India, which has been facing headwinds in the country for quite a few years now, may finally be getting a new chief. Sources in the know told The Economic Times that Sunil Bhaskaran, currently the vice-president of corporate services at Tata Steel, was hand-picked as the new head of AirAsia India by Tata Sons' chairman N. Chandrasekaran, and a formal announcement is expected this week, perhaps even today.The chief's office had been lying vacant since Amar Abrol resigned from the position in May citing personal reasons, and reportedly moved back to the airline's headquarters in Malaysia to work on other projects. JetBlue executive Eash Sundaram was subsequently offered the role, but he declined.""Sunil has been working closely with the government and that would come handy in a regulated sector like aviation that is facing tremendous headwinds at the moment. He would have his hands full,"" an old associate told the daily. Bhaskaran, currently based in Jamshedpur, is also the chairman of the board at Jusco and Jamshedpur Football Club. AirAsia India is a joint venture between Tata Sons Ltd and Malaysia's AirAsia Berhad. Since its inception, the four-year-old airline had been run by CEOs chosen by the management of AirAsia Berhad, including its Group CEO Tony Fernandes, who was booked by the CBI in May for allegedly bribing government officials to secure the international flying license back when the 5/20 rule was in place. The rule, which came into effect in 2004, mandated airlines to have five years of experience as well as a minimum 20 aircraft-fleet to be eligible to fly on international routes. In 2016, this rule was partially eased to allow domestic airlines to fly overseas provided they deploy 20 planes or 20% of their total capacity for domestic operations, which benefited AirAsia India and Vistara, both partly owned by the Tata Group. The CBI alleged that payments to the tune of Rs 12.28 crore were remitted to India to lobby with public servants to tweak government policies during the UPA rule.The airline was already being probed on the basis of the claims made by ousted Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry. The latter had alleged that fraudulent transactions of Rs 22 crore, involving non-existent entities in India and Singapore, were carried out in AirAsia India. Moreover, two years ago, a Deloitte Touche investigation had unearthed irregularities in the financial transactions of about Rs 22 crore involving the airline's former CEO Mittu Chandilya. The buzz about Bhaskaran's appointment comes even as whispers of a wider leadership reshuffle in AirAsia India are getting louder. Citing sources the daily added that there is a possibility that the airline's chairman, S. Ramadorai, may also step down soon.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-vp-sunil-bhaskaran-to-be-new-air-asia-india-boss-report/story/284571.html
2018-10-17,"In the first quarter of this financial year, Tata Steel took a debt of around Rs 17,500 crore for acquiring 5.6 million tonne (MT) Bhushan Steel and, with this, its consolidated debt increased to Rs 1,16,615 crore from Rs 92,147 crore three months before. Tatas acquired Bhushan offering Rs 35,200 crore to the lenders and Rs 1,200 crore to the operational lenders. Besides, the company agreed to acquire the steel business of Usha Martin for Rs 4,700 crore in September. The latest news is that Tata Steel plans to match the offer price of JSW Steel for Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL). It is likely to revise its bid to Rs 19,700 crore from its earlier Rs 17,000 crore. Tata Steel's steel production capacity in India will increase to 19.3 MT with the acquisitions of Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin. BPSL has 3.5 MT of capacity. In addition, Tatas looks to add in 5 MT greenfield expansions. Adding up all these, the capacity of the company will go up to 27.8MT, but at a cost of additional Rs 45,000 crore. Tata Steel had a consolidated revenue of Rs 1.33 lakh crore and a profit of Rs 17,757 crore in the last financial year. JSW Steel along with Aion Capital acquired the 1.5-million-tonne Monnet Ispat and Energy at Rs 3,875 crore, including Rs 1,000 crore as equity and working capital. The steel maker will have 19.5 MT capacity with the addition of Monnet. In addition, the company looks to build 6MT Greenfield capacity. The company's gross debt stood at Rs 39,600 crore at the end of the June quarter. If JSW wins BPSL and adds 6MT Greenfield capacity, the production can be increased to 29MT. But that itself will be a cost burden of Rs 50,000 crore. JSW Steel had a consolidated revenue of Rs 71,670 crore and a profit of Rs 6,113 crore in the last financial year. In the last two financial years, the steel sector has witnessed a turnaround with the country's steel production going up from 89 MT in FY15 to 134 MT in FY18. The exports went up by 136 per cent and India became a net exporter of steel for the first time in FY18. India's per capita steel consumption has jumped from 58 kg to 68 kg in the past three years. The government has set an ambitious target of 300 MT of crude steel production by FY31 in its National Steel Policy. The per capita steel consumption is estimated to jump to 158 kg by then. The state-run Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is the largest steel maker in capacity with 21 MT, including the Bhilai expansion. It has completed the expansion programme at its plants at Rourkela, Bokaro, Asansol and Durgapur. Commissioning of a melting shop with billet casters at Bhilai in Chhattisgarh has marked the end of its current capital expenditure cycle. The company has a debt of Rs 45,000 crore. Vedanta group is also looking to pursue its ambitions in steel business and it acquired Electrosteel Steels at Rs 5,320 crore through the insolvency process.

The UK-based Indian-born founder of the metals and industrial group told CNBC TV 18 that the company has requested NCLT to consider its bid, saying their offer is 'definitely superior' to Tata Steel's bid.Earlier, there were reports that Tata Steel's offer of Rs 24,500 crore - which includes an upfront payment of Rs 17,000 crore to lenders, a cash infusion of Rs 7,000 crore to meet the company's working capital requirements was the leading offer.""India is a natural home for us, promoters of our group are Indian.

2018-03-22,"US President Donald Trump lit a slow-burning fuse on Thursday to launch long-promised anti-China tariffs, but his actions appeared to be more of a warning shot than the start of a full-blown trade war with Beijing. A presidential memorandum signed by Trump will target up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs over what his administration says is misappropriation of US intellectual property, but only after a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list is published.Trump gave the Treasury Department 60 days to develop investment restrictions aimed at preventing Chinese-controlled companies and funds from acquiring US firms with sensitive technologies. The waiting periods will give industry lobbyists and US lawmakers a chance to water down a proposed target list that runs to 1,300 products, many in technology sectors. It also will create space for potential negotiations for Beijing to address Trump's allegations on intellectual property and delay the start of immediate retaliation against U.S. products from aircraft to soybeans. ""I view them as a friend"" Trump said of the Chinese as he started his announcement. ""We have spoken to China and we are in the middle of negotiations.""'FIGHT TO THE END'But his actions provoked a belligerent response from China's embassy in Washington, which vowed Beijing would ""fight to the end"" in any trade war with the United States. ""We will retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer,"" Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted to the embassy's Facebook page.Stocks fell sharply on Trump's announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI falling nearly 3 percent. Major industrials that could become targets of Chinese trade retaliation slumped further, with aircraft maker Boeing down 5.2 percent and earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar falling 5.7 percent.In addition to punitive tariffs, Trump's memo also directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to challenge China's technology licensing programs at the World Trade Organization. The WTO has repeatedly drawn the ire of the administration but it could provide a resolution that avoids a trade war.The steps are based on the results of USTR's eight-month investigation of suspected misappropriation of American technology by China.US officials say that probe, undertaken through Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, has found that China engages in unfair trade practices by forcing American investors to turn over key technologies to Chinese firms.Trump, who earlier this month announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, also wants the Chinese to take action that would lower the $375 billion goods trade deficit that the United States is running with China. White House officials told a briefing ahead of the trade announcement that the administration was eyeing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. They said the figure was based on a calculation of the impact on the profits of U.S. companies that had been forced to hand over intellectual property as the price of doing business in China.There was no explanation of the difference between that figure and Trump's $60 billion. ""Many of these areas are those where China has sought to acquire advantage through the unfair acquisition and forced technology transfer from US companies,"" said Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the National Economic Council.In addition, Trump will also direct the US Treasury to propose measures that could restrict Chinese investments in the United States, Eissenstat said. China has threatened to target US exports of agricultural commodities, in particular the $14 billion in exports of soybeans.Reaction from US industry groups sought to strike a balance, applauding the president for tackling the persistent drain of US technology to Chinese competitors, but urging negotiations instead of tariffs.""American business wants to see solutions to these problems, not just sanctions such as unilateral tariffs that may do more harm than good,"" said John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council.Despite threats of retaliation, China has been keen to portray itself as a defender of globalization, a message that was reinforced in a call between President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron.That said, there is a risk of a mounting cycle of retaliation. US Trade Representative Lighthizer warned on Wednesday that Washington would take ""counter measures"" if Beijing targeted US agriculture.The biggest risk to world trade over the longer term may not be a tit-for-tat trade war, but the breakdown of global supply chains that feed companies such as US auto giant General Motors Co and Apple Inc. ""Tensions are likely to escalate further, even without a full-scale trade war. This could disrupt global supply chains and damage investor sentiment,"" said Dario Perkins, head of global macroeconomics research at TS Lombard, a London-based economic consultancy.Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, which are tied to Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, go into effect on Friday. Canada and Mexico have been given initial exemptions from the 25 percent steel and 10 percent aluminum tariffs.Lighthizer told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that the European Union, along with Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea, would also be exempted.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/us-china-donald-trump-tariff-chinese-imports-60-billion-beijing/story/273205.html
2018-08-10,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) today upheld the sale of Bhushan Steel to Tata Steel, rejecting allegations of its ineligibility by the promoters of the debt-ridden firm.The appellate tribunal also rejected the claims of engineering and construction major L&T, an operational creditor of Bhushan Steel Ltd, opposing Tata Steel's resolution plan seeking a higher priority in debt resettlement.An NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya rejected the claims of its promoters Neeraj Singal that Tata Steel was ineligible to bid for Bhushan Steel under section 29 A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).The appellate tribunal said that Tata Steel UK, a foreign subsidiary of Tata Steel, which was fined by an English Court in February 2018 under UK Act, had a provision of imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or a fine, or both.While, the provision in section 29A (d) of IBC, which deals with eligibility, stipulates has been convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more, cannot be equated with Section 33(1)(a) of the U.K Act, said NCLAT.We hold that Tata Steel UK, which is the connected person of Tata Steel Ltd, does not attract the disability. under Section 29A of the I&B Code and for the said reason, we also hold that Tata Steel Limited is eligible to file the Resolution Plan, said NCLAT.Section 29 A of the IBC mandates that a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more is ineligible for submitting a resolution plan.Over the claims of L&T, which had supplied goods and machineries goods over Rs 900 crore, NCLAT said that Tata Steels resolution plan was fair towards operational creditors of Bhushan Steel which has a total demand of Rs 1,422 crore.The appellate tribunal observed that the company has allotted Rs 1,200 crore for them and L&T plea for a higher priority could not be accepted.We hold that the Resolution Plan submitted by Tata Steel is fair and equitable to all the, Creditors including the Operational Creditors therefore, no interference is called for, the appellate tribunal said.Moreover, it also declined the plea of Brij Bhushan Singal of the promoters family, contending Tata Steels Resolution Plan was illegal as it purports to transfer shares of the preference shareholders of Bhushan Steel without their consent for a fixed consideration of Rs 100 as against Rs 2,269 crore.Over the claims of Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Jharkhand that part of the land shown in the resolution plan does not belong to Bhushan Steel and is in illegal possession of the company, NCLAT said that Tata Steel is aware of the proceedings.If the title of land is defective, it cannot be cured upon taking over the assets of the Corporate Debtor (Bhushan Steel) by the Resolution Applicants, said NCLAT.It further said: ""The Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for the said reason held that remedy available to the Applicant/State of Jharkhand and its Officers, having already initiated and pending against the Corporate Debtor, allowing or rejecting the Resolution Plan will not affect the legal remedy.Bhushan Steel owed its lenders about Rs 56,000 crore and was among the 12 big loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India last year to undergo insolvency under the new bankruptcy law.On May 15 the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel and this was challenged by Neeraj Singal and L&T before NCLAT.Tata Steel has offered Rs 35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel.It would pay another Rs 1,200 crore over next 12 months to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.We are not inclined to interfere with the order dated 15th May, 2018, passed by the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) in the case of Bhushan Steel Limited under challenge in Company Appeals...

2018-07-03,"The Mumbai bench of NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) on Wednesday deferred its judgement on ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry's petitions against the Tata Group. The NCLT order in the Tata-Mistry case will now be pronounced on July 9 at 10:30 am.Ahead of the verdict, Mistry had filed fresh salvo at Tata Sons management. The former chairman questioned the rationale behind some actions like the free sale of its telecom arm to Airtel, massive debt-driven acquisitions by Tata Steel and its unequal tie-up with Thyssenkrupp, and a first-ever dip in TCS profit among others.In a letter to the directors of Tata Sons, Cyrus Investments, which is the key investment vehicle of the Mistry family and the key petitioner in his legal feud with the Tatas, Mistry has sought accountability and information from the board of Tata Sons in which his family owns 18.34 per cent.The NCLT was earlier expected to deliver its verdict today on the bitter legal feud that Mistry has been fighting ever since dismissal as the chairman of the Tats Sons on October 24, 2016.The key allegation by Mistry camp is that his removal as chairman and subsequently as a director of the board Tata Sons was a result of oppression by the promoters who are in turn owned by Tata Trusts that owns over 68 per cent in Tata Sons.Stating that the board is accountable for governance and performance of the Tata Group as also to the minority shareholders, the letter states that despite staring at several burning issues, ""Tata Sons is hiding behind the veneer of media management to present a rosy picture.""Questioning the ""free transfer of Tata Teleservices"" to Airtel, the letter says the Tatas did not get any benefit from the deal despite transferring 40 million customers, a large swathe of liberalised spectrum and access to Tata Teles extensive fibre network, while it has immensely benefited the acquirer.Terming the deal, which led to an increase in market capitalisation of Airtel by almost Rs 30,000 crore, as a ""sweetheart deal,"" Mistry says, ""he fails to understand the logic of offering Bharti Airtel access to these assets effectively for free.""It can be noted that Tata Tele has been on the downslide for years and is sitting over Rs 26,000 crore of debt which has to be cleared before the sale goes through.Mistry also asked why a successful exit from the enterprise business has not been pursued, ""despite receiving a USD 1-billion offer from a former senior Tata employee backed by a private equity firm.""The letter also asks the directors to satisfy themselves that transactions that Tata Motors has entered into with Jayem Auto and Ola are at 'arm's length' and 'value accretive', given that these companies have investments from Ratan Tata.He also expressed concerns on the continuing poor performance of its marque British brand JLR, whose volume ""rose a mere 1.7 per cent"" in FY18.Comparing the massive debt-driven expansion of Tata Steel to its doomed acquisition of Corus, which later nearly sunk the parent company, he cautioned against a potential debt burden arising from the Rs 80,000-crore capex needed for acquiring Bhushan Steel (Rs 35,000 crore), Bhushan Power & Steel (Rs 24,000 crore through the NCLT) as well as the Rs 23,000-crore expansion of Kalinganagar project.""If the commodity cycle and the uptick in steel prices are to change again, leading to a decline in prices, Tata Steel will once again stand highly exposed with serious consequences Tata Sons,"" warns the letter.He also held the management accountable for the deteriorating performance of Tata Steel Europe that compromised the deal with Thyssenkrupp, which was initially meant to be an equal JV but finally sealed as 45:55 JV.He has also vented his concerns over the deteriorating profit at three of the largest Tata companies, TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Power.Noting that for the first time its cash cow TCS saw a dip in profit in FY18, he warned that the management cannot pat itself on the back for the record high market capitalisation that crossed the Rs 7 trillion-mark which according him is not because of fundamentals but due to the massive share buyback.He also came out strongly against the clean-chit given by the Tata Sons board to R Venkataramanan, its nominee on the AirAsia India board and the managing trustee of Tata Trusts, ""without conducting any known independent investigation.""This the letter said is ""a continuing act of mismanagement and failure to carry out fiduciary duty"" and termed the board decision to allow Venkataramanan, has brought reputational risks to Tata Sons and the group to continue in his position as ""unprecedented"" as it has ""sent a terrible message to hundreds of thousands of Tata employees.""

2018-03-23,"Judging by recent developments in the insolvency journey of Binani Cement, one may think that go-ahead from a stressed asset's Committee of Creditors (CoC) does not mean much. But Tata Steel might have better luck in its attempt to acquire the debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.The salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group's steel business has announced this morning that that it has been declared the successful resolution applicant by the CoC of Bhushan Steel, subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. In its stock exchange filing, Tata Steel added that it has accepted the Letter of Intent for Bhushan Steel.This may feel like deja vu to those following this drama closely - two weeks back Tata Steel had announced pretty much the same thing. A company statement had said that the CoC had identified it as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire controlling stake of BSL at a meeting on March 6, adding that the next steps would be as per the stipulations under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. But, even as Tata Steel kick-started talks on finalising its resolution plan with the resolution professional and the CoC, the employees of the beleaguered company approached the NCLT with their objections. During the proceedings, senior advocate A.S. Chandhiok appearing for BSL employees submitted before the two-member NCLT bench that Tata Steel is an 'undischarged insolvent' and is not entitled under section 29 A of the IBC Code. The Tribunal had then directed the CoC to consider the objections raised by the employees. The latter reportedly had a meeting on March 20 and voted for Tata Steel a second time.Although Tata Steel did not disclose the financial details of the bid, two people close to the bidding process earlier told Mint that the company has offered close to Rs 34,800 crore as upfront payment to banks and an additional Rs 1,200 crore to the operational creditors. In addition, Tata Steel has also offered 12% equity stake to lenders in BSL, who were owed Rs 44,478 crore. BSL, which was on the RBI's first list of 12 companies to be referred to bankruptcy court, claims to be India's third largest secondary steel producer with an annual capacity of 5.6 million tonnes. So if the deal finally goes through, this acquisition will not only help Tata Steel tighten its grip on the country's eastern region but perhaps also help it to snatch the title of 'India's largest steel maker' from JSW Steel. According to advisory firm Bonaz Capital, the acquisition would help it to increase domestic steel capacity by around 43 per cent to 18.6 million tonnes per annum.This announcement will also bring much relief to fraud-ravaged Punjab National Bank, as it was the term loan consortium leader for Bhushan Steel. In fact, PNB reportedly had an exposure of close to Rs 5,000 crore, much of which will now come back to coffers and help it to partly offset the damage allegedly wrought by Nirav Modi over the past seven years.With PTI inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-wins-bid-acquire-bhushan-power/story/273216.html

Tata Motors has thirty service stations and a strong dealer network. Tata Power has power generation units in Odisha. IT company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has 5000 professionals and the second phase of expansion will take it to 12,000 professionals.

2018-11-28,"Bhushan Steel, which was recently acquired by Tata Steel, received approval from central government on Tuesday to change its name to Tata Steel BLS Ltd.A new certificate of incorporation has also been issued by the Registrar of Companies. Bhushan Steel is one of the prominent players in the Indian steel industry.In its second quarter results, Bhushan steel posted an over 23 per cent jump in its output at 1.05 million tonnes (MT).  Sales of Bhushan Steel rose by 10 per cent to 1.14 MT from 1.03 MT in the year-ago quarter. Tata Steel Ltd had won the bid to acquire debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) in an insolvency auction. The bankrupt firm was among the 12 stressed assets the RBI had referred for NCLT proceedings last year.

2018-04-02,"This was a victory that tycoon Anil Agarwal was unable to fully savour: Vedanta on Saturday announced that it had won the bidding war for Electrosteel Steels, pipping suitors like Tata Steel and  Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors. But, on the flip side, Abhishek Dalmia-led Renaissance Steel India today reportedly said that it will move the bankruptcy court, again, challenging the beleaguered firm's Committee of Creditors' (CoC) decision.In a statement released by Vedanta Limited, it said that ""it has been declared as the successful resolution applicant by the Committee of Creditors for Electrosteel Steels Limited under the corporate insolvency resolution process"" of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, adding that it ""has received a Letter of Intent (LoI) informing the Company about the same"". The company said that it accepted the terms of the LoI, but ""the closure of the transaction will be subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and as per the final terms approved by the National Company Law Tribunal"".According to The Hindu Business Line, Vedanta has offered to pay a little over Rs 5,000 crore for the distressed asset out on the block. This means a steep haircut of over 50% for the lenders. To remind you, Electrosteel Steels, with a debt of over Rs 11,000 crore, was among the first 12 large corporate accounts identified for insolvency resolution by the RBI last year. Of this, it owes around Rs 5,000 crore to State Bank of India alone and over Rs 191 crore to operational creditors.The daily added that the Resolution Professional (RP) submitted Vedanta's CoC-approved resolution plan before the Kolkata bench of NCLT today. During the next hearing, scheduled on April 4, the Bench comprising Justices Jinan KR and Madan Balachandra Gosavi will also hear Renaissance Steel's application challenging the CoC's decision. ""We are opposing the CoC's decision on eligibility of Vedanta and Tata. We also opposed the resolution plan (of Vedanta),"" said a counsel, appearing for Renaissance.Renaissance Steel, one of the resolution applicants for Electrosteel Steels, had earlier moved NCLT challenging the eligibility of two of its rival bidders under Section 29A of the IBC, which bars applicants that have ""been convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more"". It had claimed that Vedanta Resources Plc, holding company of Vedanta, had pleaded guilty to charges against its Konkola Copper Mines for violating violated pollution norms in Zambia back in 2010 while Tata Steel's UK subsidiary had violated the UK Health and Safety at Work Act.On March 20, the NCLT told the resolution professional to place all the objections of Renaissance Steel before the CoC for an ""independent consideration'' with supporting documents. This meeting reportedly took place last Thursday and the CoC voted for Vedanta.The latter is sure to put up a stiff fight against Renaissance since it has landed a sweetheart deal with this acquisition. Not only has it come cheap, but it is crucial to Vedanta's long-term plan.In a conference call in January to discuss the production results for Q3 FY 2018, Vedanta Resources CEO Kuldip Kaura had said ""We do not look at steel as a separate business really. We are currently the largest producer of iron ore in India and iron ore is our main business. In the growth of iron ore and allocation of mining leases, [government] stipulation usually is put for value addition and our looking at some of the steel assets is actually in view of that"". Given that one of Electrosteel Steels' assets in Jharkhand is located close to Vedanta's iron ore mines there, fits neatly with this scheme of things. And more profitable to boot.With IANS inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/renaissance-steel-to-challenge-vedanta-tata-steel-bids-for-electrosteel-steels/story/273914.html
2018-09-30,"After acquiring debt-laden Bhushan Steel through the insolvency and bankruptcy process, Tata Steel is now aiming to raise its production to 4 million tonne (MT) by the end of the current fiscal, an official said.Bhushan Steel's Odisha plant is presently operating at 3.5 MT against a capacity of 5 MT, the official said.""The Bhushan plant in Odisha has a capacity of 5 MT but is currently operating at 3.5 MT. We are working to raise the production at least to a level of 4 MT a year by March 2019 as demand remains robust,"" the official, who is part of the new team installed by Tata Steel in the company, told PTI.The Bhushan Steel plant is located close to Tata Steel's Kalinganagar facility where it has a 3 MT capacity.The official said the Kalinganagar plant expansion is on track despite Bhushan's takeover at Rs 36,000 crore.""Safety and environment aspects need to be strengthened in Bhushan Steel as they are not up to our (Tata Steel's) internal standards,"" he said.The new plant will follow Tata Steel's strategy of not just being a steel producer but a service company with extensive use of technology.Though Bhushan Steel will continue to be operated as a standalone outfit for the time being, a change of name is imminent to make it resemble a Tata company. The new management will be leveraging and complementing marketing strengths of Tata Steel, the official said.Tata Steel had earlier said there was a lot of synergies in taking over Bhushan Steel.Tata Steel took almost a decade to build 3 MT plant at Kalinganagar while the takeover of Bhushan Steel offered the steel major a readily available 5 MT plant, boosting its flat products.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-for-higher-capacity-utilisation-in-bhushan-steel/story/283246.html
2018-10-22,"Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran is one of the highest paid corporate bosses in India with his annual remuneration taking almost a 100 per cent jump in FY18. According to a latest annual report by the Tata Sons, Chandrasekaran got Rs 55.11 crore remuneration in FY 18, which also includes profit percentage and commission. Chandrasekaran was appointed as the Tata Sons Chairman in February 2017 after his 11-month stint as the MD of its tech conglomerate, Tata Consultancy Services, where he used to rake in around Rs 31.15 crore. But then, handling the country's 32 top holding companies -- of a business house like Tatas -- is also not a cakewalk, and the remuneration Chandrasekaran is getting justifies his salary, say industry analysts.His predecessor, Cyrus Mistry, used to get way less, about Rs 16 crore per year, than Chandrasekaran, who capped his annual salary as per the company performance. Mistry belongs to the Pallonji Mistry business family, and he, along with his brother, owns 18.4 per cent of share in Tata Sons. The Mistry brothers collectively hold the largest individual stake in the salt-to-software conglomerate.Cyrus Mistry was unexpectedly ousted as Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016, sparking a public war of words between him and former chairman Ratan Tata. Chandrasekaran was also the first non-Parsi to lead the multi-billion dollar business house. So far he has shown a balanced approach when it comes to his relationship with the Tata group stakeholders.With Chandrasekaran at the helm, the Tata group has tried a different approach of ""consolidation and synergy"", the Economic Times reported, while also making a foray into new ventures like aerospace and defence, and focussing more on its major revenue-generating vertical -- Tata Steel.Besides, hefty salaries in corporate India are not a new thing. India's highest paid promoters and professional executives got way more as annual compensation in FY18 than what Chandrasekaran is getting. Some of these include Kalanithi Maran (Sun TV Chairman) Rs 87.5 crore; Kavery Kalanithi (Sun TV Director) Rs 87.5 crore; Pawan Munjal, CMD and CEO of Hero Motorcorp, Rs 75.4 crore.However, this is also a fact that the salaries of Indian CEOs and promoters have seen a rise of around 19.3 per cent per year as compared to average corporate earnings, which grew at 13 per cent, in the past three years, the latest survey said. While the overall salaries of employees grew at just 10 per cent a year, the honchos of these listed companies accounted for top-earning heads. The CEOs are prospering in India but there has been no corresponding trickle-down effect, it revealed. Average salaries of employees in even highly prosperous companies are not increasing the way CEO emoluments are.Edited by Manoj Sharma",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/chandrasekaran-tata-group-chairman-got-rs-55-crore-annual-remuneration-fy18/story/285983.html
2018-04-06,"Tata Steel's India business has achieved highest-ever annual sales of 12.13 million tonne (MT) in the financial year ending March 2018--- a growth of 11 per cent compared to the previous year. It recorded the best-ever annual sales in the automotive sector, registering a growth of 21 per cent as against an industry growth of 14 per cent in this period. Tata Steel's global CEO and Managing Director, T. V. Narendran tells Business Today's Nevin John in an email interview that the company will complete the Kalinganagar Phase II expansion of 5 million tonne (MT) within 48 months from the board approval date with an investment of Rs 23,500 crore.Q: Steel prices are improving and demand too picking up and Tata Steel Group is sorting out its issues in Europe and is going for a JV with Thyssenkrupp. How these major factors will influence the performance of the company?A: Globally, the steel industry is in a better situation than it was a couple of years back.  China has taken supply side action which has reduced its exports, and the demand in both developing and developed countries is picking up which is reflected in better prices and more price stability.  Tata Steel is well positioned to leverage the opportunities this creates.  In Europe, through the JV, we are trying to create a stronger and more sustainable company, and in India, we are capitalising on opportunities for organic and inorganic growth.Q: In India, the large steelmakers are creating new capacities or buying assets, expecting a supply deficit by 2021. What is your long-term view on the Indian market, capacity creation and the margins?A: The consumption of steel in India is expected to at least mirror the GDP growth rate, if not do better than that in the medium to long term.  This is because of the infrastructure deficit we have and the Government's plans to address this infrastructure deficit.  Also, the increasing investments in the Indian market, the 'Make in India' initiative, the urbanisation trends and a growing middle class are also positives for steel demand. I believe that in India demand will outpace supply over the next few years and that should help the industry improve its margins which will in turn attract new investments in the industry.Q: Now, the global giants like ArcelorMittal are vying for sick assets for an entry into the Indian market. Will it be a challenge to Tata Steel, at least on client acquisition and pricing fronts?A: I think the Indian market has room for many strong players.  It will be good for our Industry as it will help us push each other to perform better, and it is good for the customers, and it is certainly good for the economy as it will lead to more investments and jobs.Q: What are your greenfield expansion plans and how much investment will be done to complete it?A: The Board has recently approved the Kalinganagar Phase II expansion which will take the plant to a capacity of 8 MT from the current level of 3 MT.  This will entail an expenditure of Rs 23,500 crore and we have promised to complete it in 48 months from the Board approval date.Q: Tata Steel India is better positioned in the case of raw material security -- iron ore 100 per cent and coal 30 per cent. Will there be any change when you add capacity in Kalinganagar? If so, how will you manage it?A: On iron ore, we will continue to invest to grow our production and feed our plants. For coal, we have limitations and will strive to stay at 30 per cent of our needs through our investments in our West Bokaro coal mines. We will also continue to participate in auctions wherever we find the blocks attractive to sustain our requirements over the long term.Q: What are going to be the short-term and medium-term challenges for the Indian steel business?A: In the short term, the profitability of the industry has to improve so that we can attract more investments in the industry to cater to the long-term needs of the country. We also need good quality capital equipment manufacturing facilities in India to reduce the dependence on imports. We need to attract and retain the right talent. We also need to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the Industry. The industry players have to improve the internal efficiencies and the government needs to help us reduce our costs outside the factory gates.Q: Who will get the management control in the European JV that you are planning with Germany's Thyssenkrupp? Will it be like Tata Steel just holding a stake in Europe business and not involving in day-to-day business?A: As announced earlier, it will be a 50:50 JV and the management structures and operating structures are currently under discussion. Both Thyssen and us are committed to create a strong European entity with a 'one company' structure.Q: What is your long-term view of the European business? What is your expectation on turnaround of business in Europe?A: The European business struggled because the market for steel in Europe collapsed post 2008 and it has been the last of the major markets to recover. Even today, steel consumption is not much different from what it was 10 years back.  However, we have taken a number of tough calls over the years and our colleagues in Europe have also worked hard to drive greater efficiencies and develop a richer product mix and a stronger market position. Since last year, we are also seeing a certain robustness for steel demand that we have not seen for a long time.  The JV will help us create a strong number 2 player in Europe and we have identified 400 to 600 million Euros per year of synergies for the combined entity. We are confident that we are moving in the right direction and are creating a strong and sustainable European business that is well positioned to capitalise on a recovering European market.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-steel-europe-thyssenkrupp-jv-will-have-eur400-million-eur600-million-annual-synergy-tata-steel-md-ceo-tv-narendran/story/274305.html
2018-05-19,"India has dragged the US to the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism over the imposition of import duties on steel and aluminium, an official said.India has stated that the decision will impact exports of these products to the US and it is not in compliance with global trade norms.""India has filed a dispute under the aegis of the WTO on the issue of imposing import duties by the US on certain steel and aluminium products,"" the official said.The country has sought consultations with the US under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism.Seeking consultation is the first step of dispute settlement process. If the two nations are not able to reach a mutually agreed solution through consultation, India may request for a WTO dispute settlement panel to review the matter.On March 9, US President Donald Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items, a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war.Trump signed two proclamations that levied a 25 per cent tariff on steel and a 10 per cent tariff on aluminium imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico.India too has sought exemptions from the hefty tariffs.Biswajit Dhar, the professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the US decision would not only impact India's export of these goods but would also affect global trade.India's exports of steel and aluminium products to America stood at about USD 1.5 billion every year.Some experts, however, opined that dragging the US in the dispute over the issue is not in favour of India as New Delhi has a trade surplus with America.India's exports to the US in 2016-17 stood at USD 42.21 billion, while imports were USD 22.3 billion.Both the countries are already involved in disputes at the global trade body.

2018-03-13,"As of 10.30 am today, a whopping 3,23,52,039 shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) got traded in bulk deals on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) as well as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). This includes two trades of 9.04 million shares and 7.5 million shares at 9.15 am that are the largest in at least a decade, if not more. In the bargain, the share price of the fastest growing IT services brand in the world - according to leading brand valuation firm, Brand Finance - cracked over 5% in the morning trade. TCS is currently trading flat at around Rs 2,898 apiece while the Sensex is up 0.18% at around 33,980.This follows media reports of Tata Sons planning to sell a 1.5% stake in TCS, worth nearly $1.3 billion (Rs 8,500 crore), through block deals. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are managing the TCS share sale, touted to be the biggest block trade this year at over 28 million shares. As per the deal term sheet, Tata Sons, which owned 73.5 percent of TCS as of end-December, would sell the shares in a price range of Rs 2,872 rupees to Rs 2,925 rupees apiece. That's a discount of 4-6% on TCS' Monday closing price of Rs 3,052 on the BSE.For the uninitiated, a ""bulk deal"" is a trade where a single investor buys/sells more than 0.5% of a company's total equity shares, either through single or multiple transactions. On the other hand, a ""block deal"" is a transaction of over 500,000 shares - or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore - executed through a single transaction. According to Motilal Oswal, these trades are done on a special window that opens for 35 minutes in the morning trading hours. The orders in a block deal are not shown to people who trade from normal trade window.According to The Economic Times, experts say that the proceeds of this sale may be used to deleverage the balance sheet of Tata Sons. The latter had to shell out $1.2 billion to NTT DoCoMo last year in order to settle the long-standing dispute with the Japanese telecom giant after it exited their joint venture in 2013.Then there is the debt of over Rs 40,000 crore owed by Tata Teleservices, even as the sale of the consumer wireless unit to Bharti Airtel awaits regulatory approvals. In 2017, Tatas had announced that Tata Teleservices will merge with Bharti Airtel on a no-debt, no-cash basis.  The proceeds from the TCS sale might be used to clear some of this debt.Incidentally, just last week Bloomberg had reported that Tata Sons is seeking an offshore syndicated loan to repay debt of units Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra. The $1.5 billion six-year loan is set to be the first offshore syndicated facility taken out by Tata Sons since 2007. The Group is clearly in a hurry to exit its troubled mobile telephony business.Other industry experts point out that Tata Sons may choose to use the TCS stake sale proceeds to fund Tata Steel, which is hoping to snap up Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power. Tata Steel is reportedly the highest bidder for both bankrupt companies with a total debt of Rs 60,000 crore.After this block deal, Tata Sons will hold about 73% in TCS, which generated $18 billion in revenues in fiscal 2017. TCS is the most-profitable unit within the $100 billion-plus Tata Group, and ranks among the top three most valuable brands in the global IT services sector along with IBM and Accenture.With Reuters inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-sons-sell-1.5-percent-stake-in-tcs-block-deals-balance-sheet-docomo/story/272486.html
2018-04-02,"A grouping led by world's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal, mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta and a consortium of Russias VTB Capital-backed NuMetal and JSW put in bids to takeover bankrupt Essar Steel in the second round of bidding on Monday. In the first round, NuMetal and ArcelorMittal were the only two parties that bid to buyout Essar Steel but the insolvency resolution professional overseeing the auction was advised to reject both the bids owing to their promoters being linked to defaulter companies. Revised bids were due on Monday. Sources privy to the development said three groups bid for Essar Steel. NuMetal, majority-owned by Russias second largest bank VTB Group, shed Aurora Trust, which has links to Rewant Ruia, son of Essar Steel promoter Ravi Ruia, in the second round of bidding. While its promoters bought out Aurora Trust's 25 per cent stake, NuMetal aligned with JSW to make the revised bid on Monday. ArcelorMittal, which had been disqualified in the first round for being listed as a promoter of loan defaulter Uttam Galva Steel, bid along with Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corporation. The global steel giant got itself declassified as a promoter of Uttam Galva Steel. The company sold its entire holding in Uttam Galva Steel before the first round of bids in February but its name had continued as a promoter on stock exchanges, resulting in its disqualification. Sources said Vedanta was the surprise entrant on Monday. Vedanta has already won a bid to acquire bankrupt Electrosteel Steels Ltd in an insolvency auction. Confirming bidding for Essar Steel, Anil Agarwal said the company has made a compelling bid. ""I have put a very lucrative bid. This is a great opportunity. When we want it, we must have it."" Six firms had initially put in expressions of interest to acquire Essar Steel, whose Rs 51,800 crore of outstanding debt claims have been admitted under the bankruptcy process. These firms included Tata Steel, state-owned SAIL, ArcelorMittal, NuMetal, Vedanta and Singapore-based fund SSG. Only ArcelorMittal and NuMetal put in bids in the first round on February 12. Sources said JSW was interested in acquiring Essar Steel after Tata Steels acquisition of bankrupt Bhushan Steel for Rs 35,200 crore gave it a pole position. But bankruptcy rules did not permit anyone who had not put in an EoI to bid and so it aligned with NuMetal for bidding on Monday. Rules also bar defaulting promoters from bidding. ""In pursuance to this strategy, JSW Steel Ltd in the capacity of an investor joined NuMetal & Steel Pvt Ltd in submitting a binding bid for Essar Steel Ltd, which is under the corporate insolvency resolution process as per the provisions of Insolvency Bankruptcy Code 2016,"" JSW Steel said in a statement. TyazhPromExports (TPE) of Russia and Indo International are the other shareholders of NuMetal. The Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which has been approached by NuMetal against the disqualification of first bid, on Monday ruled that second round of bids cannot be opened before April 4. Confirming bidding for Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal in a statement said its subsidiary ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd along with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC) put a revised bid on Monday. NSSMC is Japan's leading steel company, with capacity to produce approximately 50 million tons of crude steel per year with a reputation for innovation and high-quality products. ""ArcelorMittal and NSSMC have enjoyed a close collaboration for many decades cooperating high-quality downstream finishing facilities in the US including I/N Tek, I/N Kote and, since 2014, jointly acquired and turned around AM/NS Calvert which has state-of-the-art facilities in Alabama that had failed to reach its potential under its previous owner,"" the statement said. Lakshmi Mittal, the Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, said: ""The aim of the resolution process is to find a strong, new, capable owner for Essar Steel and maximise returns to creditors. We believe that ArcelorMittal, together with NSSMC, has the most relevant credentials and experience and is the most credible owner for Essar Steel given our decades of steel industry expertise, backed up by industry leading research and development and a wide range of innovative product capabilities."" He said the consortium is eligible and has made ""a strong and competitive offer"". ""At the heart of this offer is a compelling industrial plan that enhances and transforms the asset. (Essar Steels) Plant in Hazira is a big integrated steel-making facility that requires dedicated knowledge and technological expertise to de-bottleneck, grow, and enhance its product portfolio. ""We plan to commit significant capital expenditure to grow the asset, inject our proprietorial patents and processes and bring new high-quality products for industries such as automotive and solar to India,"" he said. Kosei Shindo, President of NSSMC, said India is the most promising steel market in the world, and NSSMC has been seeking opportunities to establish a significant presence in India. ""Essar Steel is a good asset with a lot of potential and I believe that NSSMC and ArcelorMittal could provide operational experience and access to the best of global technologies that will enable Essar Steel to reach its potential and greatly contribute to the turnaround of the Indian steel manufacturing sector,"" he said.

Mustafa Nadeem, CEO at Epic Research said,"" Nifty marks a fresh all-time high of 11565 as positive cues from global as well as domestic front triggers fresh buying. Nifty closed the day on a strong positive note as it ended a tad below the high at 11551.75. Bank Nifty lagged as it wasn't able to breach its previous swing high at 28380. The day was green on the back of large caps which carried the momentum such as Reliance, L&T, HDFC Twins, Tata motors followed by SBI.   Technically we have seen a momentum that is just beginning for next round of bullish rally. The recent consolidation in the range of 11350-11500 has led bulls to put in further smart money as weak money get out. This momentum as we previously mentioned is now seen to be stretched to 11600-11650. Since the earlier base was 11350, it is now shifted to 11500-11480 technically for this upward bounce. Any dips to these levels of support shall be played out in favor of bulls. Derivatives data also suggest writing activity at 11400-11500 PE adding short built up while long built up to continue to increase with fresh positions for upsides at 11600-11700. We suggest buying on dips and maintain the higher target for Nifty.""

In addition, they expect that the bids may go up the size of over Rs 35,000 crore, when Essar's loans  stands at around Rs 45,000 crore.  At the same time, they are still confused on the fate of the second round of bid, which was termed invalid by the NCLT about a week back. After NCLT's order, the lenders opened the first round of bids and in which ArcelorMittal is believed to have emerged as the largest bidder with an offer of over Rs 30,000 crore.Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW group, had earlier evinced his interest in participating in the bid and JSW Steel had written to the lenders about their wish to submit the bid. If it's going for a new round, Jindal is expected to get the chance to submit his proposal.After Rewant Ruia, son of Essar group co-founder Ravi Ruia, exited from the Numetal Consortium, which bid in the first round, JSW Steel joined the consortium which is led by Russian financing company VTB. But still it's not clear whether Jindal would prefer the consortium or form another one with his trusted partners like Aion and JFE Steel Corporation, say sources.However, the unanswered question in the whole process is the eligibility of potential bidders. ArcelorMittal has started the process for disassociating itself from other bankrupt companies like Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. But some are saying the sale of stakes won't absolve them of responsibility of the stakeholder. JSW Steel is the only bidder for Monnet Ispat and the insolvency process is about to be completed.Another likely bidder, Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources had submitted its bid in the second round, which hasn't yet opened. Vedanta has already bagged ElectroSteel Steels. Since the bid price of Essar is likely to go up in the fresh round, can Jindal and Agarwal take the financial load to counter the bid of global steel giant ArcelorMittal is the question, industry experts say.If LN Mittal's firm qualifies for the bid, they clearly have a financial edge.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/fresh-bid-for-essar-steel-may-see-jindal-vs-mittal-vs-agarwal/story/275617.html

2018-09-19,"India's steel ministry has proposed increasing the effective import duty on some steel products to 15 percent from current rates ranging from 5 percent to 12.5 percent, according to two sources and a government document reviewed by Reuters, as the country looks to support the rupee. The proposal, which is part of a broader government plan to cut ""non-necessary"" imports to stop an outflow of dollars that has sent the rupee to record lows, will be discussed in the trade ministry on Wednesday, according to one source with knowledge of the matter.""The broader message is to address the trade balance but we will try to promote 'Make in India' by encouraging domestic (steel) production,"" said the source, who declined to be named ahead of a possible decision.The source said there was no certainty that the proposed duty would be imposed.The steel and trade ministries did not respond to requests seeking comment. Shares of Indian steel companies jumped after the news. In afternoon trading, JSW Steel Ltd was up 3.3 percent, while Tata Steel Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd rose by more than 2 percent. State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd also rose by more than 2 percent.The Indian government last week announced a slew of steps aimed at stemming a steep decline in the rupee.The currency hit a record low of 72.99 on Tuesday, making it Asia's worst performer amid a widening trade deficit and an emerging market selloff. It strengthened slightly on Wednesday on talk of central bank selling of the dollar, but is still down more than 13 percent this year.India's steel imports totaled $6.5 billion in 2017/18, according to official data.In the three months to end-June, the country became a net steel importer for the first time in two years, with foreign supplies reaching 2.1 million tonnes, up 15 percent from a year earlier.Japan and South Korea, with which India has free trade agreements, accounted for 45 percent of the 8.4 million tonnes of steel imported in the latest financial year to end-March. The proposed duties may not apply to those imports, but other steel suppliers such as China, South Africa, Malaysia, Russia and Indonesia could be affected.Other products eyedApart from steel, India is considering raising import duties on some farm commodities, potentially for a few months, although it is wary of the risks of retaliation, said a senior government official with knowledge of inter-ministerial deliberations on proposed restrictions.The government is also looking at curbs on imports of gold and high-end electronic items, a trade ministry source said last week.India is the world's second biggest gold buyer, and its imports in August rose more than 90 percent to $3.64 billion.The World Gold Council, however, warned on Wednesday against any further curbs on the metal which already attracts a 10 percent tariff, the largest India has imposed. ""Indian demand is down 7 percent over last year which itself was down over the previous year,"" the industry body's India managing director, Somasundaram PR, said at an industry event.""There are discussions about non-essential imports, but I still believe and I hope that this does not actually in any sense hit gold this time.""",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/amid-rupee-fall-govt-mulls-raising-import-duty-on-steel/story/282566.html

Whatever iron ore we have today, their requirement will be for the next 20-25 years. After that whatever steel is there will get recycled, and then the dependence on iron ore is going to be reduced,"" he said.Noting that when there is iron ore in India, and there was no need to import it, Nowal said, ""we are importing because of lesser production."" Referring to the situation in Ballari as an example, he said ""...requirement of the industry is 32 million tonnes, production is 28 million, and there is a shortage of 4 million, which is being sourced from outside Karnataka like Odisha or imports. I can say it is very funny when we have so many reserves.""

2018-08-07,"The prolonged battle for the debt-ridden Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL), among the RBI's first list of the Dirty Dozen, has just gotten stretched out even more. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) yesterday extended the deadline for revised bid submission by yet another week, so things are unlikely to wrap up anytime soon.The Tribunal pushed back the deadline to August 13 on the plea of Tata Steel, which had been declared the highest bidder in July - for the second time. But then the googly bowled by JSW Steel, another contender in the race for BPSL, threw a spanner into the works. JSW had upped its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore just ahead of the meeting of the bankrupt company's Committee of Creditors (CoC) to finalise a vote, which was higher than Tata Steel's Rs 17,000 crore bid.So the latter approached the NCLAT challenging the bid revision. On August 1, a bench headed by Chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya passed an interim order allowing all the three parties - Liberty House being the third contender - to upgrade their respective offers by August 6.The disgruntled Tata Steel then moved Supreme Court against the NCLAT's order and the matter is scheduled to be heard on Friday this week. Given the above, the counsel appearing for Tata Steel had requested the NCLAT to extend the deadline for submission of the revised bids. It had argued that if the CoC takes a decision based on the revised offers before the apex court rules on the matter, then their position may be altered after the Friday hearing.Hence, the tribunal decided to shift the deadline for bid submissions by a week to August 13. Thus, the already dragged-out BPSL case - courtesy the legal tussle with Liberty House - will continue to play out in courts. To remind you, BPSL, which owes about Rs 45,000 crore to a consortium of lenders led by Punjab National Bank, had been admitted by the NCLT on July 26, 2017.That would mean that BPSL has exceeded the 270-day deadline specified for insolvency resolution by over 100 days. However, the appellate tribunal has excluded the duration of the pending appeal from the resolution time frame.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/battle-for-bhushan-power-and-steel-nclat-extends-bid-deadline-yet-again/story/281079.html

The tribunal accepted the resolution plan put forward by Vedanta for acquiring the business of Electrosteel Steels Ltd. According to a person close to the development, Vedanta is offering close to Rs 5,000 crore for buying the debt-laden steel manufacturer from Kolkata.The total claims of financial creditors was around Rs 10,000 crore, which means the banks have taken a 50 per cent haircut. The bankruptcy proceeding against the steel-maker was initiated by State Bank of India, which claimed in its application that the Kolkata-based company owed it around Rs 2,500 crore in principal and interest. There were 26 financial creditors in the committee of creditors, all of which agreed to the resolution plan of Vedanta. There were three bidders for Electrosteel -- Vedanta, Tata Steel and Renaissance Steel.According to the person quoted above, the other bidders can appeal against the decision of NCLT.

2018-07-09,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday dismissed the petitions of Cyrus Mistry challenging his removal as Tata Sons chairman and alleging that group patriarch Rata Tata's conduct was prejudicial to the company. A special bench of the tribunal held that the Board of Directors at Tata Sons was competent to remove Mistry as the executive chairperson of the company. NCLT bench members B S V Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy said that Mistry was ousted as chairman because the Tata Sons' Board and its majority shareholders had lost confidence in him. Mistry, who was ousted from the board of Tata Sons after a four-year stint in October 2016, claimed in his petition to NCLT in December 2016 that he was illegally removed as chairman of the software-to-salt conglomerate. He had also pointed out corporate governance lapses and insider trading in the group. Reading out the judgment's operative part, the bench said Mistry sent out crucial information related to Tata firms to the Income Tax Department, leaked information to the press, and after that he came out in public against the company and its board members. The removal of Cyrus Mistry as executive chairperson was because the board lost confidence and not because they were contemplating that he would cause discomfort to Ratan Tata, Soonawala (the group trustee) and other respondents, the judgment added. The tribunal also rejected Mistry's allegations against Tata Sons Board and Ratan Tata of mismanagement of affairs and oppression of minority shareholders. It also rejected all allegations of lapses in governance on part of the group when it came to AirAsia, Nano and Aircel, and of a breakdown of corporate governance. The bench said it had found no merit in Mistry's allegations and concluded that the Board was acting in accordance with the Companies Act of 2013.Ratan Tata, on his part, said, ""The judgement of the NCLT has been a vindication of the actions that Tata Sons felt obliged to take in October 2016. It is a reinforcement of the principles and forthrightness that prevails in our judicial system, which should make all of us proud of our country and its democracy."" ""The ruling is in line with the earlier position expressed by the Tribunal. An appeal on merits will be pursued,"" a statement from Mistry's office said. The statement described the ruling as disappointing although not surprising. It said Mistry would continue to strive for ensuring good governance and protection of interests of minority shareholders and all stakeholders in Tata Sons from the wilful brute rule of the majority. Not only the facts that were under consideration but also subsequent facts and developments that continue to evidence oppression and mismanagement will be under scrutiny and will be pursued in full earnest, the statement added. Mistry's family, through a set of two investment firms, holds around 18 percent in Tata Sons, making his family the single biggest shareholder of the conglomerate.The Tata Trusts, a group of public charities, hold over 66 percent in the group company. The Trusts are currently chaired by Tata family patriarch Ratan Tata. Welcoming the order, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran hoped that a finality will be given to the judgement of NCLT, by all concerned in the larger interest of companies, the shareholders and the public. The judgement has only reaffirmed and vindicated Tata Sons and its operating companies have always acted in a fair manner and in the best interest of its stakeholders, he said in a statement.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/nclt-rejects-cyrus-mistrys-charges-against-tata-sons-ratan-tata/story/280106.html

2018-12-25,"Tasked with a key job of helping recover unpaid corporate loans, the NCLT has helped resolve insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings involving more than Rs 80,000 crore in the year passing-by and the kitty is expected to swell beyond Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019 with several big-ticket default cases pending.Plans are afoot to further strengthen the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by increasing number of judges and benches and provide adequate infrastructure to fast-track the process, according to government officials.The new year will not only test the mettle of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), but also of the NCLT and its appellate body NCLAT, as several high-profile cases need to be resolved -- Essar Steel (involving over Rs 80,000 crore alone) and Bhushan Power & Steel (about Rs 45,000 crore due to its lenders) are just a few, experts said.In 2018, over Rs 80,000 crore was recovered from various corporate debtors, which had defaulted payments, under the IBC through various insolvency proceeding at the NCLT and the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal), Ministry of Corporate Affair Secretary Injeti Srinivas told PTI.Also Read: Hindustan Unilever told to pay Rs 383 crore for not passing lower GST benefit to customersAs per estimates, the IBC has helped address stressed assets worth approximately Rs 3 lakh crore -- directly or indirectly -- since the new law came into force in December 2016.""The estimated amount includes recoveries made through resolution plan and cases settled before admission by the NCLT,"" he added.In 2019, the NCLT is expected to finalise corporate insolvency resolution process of several stressed assets through its 11 functional benches across India. These cases would include Essar Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel, Videocon Group, Monnet Ispat, Amtek Auto, Ruchi Soya, Lanco Infratech, Jaypee Infratech among others.Acording to law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Executive Partner Punit Dutt Tyagi, the new year is likely to ""test the mettle of the IBC as well as of the NCLT and NCLAT"".""Most of the major cases pending before the NCLT are likely to be resolved and these debtors are likely to come into hands of successful bidders,"" he added.In 2018, insolvency proceedings against some companies including Bhushan Steel, ElectroSteel Steel, Binani Cement were almost completed and the new management from their successful bidders -- Tata Steel, Vedanta group and Adity Birla-led UltraTech, respectively -- have taken over the management control of the stressed assets.Big Corporate houses including Arcelor Mittal, Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, UltraTech Cement, UK-based Liberty Group, Vedanta group, Dalmia Bharat group were among the leading companies which had submitted their resolution plans to acquire the debt ridden firms.Other major insolvency cases being handled by the NCLT and the NCLAT include RCom, Videocon group, Alok Industries, Lanco Infrateck, Jaypee Infratech, Jyoti Structures and ABG Shipyard.Although, the IBC mandates completion of insolvency proceedings within 180 days of appointment of a resolution professional by the NCLT, with provision for a further extension of 90 days totalling to 270 days, several matters are running behind the schedule.""Although the 270-day deadline could not be met in a majority of the cases, the NCLTs and the NCLAT have largely delivered well-reasoned decisions. It is commendable since these tribunals are not just applying the settled law, but also interpreting new legislation such as the IBC,"" Tyagi said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has appeared in some major IBC cases including of Essar Steel, said there is a shortage of staff and the government should appoint more judges.""The NCLAT is managing well despite the odds. Judicially, they need many more members, at least double more. They are also hugely under-staffed. It's more quantity (that is required), but quality of staff also needs serious up-gradation,"" Singhvi said.He also said the NCLAT premises are cramped and squeezed.The senior lawyer said a huge workload is difficult to handle with such severe infrastructure problems and these issues must be addressed immediately by the government.""There is no point in creating institutions and then crippling them,"" he added.According to Srinivas, there are around 10,000 cases pending before the NCLT and the NCLAT at different stages and most of the new cases coming at these quasi-judicial forums are from the insolvency side.""The government is focusing on these issues by increasing the number of members at NCLT and NCLAT. We would open more benches as per requirement and provide them more support in terns of trained staff, specially the young professionals and assistants, who would help the benches directly by doing research etc,"" Srinivas said.He further said, ""We are putting a lot of emphasis on capacity building because these are all complex laws and new challenges keep coming. Whatever best capacity development can be done by holding seminars, conferences, all that has been done. We have tried to de-clog the NCLT.""

2018-02-05,"The much delayed insolvency resolution proceedings for Bhushan Steel has finally made it to the second stage. Bids for the debt-ridden company were submitted day before yesterday-after being pushed back multiple times-and the highest bidder is expected to be announced tomorrow. In the running are JSW Steel, Tata Steel and a group of employees of Bhushan Steel along with a private equity firm, according to The Economic Times. While the much-hyped bidding process for the maker of auto grade steel had generated a lot of interest at home and abroad, several interested parties-including ArcelorMittal, Steel Authority of India and UK-based Liberty House-ultimately did not submit resolution plans to Deloitte's Vijaykumar V. Iyer, the appointed insolvency resolution professional.JSW Steel has reportedly bid in partnership with Piramal Enterprises. A third partner, Japan's JFE Steel Corp, reportedly backed out a day before the deadline for bids. Though the liquidation value had been set at Rs 15,000 crore-this is the minimum value set for a stressed asset by the committee of creditors, below which bids are not accepted-""looking at the competition, JSW Steel is expected to double its bid amount. It can be between Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore,"" a source earlier told PTI. That's not surprising, given that JSW Steel is known to be in expansion mode. It is also evaluating opportunities for acquisitions to achieve the target of increasing manufacturing capacity to 40 million tons by 2030.Bhushan Steel's annual capacity of 5.6 million tonne-according to its website it is the third largest secondary steel producer in the country-could give it a leg up. It will also provide JSW Steel a gateway to the east and north, as most existing facilities of the beleaguered company are concentrated in the east. Similarly, for Tata Steel, historically concentrated around Jamshedpur, the acquisition makes sense as it will help to tighten its grip on the eastern region. Bhushan Steel was on RBI's first list of 12 companies to be referred to the National Company Tribunal Law (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings, which together accounted for 25% of total bank NPAs. According to the latest Economic Survey, claims admitted under the insolvency proceedings for the maker of auto grade steel stand at a whopping Rs 55,989 crore. That makes it the biggest bankruptcy, so far, to go under the hammer. Essar Steel, Monnet Ispat and Electrosteel Steels are the other major players in this space currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. It will be interesting to see if the group of 400-500 employees of Bhushan Steel, who have reportedly submitted a resolution plan in partnership with a Singapore-based firm, will be able to recreate a David versus Goliath win.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/bhushan-steel-auction-jsw-tata-employees-bidders/story/269746.html

That left a lasting impression on me and really inspired me to pursue an active career in industry. I see Industrial Cadets fulfilling the same function and am very excited about the impact it is facing,"" Gupta said.His GFG Foundation is actively involved in funding and promoting the Industrial Cadets programme, through a partnership with the Engineering Development Trust.GFG Alliance companies, including Liberty House and SIMEC, currently support 1,300 cadets from 26 schools across Britain to participate in the scheme, with a target of 5,000 students by next year.Around 26 GFG executives located at 13 industrial sites in the UK are regularly engaged in organising work placements at their respective plants, helping the youngsters to maximise the benefit they the get from time spent in the group's steelmaking, engineering, power generation and manufacturing facilities. GFG also has an active apprenticeship training programme currently involving more than 100 young people in the UK.Gupta said that the task of ensuring the next generation has the motivation and skills to enable the UK to remain competitive and successful on the world stage in manufacturing as one of the most important tasks facing modern society.As part of his role as ambassador, the 46-year-old businessman has also been tasked with establishing Industrial Cadets in Australia, where the GFG Alliance already employs 6,000 people in its integrated mining, steel and energy businesses.The GFG Alliance is a London-headquartered international group of businesses, founded and owned by the UK-based Gupta family.The vision of GFG Alliance is to promote industrial revival based on low-carbon and sustainable production methods through its GreenAluminium and GreenSteel strategies.Last month, the group's Liberty Speciality Steels reignited one of the arc furnaces mothballed by Tata Steel in 2015 at the height of the steel crisis in northern England. Liberty, as part of the wider GFG Alliance, has created and safeguarded hundreds of jobs in the steel sector across the UK as a result of a series of acquisitions.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/prince-charles-indian-origin-steel--uk-ambassador/story/272186.html
2018-03-29,"When the battle for 10 million tonne (MT) Essar Steel goes back to square one, with a re-bid deadline of April 2, the same 'ineligible bidders' plan to make a comeback with new bids for acquisition. ArcelorMittal, one of the two bidders who had submitted the bid in the first round, says it doesn't mind fresh bids. However, the second bidder Numetal Mauritius is still figuring out its plans to meet the qualification criteria.The industry experts expect that the competition for Essar Steel will mainly play out between these two again. In addition to these two, there were three more companies, Vedanta Resources, Tata Steel and Nippon Steel, who had submitted expressions of interests (EoIs) for Essar Steel.Anil Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta, had said earlier that his company is not keen to bid for Essar as they are not in the steel sector. Tata Steel already has a lot on its plate after it emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel. The combined offer value of these two bids comes to around Rs 59,000 crore, when Tata Steel owes Rs 83,000 crore of consolidated debt. In addition, the steelmaker has Rs 23,500 crore worth of expansion plan for Kalinganagar plant on cards. Japan's Nippon Steel has signed a joint venture (JV) formation agreement with ArcelorMittal, along with Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC), to acquire and manage Essar Steel.Essar Steel is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings after failing to repay its loans totaling Rs 45,000 crore to lenders. According to bankers, only the applicants who had initially submitted EOIs would be eligible to bid in the second round. However, the experts are concerned whether the sell off can be concluded within the 270 days timeframe provided under the new insolvency and bankruptcy law.After the first round of bids, the resolution professional had told Essar Steel's lenders that both the bids, Numetal and ArcelorMittal, were found to be not eligible; thus effectively re-opening the bid process. In order to be eligible to bid, VTB Bank of Russia, the leader in the consortium Numetal, would buy the 25 per cent stake of a trust controlled by one of the estranged promoters of Essar, Rewant Ruia. VTB Bank plans to buy the stake before April 2, the last day for submitting the second round of bids, sources said.ArcelorMittal's bid was rejected in the first round as it had 29 per cent stake in bankrupt firm Uttam Galva. Besides, its chairman LN Mittal had 33 per cent stake KSS of Kazakhstan, which in turn held 100 per cent in KSS Petrona, a non-performing asset (NPAs) in India. The Uttam Galva stake has been sold back to its promoters, Miglani family. But there is no clarity on KSS Petron stake.ArcelorMittal and Numetal had earlier approached the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against the resolution professional's decision to disqualify them.

The closure of the transaction will be subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and as per the final terms approved by the National Company Law Tribunal, it added.The Reserve Bank of India had named Electrosteel Steels among the first 12 large corporate accounts that were identified for insolvency resolution in June last year.

It owes Rs 191.6 crore to operational creditors, the resolution professional had acknowledged.Vedanta got a sweet deal out of this acquisition as one of Electrosteel Steels' assets in Jharkhand is close to Vedanta's iron ore mines there. The entry into steel was aimed at converting iron ore from its mine as it is more profitable, he'd added.Vedanta had reportedly became the highest bidder after quoting Rs 4,500 crore for the Electrosteel steels. In tow was Tata Steel with a bid of Rs 3,500 crore.

2018-05-21,"There is no question in the minds of the international community that steel consumption is bound to grow in India, for it is clear that the present generation already demands a better quality of life and the next generation certainly will. This is because the level of consumption of steel is known to be one of the key indices for measuring the quality of life.Favourable outlook for steel consumptionAfter almost a decade of limping growth, the significant recovery of the global economy as well as that of the Global Steel Industry in 2017 also points to a favourable outlook for the Indian steel industry. While global production of crude steel at 1,691 million tonne (MT) noted a growth of 5.3 per cent in 2017 over the previous year, the estimated steel consumption rose to 1,622 MT. The latest Internal Monetary Fund projection has estimated the global economy is slated to grow at 3.9 per cent in 2018, and India's GDP is to move up by 7.4 per cent in 2018 as compared to 6.7 per cent in the previous year. The continued growth in GDP in India, in fact, indicates that major steel consuming segments such as construction, real estate/housing, capital goods/machinery, consumer goods, automobiles and energy sector shall benefit.The housing and construction sector, where major chunk of steel is consumed, shall get a boost with increase in per capita incomes and social sector schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna-Housing for All, Sardar Patel Urban Housing Mission, 100 Smart Cities Mission (by 2022), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna, Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small & Medium Towns (UIDSSMT), National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY), Bharatmala project, 24x7 Power for All initiative (by 2019), Development of Industrial Corridors & National Investment & Manufacturing Zones, 75,000 MW Clean-Energy initiative (by 2022) and many others. In a nutshell, with the increasing thrust on the ""Make-in-India"" vision by the Indian Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian steel industry itself will grow and will be in a position to supply the required quantities and grades of steel much needed by the end-users. This also given the fact that the per capita finished steel consumption remains at a dismal 60 kgs, in contrast with the world average of around 220 kgs. The recently formed Global Forum on Excess Steel Capacity has acknowledged India's capacity expansion of steel as a function of growing consumption in the domestic market.Looming threat of imports, like in the pastIn spite of clear signals of recovery today, it is important to keep in mind challenges of the past that plagued the industry. Over the past few years, the global steel industry has been reeling under the pressure of overcapacities, especially on account of those existing in China. With the growth in steel consumption slowing down in China in recent times, the Chinese steel producers have had no option but to rely on exports. This in turn has had an impact on high growth centres of steel consumption in ""steel-non-mature"" nations such as India. Additionally, depreciation of major currencies has led to a spurt in export by several countries like Russia and Ukraine. It was for these reasons that India saw an influx of imports beginning 2014-15 from several countries, including China. The surge in imports impacted the sentiment of the domestic steel market, with declining capacity utilisation rates of both the primary and secondary steel players. Additionally, erosion of margins, coupled with sluggish demand growth, made the Indian steel investors wary of returns on their investment. However, the Government of India came out proactively to provide a level playing field to Indian companies through imposition of anti-dumping and safeguard duties as well as minimum import prices, wherever injury to the industry was noteworthy.Given the recent imposition of tariffs by the United States as an outcome Section 232 investigation of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the ""steel-mature"" countries like China, Japan, South Korea, etc. will look at India with immense interest. The Indian Steel Association has continued to highlight the long term distortions that such high level of cheap imports bring into the domestic market. Under the new global circumstances that pervade the trade scenario, imposition of Quality Control Order(s) is a step in the right direction by the Ministry of Steel to control imports of seconds and defectives into India, which jeopardise the safety of the Indian end-consumer.Current challengesThe Indian Steel Industry continues to grapple with uncertainties pertaining to the availability and consistent supplies of raw materials i.e. both coal and iron ore still remain a challenge, with recent closure of mines in Goa adding to the woes of the industry. Even though the marked shift from an allocation process to an auction process of getting mining blocks has brought about considerable transparency; issues pertaining to transport logistics from the mining areas need to be sorted out to mitigate lag in evacuation of iron ore, coal and other minerals. Indian Steel Association has identified that ""handholding"" from the various state governments in such matters is very essential and has embarked upon bringing such issues to the attention of state government authorities, beginning with Odisha. Additionally, the resolution process of debt ridden steel companies currently underway at the NCLT shall necessitate a marked change in the structure of the industry.Stress on investments and capacity addition by Indian steel companiesIn spite of the threat of imports, Indian steel enterprises invested hugely into modernisation and expansion of their existing units as well as green-field plants to build a world class, cost competitive, environment-friendly and socially responsible industry. This is in line with the objectives of the National Steel Policy 2017 to increase the Per Capita Steel Consumption to 160 Kgs by 2030-31 from the current 60 kgs. This will necessitate a steel capacity of the tune of 300 MTPA from the current 128 MTPA. The Indian steel industry is fully geared for this, alongside stressing on remaining competitive. This can be substantiated from the fact that as per the list of 'World Class Steel Makers in the World' released by World Steel Dynamics in June 2017, 36 steel makers were classified as World Class Steel Makers out of more than 250 large steel makers in the world. Within the list of 36, six Steel Makers from India namely JSW Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, JSPL, RINL & Essar Steel qualified as World Class. The steel industry is capable of achieving much more alongside contributing to public cause, as an increasingly enabling policy environment is provided by the Government.

We are seeking a legal opinion and based on that opinion we will take a call,"" Rao told the daily.Given the Supreme Court last week set out the course of action for Essar's lenders as well as the interested bidders, it seems likely that that the Sajjan Jindal-led company will have to again knock on the apex court's doors to get permission to bid separately.On October 4, the Supreme Court had exercised its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution to allow ArcelorMittal and Numetal to submit fresh bids for Essar Steel provided they clear their NPA dues in two weeks. So basically, steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal has to clear the Rs 7,000 crore outstanding debt of the two companies it previously held stakes in, namely Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, in order to be considered eligible to bid. And Numetal would reportedly be eligible to bid after it pays off its dues of Rs 49,000 crore.Moreover, the Supreme Court granted the CoC a final eight-week window to finalise a bid, failing which the steel company will go into liquidation. The court also diluted the role of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), adding that they would step in only after resolution plans were approved by a majority (66%) of the CoC in the prescribed deadline.Despite the fact that Essar Steel boasts the third biggest debt pile (around Rs 49,000 crore) among the Dirty Dozen, it is a big prize to land and has hence seen very aggressive bidding. According to the daily, ArcelorMittal is understood to have offered Rs 42,000 crore for it, while Numetal's bid is believed to be in the region of Rs 37,000 crore. The bid by Anil-Agarwal promoted Vedanta trails at around Rs 35,000 crore. It's anybody's guess how fat a cheque JSW Steel would be willing to sign, if allowed to enter the race.The development comes as JSW Steel is fighting to retain its position as India's leading steel maker. Tata Steel has emerged a strong contender for the title having recently got the NCLT's nod to acquire Bhushan Steel, now renamed Tata Steel BSL. Moreover, if it also gets control of Bhushan Power and Steel, it would be able to add nearly three million tonne of capacity.  Hence, acquiring Essar Steel - which boasts a 10 million tonne steel plant in Gujarat, India's largest single-location flat steel plant - independently fits neatly into JSW Steel's ambitions. It has reportedly targeted owning 25 million tonne of steel-making capacity in India in the near term.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/battle-for-essar-steel-jsw-steel-now-wants-to-bid-independently/story/284542.html
2018-01-28,"In a bid to give tough competition to competitors, JSW Steel is expected to double its bid value for debt-laden Bhushan Steel, a source privy to the development said.The last date to submit the bids now is 3 February 2018.On January 24, the insolvency resolution professional (IRP) of Bhushan Steel had extended the deadline for submission of resolution plans to 3 February 2018 from 25 January 2018. ""The liquidation value has set been set at Rs15,000 crore, below that the bid will not be accepted.Looking at the competition, JSW Steel is expected to double its bid amount. It can be between Rs25,000 crore to Rs30,000 crore,"" the person aware of the development said. Liquidation value is the minimum value set for a stressed asset by the committee of creditors. Below that bid will not be accepted.Luxembourg-based multinational steel firm ArcelorMittal and domestic industry major Tata Steel are also in the race for Bhushan Steel, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings.JSW Steel has decided to bid for Bhushan Steel, maker of auto-grade steel in India, in a team. It has roped in its Japanese business partner JFE Steel Corp and Piramal Enterprises, which is the flagship firm of Piramal Group, for the purpose.Bhushan Steel, one of the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India for National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings, owes an amount of Rs44,478 crore to its lenders. According to the information on Bhushan Steel Ltd website, the company is the 3rd largest secondary steel producer in the country with an existing steel production capacity of 5.6 million tonne per annum.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/jsw-steel-may-offer-rs-30000-crore-for-debt-laden-bhushan-steel/story/268977.html
2018-03-26,"India's largest steelmaker JSW Steel on Monday announced it would consider an investment of upto $500 million in phases to develop its steel manufacturing infrastructure in Baytown in Texas. JSW would be aided by a $3.4 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund as part of the memorandum signed with the Governor of Texas.The investment would be made to undertake capability enhancement of its Plate & Pipe Mill unit located in the region. JSW, which has now rechristened its US operations as JSW USA, is already investing $150 million to augment the unit's capabilities. This capex programme is expected to be completed by March 2020. JSW USA intends to use rest of the investment, up to US $350 million, to set-up a new hot end facility to make their steel 'melt and manufacture' (subject to approvals). Around 500 new jobs are expected to be generated by this expansion.It comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump hiking tariff on steel and aluminium industry to encourage the domestic industry.""The Memorandum signed by Greg Abbott and JSW USA is part of our long-term strategy to enhance our US footprint. It reiterates our commitment to stay invested and grow in the US market,"" said Parth Jindal of JSW Group. ""It also provides JSW USA with an opportunity to participate in USA's infrastructure development and job creation priorities. Access to natural gas at extremely economical prices and the abundant availability of scrap steel in Texas make conditions very conducive to manufacturing through the Electric Arc Furnace route.""JSW USA operates one of the widest steel plate and pipe mills in North America. Strategically located in Baytown, Texas, approximately 30 miles outside Houston, the unit services the needs of the energy, petrochemicals, defence and other heavy equipment industries in the USA who need high-quality carbon plate.The company had bought the plant more than a decade ago as part of the acquisition of three companies in the US for $900 million (around Rs 3,690 crore) to get a foothold in the North American market. Known for its penchant for acquiring stressed assets and then turning them around, these were however, not one of JSW's better acquisitions.While the three units were all loss-making in 2006-07, with net losses of $42 million against revenues of $510 million, JSW had expected to recover costs, including that of the acquisition, in four years.Instead the company has had to write-off loans worth Rs 6,208.74 crore to the US holding company. In the first quarter of this fiscal, the US plate and pipe mill had an operating income of $5.1 million on revenues of $58.67 million, which suggest it is showing signs of recovery. However, JSW Steel (US) is still consistently making losses.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/donald-trump-jsw-steel-usa/story/273412.html
2018-07-05,"Locked in a direct fight to acquire Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal today sought disqualification of Russia's VTB Capital-backed NuMetal Ltd, alleging that the firm was acting in concert with delinquent promoters of Essar group but the NCLAT hearing the case did not agree to its contention.When first bids for loan defaulter Essar Steel were called in February, Rewant owned 25 per cent in Mauritius-based investment vehicle NuMetal. VTB Group bought out Aurora Trust to cure its ineligibility as bankruptcy rules disqualify owners of distressed assets from bidding for those assets in the insolvency process.At a hearing before a two-member bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for ArcelorMittal, said ""NuMetal and Rewant Ruia are alter ego of each other. They both are the same.""He alleged that the two are acting in concert with each other.The NCLAT bench posed several probing questions, including whether a company can be considered to be an alter-ego of its shareholder - especially when such minority shareholder is neither in management or control of the company (NuMetal).It observed that question of disqualification of NuMetal on the ground that one of its minority shareholders is related to promoters of Essar requires substantiation based on law.The NCLAT also observed that allegations of NuMetal acting in concert with the promoters of ESIL cannot be based on general analysis and needs be substantiated with legal grounds in accordance with law.The NCLAT is hearing cross-petitions filed by NuMetal and ArcelorMittal challenging each other's eligibility to bid for Essar Steel which is being auctioned after the company defaulted on payment of Rs 51,800 crore loans to lenders.NuMetal wants ArcelorMittal disqualified because it was the promoter of loan defaulting companies, Uttam Galva Steel and KKS Petron. The world's largest steelmaker says it has paid Rs 7,000 crore of loans of Uttam Galva Steel to cure its ineligibility.Arguments before the NCLAT today remained inconclusive and hearing would resume on July 9.""Today's argument was about why ArcelorMittal believes NuMetal should be ineligible...,"" a spokesperson of ArcelorMittal told over the phone.The counsel in his argument said there is a connection between all three and Section 29 A of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not allow connected parties to bid for any stresses asset, the person said.The NCLAT had on May 22 ordered status quo on insolvency of Essar Steel for two months as it admitted petitions of Numetal and ArcelorMittal over the bidding eligibility.ArcelorMittal and NuMetal put in a second round of bid in April after the first round of bids were opined to be invalid due to the delinquent promoter connection.In the second round, NuMetal says it has offered over Rs 37,000 crore for Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal is, however, opposed the opening of the second round of bids and sought only the first round of bids to be considered.In the second round of bidding, mining baron Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources joined the race.

2018-10-28,"Ruia-family owned Essar Group would deleverage about Rs 1.25 lakh crore of debt - the largest by any corporate - if its offer to repay lenders of Essar Steel in full is accepted, company sources said. Last week, the Committee of Essar Steel Creditors picked world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal's Rs 42,000 crore takeover offer over the company promoter's Rs 54,389 crore proposal to pay off all of the lenders' dues. Essar plans to legally challenge the decision as it believes its offer would ensure 100 per cent recovery for lenders while accepting ArcelorMittal's offer would entail a haircut, sources said.Sources said Essar Group had so far used $650 million (about Rs 4,200 crore) from the sale of Aegis US operations, Rs 72,000 crore from sale of Essar Oil to Russia's Rosneft and partners, Rs 2,000 crore from sale of Aegis and Rs 2,400 crore from sale of Equinox to deleverage group debt. If the offer for Essar Steel is accepted, the deleveraging would total to Rs 1.25 lakh crore, they said. This is over 85 per cent of total group liabilities.Essar invested Rs 1.2 lakh crore -- the highest by any corporate in recent times -- between 2010 and 2015 in building world-class assets in energy, infrastructure, metals and mining, and services sector. With the completion of its investment and deleveraging programmes, Essar is growing its substantial portfolio of businesses, sources said, adding revenues of Essar portfolio companies presently stand at Rs 80,000 crore.Essar, they said, is a leaner, smarter and wiser corporate with a lighter balance sheet. Insisting that banks that lent to Essar did not lose money, they said loans are being serviced and more than Rs 20,000 crore has been paid to Essar Steel lenders by way of interest. The quality of assets created by Essar is attracting aggressive bids from high profile players and will help banks recover their dues without a haircut, they said. For better management of its portfolio of businesses, Essar has transitioned to a fund-led structure, investing long-term capital into the portfolio companies and holds 100 per cent stake (largest equity holding among peers) in all its investments.Sources said Essar has brought global investors who have infused over $32 billion in FDI demonstrating the quality of assets it builds and the quality of management they have. These include stake sale in Vodafone-Essar ($18 billion of value created), stake sale in Aegis in two tranches ($910 million of value created), stake sale of Essar Oil ($12.9 billion of value created) and stake sale of Essar Telecom Tower Ltd ($360 million of value created).Sources insisted that in each of these cases, the group exited at the right time, on its own terms, at globally compelling valuations.Essar Group, they said, has invested upwards of Rs 200,000 crore (of which Rs 120,000 crore was invested in 2010-16) in setting up world-class facilities in steel, power, ports and oil and gas. The assets included 10 million tonnes of integrated steelmaking facility, 20 million tonnes of refining capacity and 3,500-strong petrol pump network (which is now owned by the Nayara Energy), 4,800 MW of power capacity as well as a 465-km transmission network and over 150 million tonnes of ports capacity.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/essar-to-deleverage-rs-1.25-lakh-cr-debt-if-its-offer-for-essar-steel-is-accepted/story/286806.html
2018-05-16,"ArcelorMittal has just upped the ante in the battle for Essar Steel. According to a source in the know, the world's largest steel maker transferred Rs 7,000 crore in an escrow account of State Bank of India (SBI) yesterday to clear the debt of two companies it previously held stakes in - Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron. Last week, Essar Steel's Committee of Creditors (CoC) told both suitors, ArcelorMittal and Numetal, that their bids would only be considered if they repaid all pending dues owed by people/entities connected to them within a week. Furthermore, last month the NCLT had ordered the resolution professional (RP) and the CoC to reconsider the bids submitted by both parties in the first round of bidding back in February. At that time, Rewant Ruia, son of Essar Steel's promoter Ravi Ruia, had held a minority stake in Russia's VTB Capital-backed Numetal.According to The Economic Times, the overdues of ArcelorMittal was pegged at Rs 7,000 crore while that of Numetal was expected to be around Rs 40,000 crore. ArcelorMittal parked the funds with SBI just a day ahead of the deadline. The development comes days after Brian Aranha, executive vice-president (strategy, technology, R&D) at ArcelorMittal asserted that its bid for debt-laden Essar Steel is ""eligible"" and indicated that any pay off towards outstanding dues of Uttam Galva would be a ""goodwill gesture"". He had added that ArcelorMittal had initiated the declassification process as Uttam Galva's promoter before submitting bid for Essar Steel - clause 29A of the IBC prevents promoters of defaulting companies from bidding for stressed assets - but due to administrative delay, the declassification came after the bid submission.When contacted, ArcelorMittal refused to comment on transferring of about Rs 7,000 crore but said: ""Any offer to pay any outstanding loans of companies where we only had a passive stake with no management or governance role, would be made without prejudice to demonstrate the seriousness of our commitment to India and Essar Steel India Ltd (ESIL)."" The company added that they continue to believe that ""a swift resolution"" is in the best interest of Essar Steel, its stakeholders and employees.According to Mint, Numetal on Tuesday said it has informed the CoC that it is a fully eligible resolution applicant as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. ""Neither Numetal nor its shareholders have any loans overdue with any creditors in India. Aurora, which had minority shareholder interest with 25 per cent equity in Numetal, neither had management role nor any right to directorship in the company. Neither Aurora nor its beneficiary has any loan irregularities with Indian lenders and banks,"" said Numetal, adding, ""In any event, Numetal and other shareholders have already bought out Aurora's shareholding in the company.""  In order to be considered eligible to bid for Essar Steel, Numetal had roped in JSW Steel in the second round of bidding, which the NCLT disqualified. Numetal had first moved NCLT on March 20, pre-empting the NCLT decision to disqualify its original bid due to the connection with the Ruias. On March 28, its counsel Mukul Rohatgi had reportedly further requested that the resubmission of bids be deferred till the eligibility matter was heard on merits. ""We welcome the NCLT order returning the matter back to the creditors for reconsidering our original bid. We have put forth a very compelling resolution plan both industrially and financially. We hope our proposal will be considered by the CoC with a fair and holistic view,"" a Numetal spokesperson said in a statement last month. It's making quite a U-turn now. On May 10, Numetal reportedly moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) arguing for the second bid to be considered. This matter is scheduled to be heard tomorrow.Meanwhile the clock is ticking down to the May 20 deadline for insolvency resolution as per the IBC, which was previously pushed back from April 29 on account of the litigation drama.With PTI inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/arcelormittal-essar-steel-insolvency-dues-sbi-uttam-galva/story/277031.html

2018-10-28,"Enthused by the impact of new insolvency and bankruptcy law, the government expects bad loan recoveries to exceed Rs 1.80 lakh crore target for the current financial year, an official said. Some big accounts are in the process of getting resolved while some more are lined up for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), a senior Finance Ministry official told PTI. ""Going by the success rate, we hope that the recovery would exceed our own target of Rs 1.80 lakh crore through the IBC and other means,"" the official said citing some of the ongoing resolution of Essar Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. Banks hopes to write back more than Rs 1 lakh crore alone from the resolution of 12 NPA cases referred to insolvency proceedings by the RBI in its first list. Banks recovered Rs 36,551 crore in the first quarter of 2018-19. During 2017-18, banks recovered Rs 74,562 crore. Satisfied with the progress of IBC, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said ""now people have become broadly aware that the rules of the game in India have changed. The banks won't chase you anymore, you will have to chase them."" As a result of this, recoveries have picked up, he had said, adding, recoveries are not just because resolutions have taken place in the NCLT but they have also picked up because of fear that if they cross redline they will be condemned to IBC process. ""The unintended consequence was that potential defaulters started realising that the moment you cross the redline, at least you will go out, and never get back. And if you have seen the last quarter or two, potential defaulters are begging, borrowing and stealing and paying back. And that's why the banks have started getting monies even outside the NCLT system from potential defaulters not wanting to cross the redline,"" he had said. From the first list, two big cases Essar Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd are at the final stages of resolution, while Binani Cement and Jaypee Infratech are also under the process. Lenders are expecting to recover almost 86 per cent of the Rs 49,000 crore loan in case of Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal has agreed to pay a total of Rs 50,000 crore, including a Rs 8,000 crore capital infusion, to acquire the firm. In the initial round of bidding, Bhushan Power and Steel had got bids of Rs 11,000 crore from JSW Steel, Rs 17,000 crore from Tata Steel and Rs 18,500 crore from Liberty House. JSW Steel had subsequently revised its bid to Rs 19,700 crore.

2018-06-12,"The past two quarters have not been easy on the State Bank of India. In February, it had reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years, if not more, and in Q4, its net loss had tripled to Rs 7,718 crore.But the country's largest lender is a lot more optimistic about this fiscal year. According to The Economic Times, SBI is aiming to recover Rs 50,000 crore this year and is strengthening its recovery team for better collections.Of this amount, SBI hopes to recover around Rs 30,000 crore just from the cases with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). According to Pallav Mohapatra, Deputy Managing Director of Stressed Assets Resolution Group at SBI, the bank's total exposure to the two lists of stressed assets referred for resolution by the RBI last year stands at around Rs 78,000 crore. The report added that its provision coverage ratio on the first set of 12 NCLT accounts is reportedly 56 per cent, and 75 per cent for the second list. So far, the bank had filed 250 cases under IBC with a total exposure of Rs 95,000 crore.In its analyst presentation for FY2018 results, SBI had said that its expected haircut on the first list of stressed assets is 52 per cent and it is optimistic that a bulk of the resolutions will go through in the first half of the current fiscal. But it's slow going, so far, on the NCLT front since most of the cases have been largely trapped in legal hurdles, although the recoveries have been decent. The bank was able to recover Rs 8,500 crore from the Bhushan Steel-Tata Steel deal, taking a haircut of 30 per cent. It expects to recover Rs 6,000 crore from the Electrosteel-Vedanta deal. The bank expects the second NCLT list to be resolved by the end of this fiscal and anticipates roughly 25 per cent recovery from it.""The guidance has been given to our teams, now the entire system is geared towards making the recovery possible,"" Mohapatra told the daily. ""We will be using a variety of tools ranging from taking some of these accounts to NCLT, selling bad loans to asset reconstruction companies, one-time settlement with promoters and specific camps for retail borrowers who haven't paid up on time.""SBI also told the daily that it will be much more aggressive in dealing with restructuring cases in the future. ""If a fresh restructuring is done, banks have to look at what is the skin in the game for the promoters and if the current management is not capable of handling stress situations, then the bank will find a new management to run the company,"" said Mohapatra.The bank expects to get back around Rs 10,000 crore from one-time settlement, sale to ARCs et al.With PTI inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/banks/sbi-recover-rs-50000-cr-2018-fiscal/story/278995.html

2018-11-18,"JSW Steel plans to pump in over Rs 5,000 crore to strengthen its downstream manufacturing capacity and is also keen to pursue stressed downstream assets that will come up for bidding in the next round.JSW Steel, which announced a capex investment programme of nearly Rs 45,000 crore to expand its capacities in Karnataka and Maharastra, is planning to invest over Rs 5,000 crore to strengthen its downstream manufacturing capabilities, company's Joint MD Seshagiri Rao told PTI.This will enable the company to re-orient its product mix and focus on high-value special steel products and customisation, he said.""As part of its effort to ramp up downstream capabilities, JSW Steel will also pursue stressed downstream steel assets that will come up for bidding in the next round,"" he added.""The next set of assets is either downstream or very small capacities. So, if it makes sense to our downstream integration strategy. We will evaluate the asset and pursue,"" Rao said.The investment in downstream capabilities by JSW Steel is aimed at capitalising the incremental demand expected to be generated across sectors for specialised steel. While 300 million tonnes (MT) of steel consumption is expected to come in, the steel intensity across applications is coming down.""This is where the demand for very high-value steel products is rising. Circular economy is becoming very active,"" Rao said.Jayant Acharya, Director Commercial - Marketing and Strategy, JSW Steel, said, the company will ""reduce focus in commodity space and enter into alloy steel and special steel space to make the business more sustainable in the long term. Our aim is to look at more and more de-competitive business segment as a key indicator of focusing more on special steel categories"".As part of its long-term play, the company is deprioritising its focus on commodity steel space.According to Rao, while overall capacity of JSW Steel will grow by 40 per cent over the next three years, the downstream capacity will increase by 60 per cent, colour coated capacity will go up by 140 per cent and tinplate capacity will increase six-fold.The company expects special steel products to contribute 40 per cent of its future volumes while customisation products will add the rest 60 per cent.""We are not going to produce commodity. Basis our very customised steel portfolio and high-end value-added product mix, the business will become less volatile,"" Rao said. JSW Steel believes that it is unperturbed about new competition from global steel players.""We think there is enough space for growth and healthy competition is good. If you look at competition earlier, certain companies which were stressed were at times forced to sell materials at lower prices to generate cash flows whereas with healthy competitors that problem will be eliminated to some extent,"" Acharya said. The company said that it sees the Indian steel landscape becoming more mature from a competition perspective. ""We see our growth potential with respect to India across short, medium and long-term. I don't think we need to worry about the competitive landscape,"" he added.",https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/jsw-steel-to-invest-rs-5000-crore-to-boost-manufacturing/story/292248.html
2018-10-19,"India has imposed anti-dumping duties of up to $185.51 per tonne for five years on certain varieties of Chinese steel to guard domestic players from cheap imports from the neighbouring country.The revenue department imposed the duty based on recommendations of the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), according to a government notification.JSW Steel Ltd, Sunflag Iron & Steel Co, Usha Martin, Gerdau Steel India, Vardhman Special Steels and Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd had jointly filed an application before DGTR for initiation of investigations and levying of anti-dumping duties on some steel products.In its anti-dumping investigation, the DGTR stated that dumped imports of 'straight length bars and rods of alloy steel' from China have increased in absolute terms during the period of probe (2016-17). While recommending the anti-dumping duty, DGTR said the goods have been exported to India from the China below normal value and the domestic industry has suffered material injury on account of the imports. The duty has been imposed in the range of $44.89 to $185.51 per tonne on import of 'Alloy bars and rods in straight length, whether or not hot rolled, hot drawn, cold drawn, cold extruded, peeled bar, surface machined, polished, bright bar, forged'.""The anti-dumping duty... shall be effective for a period of five years (unless revoked, superseded or amended earlier) from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette and shall be paid in Indian currency,"" the notification said. The product finds end use application across various segments and sectors including forging, automobiles, auto components, crank shaft, springs, gears, fasteners, cement plants, power plants, turbines, ship-building, and railways, among others. Imports of straight length bars and rods of alloy steel from China have increased to 1,80,959 tonnes in 2016-17 from 56,690 tonnes in 2013-14. India's total imports rose to 2,56,004 tonnes in 2016-17 from 1,32,933 tonnes in 2013-14. The demand of this steel in India too increased to 16,69,653 tonnes in 2016-17 from 15,14,795 tonnes in 2013-14. Domestic steel manufacturers always flag concerns over the imports from the neighbouring country, with which India has a huge trade deficit. The trade gap with China has increased to $63.12 billion in 2017-18 from $51.11 billion in the previous financial year.In general, the purpose of anti-dumpinmg duty is to eliminate injury caused to the domestic industry by the unfair trade practices of dumping so as to re-establish a situation of open and fair competition in the Indian market, which is in interest of the country.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/govt-imposes-anti-dumping-duty-on-certain-steel-products-from-china/story/285789.html
2018-02-07,"It was assumed all along that Essar group director Prashant Ruia's frequent trips to Moscow would conclude with the sale of Essar's oil refinery business to Russian oil giant Rosneft. But there is more to it than meets the eye. The Moscow visits seem unlikely to end soon since the Ruias are now working towards forming a consortium with Russian bank VTB and Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management to regain control of the debt-laden Essar Steel, put up for sale under the bankruptcy law. Essar Steel has over `43,000 crore of debt on its books.As things stand, VTB and SSG are expected to contribute the lions share of the funds required for the bid while the Ruias would most likely be minority shareholders in the consortium, say media reports. The move by the Ruias has captured the attention of the corporate world since it comes after the government amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to prevent promoters of loan defaulting companies from regaining control without settling the overdue amount. It is clear that the Essar promoters will have to pay overdues, estimated to be between `6,000 crore and `7,000 crore - this includes interest and charges relating to non-performing asset accounts before the submission of the resolution plan. The deadline to submit bids for Essar Steel has been extended to February 12 from end-January after potential bidders sought more time to finalise their deal structure and funding arrangements.A Crowded RaceAccording to sources in the committee of creditors (CoC), which include banks that lent to Essar Steel, the Ruias want to win back their steel asset. ""But they don't want to pay `7,000 crore only for qualifying. They are ready to make the payment if they get back the asset,"" says a banker. There is no guarantee the Ruias can win back the company as they will have to battle it out with the world's largest steelmaker, ArcelorMittal, which has joined hands with Japanese giant Nippon for the bid. Others in the race are Anil Agarwal's Vedanta and Tata Steel.""The Ruias, however, do not see Vedanta and Tata Steel as strong contenders. Their interest is in taking over the asset at a cheap valuation and without the debt of over `25,000 crore,"" says a Mumbai-based investment banker. In addition, he says, they themselves are weighed down under a debt-burden. Tata Steel has a gross debt of `90,000 crore, taken mostly for the Corus acquisition. Vedanta had a gross debt of `55,218 crore as on December 31, 2017, though at the net level, it's only `16,295 crore because of the cash reserves of the recently merged Cairn India and the subsidiary Hindustan Zinc.The OpportunityThe big challenge before the Ruias is the ArcelorMittal-Nippon combine. {mosimage}Both companies are looking for a footprint in the `3.15 lakh crore Indian steel market. It becomes all the more attractive as steel prices have shot up 15 per cent in the past seven to eight months. At the present demand growth rate of 8-10 per cent a year, there will be a need for additional capacity in India by 2021.But there are no big plans for capacity creation given the high debt levels of steel companies and the prevailing high interests in the country. ArcelorMittal and Nippon see this as an opportunity, say sources.The big question is whether the combine will quote a sizable debt takeover. According to the restructuring plan submitted to its lenders by the Ruias last year (before Essar Steel was taken to the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, by the lenders), banks were offered 30-35 per cent stake in the company and seats on the board, while the Ruias planned to retain management control with a 40 per cent stake. For diluting their stake in favour of banks, the Ruias sought about `10,000 crore to be converted into long-dated securities redeemable at a later date, extension of the loan repayment period to 20 years and an average interest rate cut of 2 per cent.The plan of the promoters still looks attractive for banks while the other prospective bidders are looking for a 50 per cent hair-cut.Essar Steel's 10 million tonnes (MT) steel production facility in Hazira, Gujarat, is operating at around 80 per cent capacity after the rise in demand, says a company official. ""The resolution team claims a turnaround of the plant after they took over. But the fact is that the earlier management was paying around `250 crore every month for servicing the debt when the plant was running at 60 per cent capacity. After the resolution professional came in, the company stopped repayments as part of the insolvency proceedings. That improved the cash flow and the company turned profitable,"" he adds. The liquidation value of Essar steel is estimated at `22,000 crore.The Ruia GameplanIf the Ruias do get a chance to bid, they will put forth an irresistible offer to the CoC, say the bankers. If they are not allowed, the Ruias will have to front outsiders to bid for the company or challenge the IBC in the higher courts. Videocon Industries has reportedly filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court seeking a stay on NCLT proceedings initiated against it by banks. After the prodding by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the IBC. Videocon Industries is the second company after Jayaswal Neco to challenge the RBI's decision. Even if the Ruias successfully rope in outsiders, there is no guarantee that the family can take over Essar Steel in future as steel industry valuations are already on rising. If the Ruias do manage to regain control over Essar Steel, the entire process under IBC will be questioned. The Singhal family, promoters of Bhushan Steel, is keenly watching the Ruias since they are also hoping to follow suit. The potential bidders for Bhushan Steel, which has a liquidation value fixed at `15,000 crore, includes JSW Steel, Vedanta and Tata Steel. With promoters of debt-laden steel companies looking to regain control, it's definitely going to be interesting times ahead.A number of steel companies are takeover targets under the new insolvency guidelines. JSW Steel has submitted a `3,700 crore worth resolution plan for Monnet Ispat. The liquidation value for the company was `2,385 crore. Vedanta submitted the highest bid of `4,500 crore for Electrosteel Steels. However, Tata Steel, which submitted a `3,500 crore bid has asked for a rebid citing lack of clarity on taxes during the time of bid submission.  @nevinjl",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-hub/bidding-to-win/story/269873.html
2018-01-17,"Japanese steel and engineering companies are in the driver's seat to bag major supply contracts for a $17 billion Indian bullet train, several sources said, undermining a key component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic policy - a push to 'Make in India'. Japan is funding most of the project, and Japanese companies are likely to supply at least 70 percent of the core components of the rail line, said five sources in New Delhi with direct knowledge of the matter.A spokesman for Modi's office declined comment.A Japanese transport ministry official involved in the project said the two countries were still working out a strategy for the supply of key components, and would unveil a plan for procurements around July. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.The September 2017 agreement between Japan and India for the bullet train project included two clauses - the promotion of 'Make in India' and 'Transfer of Technology' - through which New Delhi had hoped to set up manufacturing facilities in the country, generate jobs and get a toehold in Japanese technology.Modi faces a general election in 2019 and is under pressure to provide more jobs to millions of unemployed in India. Critics also say the bullet train is wasteful and that the money could be better used elsewhere.""The Japanese have reservations on certain issues because they have a concern that there is a difference in the culture and systems of Japan from the culture and systems in India,"" said Achal Khare, the managing director of National High Speed Rail Corp Ltd (NHSRCL), the agency tasked to execute the bullet train project.""The work culture is very different,"" he told Reuters.Khare did not elaborate but two Indian railways officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said their Japanese counterparts had raised questions about efficiency in Indian companies and their ability to meet timelines.The World Bank currently ranks India 100th out of 190 nations on the ease of doing business, giving it relatively low marks for starting a business, enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits.Tomoyuki Nakano, director for international engineering affairs in the railway bureau at Japan's transport ministry, said the issue was that Indian companies had no experience or technologies specialising in high-speed railway systems at present.""I don't think Japanese are concerned about a difference in the work culture,"" Nakano said. He and other Japanese officials said efforts were continuing to fulfil the 'Make in India' component of the agreement by promoting collaborations between companies from the two countries.Still, several Indian officials said it was by and large accepted that Indian companies would not have a major part to play in the bullet train project.Japan will get major leeway because the bullet train is largely funded by a 50-year loan provided by its government, said a close aide of Modi, who spoke on condition of anonymity.""At this stage to expect Indian companies to have a bigger share in manufacturing appears to be a little difficult,"" said a senior official at the Indian government's policy think-tank, NITI Aayog, who is involved in the negotiations.Modi's flagship 'Make in India' initiative aims to lift the share of manufacturing in India's $2 trillion economy to 25 percent and create 100 million jobs by 2022.However, midway through Modi's five-year term, manufacturing was still at 17 percent of India's GDP in the 2016/17 financial year from 15 percent previously.ONLY ONE JOINT VENTUREJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for India's first bullet train in September last year. It will link Mumbai with Ahmedabad, the largest commercial city in Modi's home state Gujarat.Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, Japan's biggest steelmaker, and other companies like JFE Holdings Inc, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd are likely to bid for various contracts, said three senior Indian government officials directly involved in the project.Nippon Steel said it would not comment on specific projects.JFE, Hitachi and Toshiba said they were interested in the project but had not finalised plans, including any possibilities of joint ventures with Indian firms.Mitsubishi Heavy said it had not decided if it wanted to be involved. The sole collaboration aimed at the bullet train project is between Kawasaki Heavy Industries and India's Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, which aims to win carriage orders.Japanese government officials have asked for more bullet train corridors in India before transferring technology, three senior Indian officials said.But New Delhi is unlikely to announce any new projects until the final cost and commercial feasibility of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad link is clear, the officials said.""It's like a chicken and egg situation on technology. The Japanese want an economy of scale and business but the Indian view is that India is a big market that once this market is explored the business will automatically be generated,"" said Khare from NHSRCL.MISSED OPPORTUNITYNew Delhi has tried to help Indian steel companies grab a slice of the pie. The Indian government last year mediated negotiations between Nippon Steel and India's Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JNSP.NS) to set up a joint venture to manufacture rails, but the talks fell through after the Japanese major raised quality concerns, three sources in New Delhi said.State-owned Steel Authority of India (SAIL), which for decades has been the main supplier of rails to Indian Railways, was also overlooked by Japanese companies due to quality concerns, the sources said.Nippon Steel declined comment and while Jindal and SAIL did not reply to e-mails seeking comment.Left with little choice, Indian firms will now largely provide raw materials like cement and supply manpower for the assembly of rails, the sources said.India's UltraTech Cement Ltd, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd are among those in the race for the supply of construction materials and power, the two Indian railways officials said. These companies did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/bullet-train-project-make-in-india-japan-contracts-shinzo-abe/story/268302.html
2018-06-15,"A year after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) first directed commercial banks to invoke immediate bankruptcy proceedings against 12 big corporate defaulters, the insolvency resolution in many of the large firms is still mired in legal tangles. Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the sale process has been almost completed in three cases--- Bhushan Steel, Electrosteel Steels, Monnet Ispat and Energy. There is less clarity in the other cases when the 270 day timeframe for resolution ends around now. Electrosteel Steels Metal and mining giant Vedanta has acquired the management control of debt-laden Electrosteel Steels. ABG Shipyard The company has received a new resolution plan from a prospective bidder, pursuant to a fresh bid process initiated through an of advertisement on April 18. The said resolution plan was opened at a creditors' meeting on May 18. Earlier, the resolution professional rejected the only bid received from UK-based Liberty House citing its lower than the liquidation value of the firm. In addition, there were questions raised on the eligibility of Liberty House under Section 29(A) of the IBC as the company owed $2.8 million dues to Exim Bank. The deadline for the completion of the resolution process expired on April 28. Amtek Auto The Chandigarh bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), last week, reserved its order on whether Liberty House was eligible to bid for the bankrupt auto-component firm, Amtek Auto. The auto component maker was admitted for insolvency in July 2017, and the Deccan Value and Liberty were the two bidders for its assets. Liberty emerged as the highest bidder. Jyoti Structures  The lenders have chosen a clutch of high networth individuals led by Sharad Sanghi, the chief of Netmagic Solutions, to revive the bankrupt EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) company Jyoti Structures. They are the sole bidder, offering just about Rs 3,000 crore to lenders over a period of 15 years while infusing equity capital in the range of Rs 150 to Rs 170 crore. However, the reports say that the legal representatives of IndusInd Bank and DBS Bank have filed applications with the NCLT in Mumbai, opposing the current resolution plan. Essar Steel The appellate tribunal, NCLAT, had on May 22 ordered status quo on insolvency of Essar Steel for two months as it admitted petitions of NuMetal and ArcelorMittal over the bidding eligibility. The resolution professional had disqualified ArcelorMittal since they had ownership interests in bankrupt companies Uttam Galva and KSS Pteron. Numetal was a consortium formed by Russian bank VTB and a trust controlled by the estranged promoter of Essar Steel, Rewant Ruia. In the second round of bid, Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources has also submitted a resolution plan, while Numetal consortium severed ties with Ruia and joined hands with JSW Steel and submitted an offer of Rs 37,000 crore, which is Rs 2,000 crore higher than the offer made by ArcelorMittal in the first round. Jaypee Infratech The 270-day deadline to find a resolution in real estate developer Jaypee had lapsed on May 12. According to IBC, a company has to be sent for liquidation if no solution found. But liquidation is not a favourable option in this case since thousands of homebuyers deposited their money with the company to buy flats. The court had on May 16 asked the promoters Gaur family to deposit Rs 1,000 crore with the registrar of the company but they failed to do so. The company had deposited Rs 750 crore earlier. For beleaguered Jaypee Infratech, the resolution plan was submitted by multiple bidders, including Sudhir Valia of Suraksha Asset Reconstruction Company and Adani Group. The offers range between Rs 7,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore. However, Jaiprakash Associates, the promoter company of Jaypee Infra, approached Supreme Court complaining that the company was undervalued and the original valuation would come to around Rs 16,000 crore. Besides, it submitted another revival plan of Rs 10,000 crore under which the promoters promised to deliver the 18,000-19,000 flats to the company's homebuyers in three years. Bhushan Steel Tata Steel, which had won the bid for Bhushan Steel under the insolvency process, had completed the acquisition of a controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in the debt-laden firm on May 18. Monnet Ispat and Energy The consortium led by Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel and AION Capital has received the letter of intent for acquiring the stressed asset of Monnet Ispat and Energy. They were the only bidder. The media reported that JSW-AION submitted a Rs 3,750 crore bid for the steelmaker. Alok Industries Alok's lenders had rejected the joint bid by Reliance Industries and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company in April. However, the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT recently asked the company's lenders to reconsider the only resolution plan of Reliance-JM. The joint bidders offered Rs 5,000 crore against close to Rs 30,000 crore in dues to creditors. Lenders rejected this resolution plan, putting the company at risk of liquidation. However, some of the company's operational creditors and employees opposed this and approached the NCLT. Bhushan Power and Steel The company, which owes more than Rs 47,000 crore to its bankers, received bids from Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Liberty House. Earlier reports said that Tata Steel is the highest bidder with Rs 24,500 crore offer, but reports say that Liberty House has submitted an offer slightly higher than Tatas'. However, the lenders are not confident of the funding plans of Liberty House. But it is also not clear whether Tatas, which already bagged Bhushan Steel, would go for one more big take over. Lanco Infratech The Hyderabad-based infrastructure company is on the brink of liquidation. However, the NCLT received a petition from Thriveni Earthmovers recently for considering its revised resolution plan after the 270-day deadline. While the first bid of Thriveni, filed in the stipulated period, was rejected by the lenders. NCLT will hear the matter after the summer vacation.Binani Cement Dalmia Bharat, declared winner is the first round of bid for Binani Cement, declined to raise its offer of Rs 6,582 crore in the second round. But UltraTech Cement submitted Rs 7,600 crore resolution plan in the second round. Dalmia approached the Supreme Court to stay the resolution process, but the apex court rejected the appeal. The court will hear the matter in July. UltraTech has offered to pay the lenders their due only 5 days after the receipt of the order in their favour. Ruchi SoyaThe joint venture Adani Wilmar had submitted a Rs 5,474 crore resolution plan for Ruchi Soya while Patanjali Ayurved had offered Rs 5,765 crore. However, Adani Wilmar allocated Rs 4,300 crore toward repaying lenders against Rs 4,065 crore repayment plan of Patanjali. Reports say that Adani-Wilmar has decided not to revise its bid.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/sale-of-bankrupt-companies-stuck-in-litigations/story/279224.html
2018-09-19,"As the sale of Essar Steel under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, or IBC, moves a step closer, its past owner, the Ruia family, is coming to terms with the fact that re-building its business empire to the scale it enjoyed just five years ago might take decades. At its peak, the group, promoted by brothers Shashi Ruia and Ravi Ruia, and at present run by Shashi's son Prashant Ruia, had interests in half-a-dozen sectors - oil refining, power, steel, ports, telecom and BPO, in India and abroad. In 2014/15, it was among the top five business houses in India with revenues of Rs1.6 lakh crore. It had also run up a debt of Rs1.3 lakh crore.After the IBC process is over, the Ruias would have lost not only their crown jewel, Essar Steel (Rs20,000 crore revenue in the last financial year), but also a number of power and port assets that lenders are referring to the National Companies Law Tribunal or NCLT. They will still own some companies but the group will be less than one-third the size it was five years ago.The Ruias did everything possible to hold on to Essar Steel. In 2016, they sold their Vadinar oil refinery, a captive power plant and a port for $12.9 billion to pay off some group-level debt. They even tried to bid for Essar Steel when it was offered for sale under the IBC. But the government changed the IBC rules and barred promoters from bidding unless they paid banks the entire money owed by them.The only consolation is that even after losing Essar Steel, the Ruias would control several companies with combined revenues of over $7 billion, thanks to the Stanlow refinery in the UK. Several others who had built their business empires using cheap debt during the go-go years of the economy in the last decade would consider them lucky. They, after all, are losing almost everythingthey ran.ESSAR STEEL INDIA Shashi Ruia, 75, & Ravi Ruia, 69The warring Singal brothers - Sanjay and his younger sibling Neeraj - in race to build bigger and more modern steel factories have lost their companies. Neeraj's Bhushan Steel has been snapped up by Tata Steel, while JSW Steel and Tata Steel are fighting for Sanjay's Bhushan Power and Steel. The Singals will have no significant business left after this.The Gaur family of the Jaypee group will also lose most of their assets. They started off as government contractors for big dams such as Sardar Sarovar and Tehri. But after the IBC process is over, they would have lost almost all their businesses - cement, power, real estate and infrastructure. The most profitable cement plants have already been sold to clear some debt. The real estate business is facing bankruptcy, and after its sale/liquidation, the Gaurs will probably have a handful of relatively smaller assets, if anything.BHUSHAN STEEL BHUSHAN POWER & STEEL, Sanjay Singal, 61,They have company in Sandip Jajodia (the brother-in-law of JSW Group's Sajjan Jindal), who built the Monnet Ispat group; Arvind Dham, who created an auto ancillary empire under Amtek Auto; and Rishi Agarwal of ABG Shipyards. Then there are Valecha, Thakur and Mirchandani families, all partners in Jyoti Structures, which is facing liquidation.BHUSHAN STEEL BHUSHAN POWER & STEEL Neeraj Singal, 50These companies are among the 12 big loan default cases which lenders had taken to the NCLT for resolution in the first round. In the next rounds, many other big names will also have to get used to a far smaller presence. The Videocon empire, for instance, will shrink to a handful of small businesses (including hydrocarbon assets abroad), as would several others, such as Ruchi Soya, built by the Indore-based Shahra family.These businessmen were ambitious. They used cheap debt to expand to unsustainable levels. And most made miscalculations in projections for the future. Their rise, and the subsequent fall, is a tale of how ambition is all it takes to build a fortune, and destroy it too. And though some may bounce back, most would never find a place on the Indian corporate world's high table.The Ruias - Rise and FallFor decades, it seemed the Ruias had been blessed with the nine lives of a cat as they survived one business mishap after another. Brothers Shashi and Ravi had started out as infrastructure contractors in 1969, building ports and pipelines, before getting into the core businesses themselves - steel, telecom, ports, refinery and power. But their problem has been, and still remains, over-dependence on debt. Essar Steel's first loan default, for example, was in 2000. That was not the only one. It had to file for bankruptcy protection for two separate group companies in the US, defaulted on power and refinery loans, among others, and had to seek debt restructuring several times. Each time, they managed to come out of the debt trap by selling smaller assets. Still, by March 2017, the group debt was Rs1.3 lakh crore.Their other problem has been execution. Both the Vadinar refinery and Essar Steel's plant were delayed several times. The Ruias, when they last met BT, said the reasons were not under their control. Prashant Ruia, for example, said Essar Steel's problems were compounded by the fact that it did not get gas as promised by the government and so could not run at full steam. This, coupled with a global downturn in steel prices and dumping from China, made the business unviable. The Vadinar refinery was delayed due to several reasons, including a hurricane.However, this time, even after selling several assets, the Ruias have not been able to retain their steel business. Between 2011 and now, they have sold their 33 per cent stake in Vodafone for Rs22,350 crore, BPO unit Aegis for $910 million, and the prized Vadinar refinery. They have sought bankruptcy protection for steel and mining business in Algoma and Minnesota in the US and are close to losing Essar Steel, Essar Projects (renamed as EPC Constructions India), Essar Power Jharkhand and Essar Bulk Terminal Salaya, besides Essar Steel.After losing all this, the Ruias will have enough businesses - a nine-million-tonne refinery in the UK, a few power plants, ports, and some shipping vessels. The flip side is the enormous debt - the debt in the remaining business is estimated to be Rs30,000 crore.The Singal Saga - Losing a FortuneThe Singal family - father Brij Bhushan and sons Sanjay and Neeraj - built up a sizeable steel empire in the 90s. Brij Bhushan had started out in the 1970s with a small unit for door hinges and rail track fasteners. The family moved up when it took over Jawahar Metal Industries Private Ltd in 1987 and got into cold rolled steel strips and ingots. Jawahar Metal was renamed Bhushan Steel and Strips in 1992, got listed in 1993, and went on an expansion binge. All under the radar.It was only in early 2000 that the Singals hit headlines and that too after a family fight. Brij Bhushan Singal, who had expanded the group with the help of his sons, claimed that as per an oral family agreement, he would continue to hold one-third promoter stake in both group companies - Bhushan Steel or BSL (run by Neeraj) and Bhushan Power and Steel or BPSL (run by Sanjay). Sanjay got his father expelled from the company. Bhushan and Neeraj ended up on one side. In 2011, the Singals split the empire - the unlisted BPSL went to Sanjay and the listed BSL to Brij Bhushan and Neeraj.The brothers entered into a race for capacity creation and went for frenetic expansion in Odisha. Their quest for coal and ore took them as far as Australia. BSL's debt rose from Rs11,400 crore in March 2010 to Rs48,000 crore at the end of March 2017. BPSL's debt rose from Rs17,900 crore in March 2012 to Rs38,000 crore by March 2017. Just before defaulting, the two brothers had a combined capacity of 9.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) - 5.6 MT for BSL and 3.5 MT for BPSL - of steel. These were state-of-the-art plants, with technology from Hitachi and orders from some of the biggest companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors. But falling steel prices, along with high debt, did them in. BSL's 2014 annual report said the company paid around Rs1,700 crore interest and posted a Rs62 crore profit. Sources say they were close to many bankers and got loans easily. Despite the clear weakness on the balance sheet, in 2014, banks had extended it fresh loans of almost Rs18,000 crore.JAYPEE INFRATECH & JAIPRAKASH ASSOCIATES Jaiprakash Gaur, 81 and Manoj Gaur (in pic), 54Debt was just one issue. In November 2013, BSL had to shut down a blast furnace in Odisha after an explosion in the slag pit during a trial run killed three workers and left at least 14 severely injured. The plant was sealed for five months. In 2014, Neeraj was arrested by the CBI for allegedly bribing Syndicate Bank Chairman S.K. Jain for extending the companys credit limit. A few days before Neeraj's arrest, the Chief Financial Officer of BPSL, Arun Agarwal, was taken into custody. The events culminated in the Singals losing both the companies. The group doesn't have any other major business apart from this.Today, Neeraj is out on bail after the second arrest recently by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and Sanjay is maintaining a low profile. It is likely that the buyers for the two assets will rename the companies and the Bhushan empire will vanish just as fast as it had came into the limelight.Both the Singal brothers didn't respond to messages from BT.The Gaurs - How The Cookie CrumbledWhen you travel on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and then to the Yamuna Expressway to Agra, you see the sheer scale of the ambitions of the Gaur family. For kilometres on end, towers, most of them incomplete, keep you company.After IBC action against two group companies - holding firm Jaiprakash Associates, or JAL, and infrastructure arm Jaypee Infratech, is over, the Gaur empire would have shrunk to a few inconsequential pieces. They have already sold some profitable cement plants to Aditya Birla's UltraTech in a distress sale. The hydro power assets, too, have been sold. Manoj Gaur, the son of the founder, Jaiprakash Gaur, tried to cut a deal with lenders in May with a Rs10,000 crore offer for Jaypee Infratech. The proposal included paying a part of the Rs9,800 crore debt, giving lenders equity and completing unfinished housing projects. It did not go through.But how did things come to such a pass? Jaiprakash Gaur had started out as a builder of infrastructure projects. JAL, floated in 1979, made a name for itself through high-profile dam projects. Gaur also built several cement plants. Execution skills and closeness to the powers that be in Lucknow ensured that they got many big projects. After the 90s liberalisation, the Gaurs used India's big infrastructure plans to build businesses and amass land, some bought outright and others as part of infrastructure development deals.The Gaurs led a simple life. However, their aspirations soared with last decade's boom and they grabbed financially risky projects - including roads, power/cement plants, real estate and hotels, besides the Rs2,000 crore F1 track. They were close to several UP politicians. ""Jaiprakash Associates is exposed to the risk of political upheaval or exigencies in Uttar Pradesh,"" an Edelweiss report said in 2011.LANCO INFRATECH L. Madhusudhan Rao, 52Till the time the group stuck to execution of big projects and building a cement empire, it kept doing well. Its cement business was at one time among the top five in the country. The Gaurs then ventured into road building, real estate and power generation, which was when the debt started rising. The Yamuna Expressway was built without government funding. The Gaurs, in return, got the rights to develop a big chunk of land and five townships along the expressway. Meanwhile, they started building 32,000 flats on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway under Jaypee Greens and Wish Town brand names. The company had the rights to develop 6,175 acres and took possession of 3,745 acres. At the start of the development, the land was projected to fetch a value of Rs1.35 lakh crore in 20 years.But projects in Noida, Mirzapur and Agra were hit by financial constraints. Until March 2017, it had sold 52.63 million sq. ft. land for Rs18,052 crore. But working capital shortage continued, resulting in delays. Finally, the projects ground to a halt and it defaulted on loansThe Gaurs tried to sell whatever they could. Unfortunately, only good assets like hydro power projects and well-run cement factories found buyers. What was offered for the other projects, including land bank and incomplete real estate projects, was a fraction of what was required to pay off the debt. Even after paying off Rs35,000 crore loans, JAL and Jaypee Infra together had a debt burden of Rs40,000 crore in 2017, before the lenders started moves to take them to the NCLT. Another group company, Prayagraj Power Generation Company, is also up for sale. It owes around Rs11,000 crore to 17 lenders. Recently, the Jaiprakash Power Ventures board approved conversion of Rs4,000 crore debt into equity to prevent insolvency.The Supreme Court stalled NCLT proceedings against Jaypee Infra after homebuyers sought protection of their interests. But on August 9, it referred the case back to the insolvency court and asked it to start the process afresh under a new committee of creditors, or CoC, where homebuyers are represented. The court also directed the RBI to initiate similar resolution proceedings against JAL, observing that an audit had shown diversion of Rs10,000 crore from Jaypee Infratech to JAL.""JAL is undergoing a serious financial crisis,"" said a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. The court barred the promoters from bidding for the assets. In the first round of bidding for Jaypee Infra, the lenders got several offers from groups such as Adani and JSW but Lakshwadeep Investments and Finance Pvt Ltd quoted the highest price of Rs7,000 crore.What will the Jaypee group be left with after this is over? Probably some real estate and small cement and power assets, but nothing like what they had for the past two decades when the promoters regularly made it to the list of Indian billionaires in Forbes.L. Madhusudhan Rao - The FallGurugram-based energy and infrastructure major Lanco Infratech grew at a tremendous pace after liberalisation. Initial growth was driven by large contracts, primarily in construction. Later, other infrastructure areas such as power generation and transportation were added. But it was the entry of L. Madhusudhan Rao, the younger brother of former MP from Vijaywada, Lagadapati Rajagopal, as chairman of Lanco Infra in 2002 that changed the pace of expansion. Lanco bet heavily on India's power generation opportunities and emerged as the highest bidder for the country's first ultra mega power project in Sasan in 2007. But it later got disqualified due to technical incompetence.By 2010, the company increased its power generation capacity to 2,000 MW. Rao secured $1.5 billion funding for an additional 1,320 MW power plant in eastern India; floated a subsidiary in Singapore for foraying into power projects in emerging markets; partnered with Indonesian miner Bukit Asam; and pursued solar energy projects in Europe and the US. The Wayne State University graduate was the 29th richest Indian with a net worth of $2.3 billion in 2010.AMTEK AUTO Arvind Dham, 57Lanco Infra created power plants of 3,460 megawatt (MW) capacity. While going to the NCLT, close to 4,636 MW was under construction. It reported nearly Rs10,000 crore revenues in March 2015. But last three years' losses come to over Rs4,000 crore, mainly due to interest paid on the huge debt (Rs47,000 crore at the end of the 2017 financial year) and structural problems in the power sector that are affecting almost all big power producers. The government is trying to work out a solution for distressed power assets but that won't help Lanco as it is already under the IBC.Arvind Dham - Hitting the WallArvind Dham, son of a Haryana irrigation department officer, joined the family's construction business in 1985 after graduating in architecture from the University of New York at Buffalo. But his heart was not in it. He found opportunity in the automobile industry when Maruti Suzuki was looking for entrepreneurs to develop a supplier base for Maruti 800 parts. That was the beginning of Amtek Auto.It was a fairytale journey as Dham became an original equipment manufacturer to Tata Motors, Fiat and Ford India. Unsatisfied with the scale of the domestic market, he went on an overseas buying spree between 2005 and 2014, a period when he made 22 acquisitions in areas such as iron casting, metal forging and machining. This made Amtek into a large player in the global casting and forging business and gave it marquee clients such as BMW and Daimler. His rise mirrored that of another auto ancillaries player Vivek Chaand Sehgal and his flagship firm Motherson Sumi Systems. Both Dham and Sehgal shopped for assets abroad. Both built global assets. But Sehgal was running a tighter operation with debt under control. Amtek's debt got out of hand.In the domestic market, Amtek invested Rs5,000 crore to expand capacities between 2011 and 2014. Growth expectations went wrong and led to cash flow mismatch. In 2014, the business generated $2.5 billion revenue from overseas and $1.5 billion from domestic operations. In the financial year ended September 2014, it had a whopping consolidated debt of Rs17,663 crore. It first defaulted in September 2015 on its Rs800 crore bonds. After this, things went from bad to worse. By the time it was referred to the NCLT, it had a debt of Rs4,000 crore. The company posted more standalone losses than revenues in 2016/17 - it made a loss before tax of Rs2,244 crore and generated revenue of less than Rs2,000 crore. London-based Liberty House paid Rs4,334 crore for the company. Liberty's resolution plan for Amtek's subsidiary, Castex Technologies, has also been approved.VIDEOCON INDUSTRIES Venugopal Dhoot, 66After losing the two bankrupt companies, Dham will be left with Metalyst Forgings, which made a loss of Rs650 crore in the December 2017 financial year, and Italian coffee chain Barista, which is in losses and on the block. It is managed by his daughter Anamika.Venugopal Dhoot - Sinking FlagshipVideocon's Venugopal Dhoot could lose his flagship consumer durables business and end up with just oil and gas assets abroad. Videocon was India's leading brand in the 90s just after the era of Dyanora and Weston TV. Dhoot was hailed as the architect of the country's first homegrown consumer durables company. But the Koreans ousted the Indian television makers as they had lower prices, large distribution network and better technology. While Indian incumbents like BPL and Onida lost the plot, Videocon managed to survive by acquiring assets. Dhoot acquired the colour picture tube (CPT) business of Thomson SA in France in 2005. This made it the third-largest CPT maker in the world. He also took over the Philips colour television plant and three plants of Electrolux India.But Dhoot's television business took a big knock when LCD, LED and plasma TV arrived. The decision to acquire CPT plants weighed down heavily on the balance sheet. Dhoot told BT a year back that the company had lost about Rs4,000 crore in modernisation of the Gujarat CPT plant.Another misadventure was telecom. In 2008, just after Vodafone's $11 billion acquisition of Hutch, Dhoot applied for spectrum. He picked up a 64 per cent stake in Mahendra Nahata's Datacom Solutions, which had a pan-India licence to offer GSM-based mobile telephone services. But the partners fell out and the latter exited, selling his 36 per cent stake to Videocon for around Rs1,400 crore. Though Dhoot started the business, in 2012, the Supreme Court cancelled Videocon's licences after the 2G scam. The company bought spectrum for six circles in the next round of auction but failed to create a customer base. In 2016, Bharti Airtel bought its spectrum. Videocon lost around Rs7,000 crore in telecom.MONNET ISPAT Sandeep Jajodia, 52Videocon largely failed to counter cosumer durables giants such as LG and Samsung technologically. Margins have shrunk for the division - which includes televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, ACs and mobile phones - as its loss widened to Rs5,264 crore in the last financial year, compared to a peak profit of Rs855 crore .In June, the NCLT's Mumbai Bench admitted the insolvency petition after it failed to repay its Rs21,000 crore debt. Reports say the SBI-led consortium has sought permission from the RBI to postpone action against subsidiary Videocon Oil Ventures that owes Rs20,000 crore to lenders.Dhoot, whose brother Rajkumar is a Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP, also got embroiled in the Rs3,250 crore ICICI Bank loan controversy. Meanwhile, Dhoot has been charged by the Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing in another corporate fraud case in which, if convicted, he may face imprisonment for seven years. Police reports say Dhoot had sold 3 million shares of Tirupati Ceramics, which had already been sold to another person.Dinesh Shahra - Low Profile to OblivionThough not as high profile, Dinesh Shahra, the Managing Director of Indore-based Ruchi Soya Industries, which started off in 1955 as an oil trading firm, is in trouble too. Shahra founded FMCG player Ruchi Soya in 1986. Within 25 years, it was a Rs30,000 crore company and the largest marketer of edible oils, soya food, premium table spread, vanaspati and bakery fats. It is the largest edible oil extraction company with a capacity of 3.72 MTPA across 24 plants and owns popular brands Nutrela, Mahakosh, Sunrich, Ruchi Gold and Ruchi Star.Ruchi owes Rs12,000 crore to creditors. Last year, it announced a 51 per cent stake sale to private equity major Devonshire Capital for about Rs4,000 crore. However, with the NCLT admitting its case, the Devonshire deal failed to close. It is at the centre of a takeover battle between Adani Wilmar and Patanjali Ayurved. The creditors approved Adani Wilmar's Rs6,000 crore resolution plan but Patanjali moved the NCLT seeking disqualification of Adani.BINANI CEMENT Braj Binani, 58Braj Binani - A Crumbling EmpireAnother case is that of Braj Binani, a fifth generation entrepreneur who diversified into cement, fibreglass, infrastructure/construction, zinc and energy. He built cement plants in China and Dubai. Binani fought a price war with the Birlas, ACC and Ambuja and created the 11.25 MTPA Binani Cement. Building plants worldwide was the beginning of his troubles. Binani cut costs but the infrastructure slowdown was too severe. In 2014, the Rajasthan government attached its 26 bank accounts under the VAT Act for recovering tax dues.In July 2017, Binani was admitted for insolvency proceedings to recover dues of Rs7,000 crore. In the first round of bids, Rajputana Properties, a subsidiary of rival Dalmia Bharat, submitted the highest bid. However, Aditya Birla's UltraTech submitted a revised offer for Rs7,960 crore. The NCLAT has concluded the hearing and reserved judgment.Now, Binani has assets in glass fibre and related composites, energy and industrial infrastructure. The holding company, Binani Industries, posted standalone revenue of Rs32.93 crore in the last fiscal and a loss of Rs5.05 crore.The Miglanis - Losing SheenThe Rajinder Kumar Miglani-led family, too, will lose specialty steel company Uttam Galva Steels (UGSL) and subsidiaries Uttam Galva Metallics and Uttam Value Steels. It owes 18 lenders around Rs6,200 crore in principal and interest payment. The subsidiaries owe Rs5,400 crore. ArcelorMittal had a 29.05 per cent stake in the galvanised steels major but it was sold back to the company for the global major to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal was ready to repay the Rs7,000 crore debt of UGSL, if it gets Essar Steel. But the hope of the Miglanis ended when NCLT asked for a resolution professional.Hailing from an entrepreneurial family, group Chairman, Rajinder Kumar Miglani, started his business as a hobby in the 1960s. He started by importing galvanised steel. By 1985, he had become the largest importer of galvanised steel, feeding half the total consumption of 2 lakh tonne. Later, he put up a production line. As the market turned dynamic, he set up his own cold-rolling facility and went downstream into colour-coated steel. Uttam Galva's small galvanising capacity has risen from 30,000 tonnes a year (1985) to 7,50,000 tonnes now.RUCHI SOYA Dinesh Shahra, 66Sandeep Jajodia - Bad TradeSandeep Jajodia belonged to a trading family in Kolkata and wanted to get into manufacturing. He started his steel company, Monnet Ispat & Energy, just before marrying the daughter of O.P. Jindal of the Jindal group. Jajodia has now lost Monnet. A small consolation is that it has been bagged by his brother-in-law Sajjan Jindal's JSW Steel.It is a sad loss for a man who was nothing if not ambitious and set up a Rs1.7 crore ferro-alloy unit when he was barely 23. The stainless steel sector was kicking off in India then. He tied up with the Jindals for technology and chose Raigarh for the plant. However, he took unmanageable debt to scale up. He was, in fact, taking on debt even when steel prices were softening under the dual impact of economic slowdown and overcapacity in China. He might have a couple of small private businesses left after Monnet Ispat.The Jiwrajkas - Integration WoesThe three Jiwrajka brothers - Ashok, Dilip and Surendra - had started their textile business in a modest fashion in 1986 with a single manufacturing unit in Silvassa. Over the next two decades, they expanded into integrated textile solutions, retail and exports. They had several blue chip clients - Walmart, JC Penny, Target - and a chain of 120 stores. Nearly a third of their revenues came from exports. By 2009, they were riding high, and the next generation was ready to take off. And yes, like many others, the Jiwrajkas entered real estate, in addition to garment retailing, though textile manufacturing continued to remain their mainstay.The problems began when they expanded aggressively even as the economy was slowing rapidly. They made some ill-fated acquisitions abroad and sank a lot of money in real estate. By 2015, their debt had spiraled out of control and reached over Rs25,000 crore. By 2016, they had defaulted on loans. In 2017, the lenders took them to the NCLT and their UK retail business, Store Twenty One, entered compulsory liquidation in the UK.A consortium of Reliance Industries and JM Financial ARC is close to taking over Alok Industries for Rs5,000 crore. The Jiwrajkas will be left with no other sizeable business.Umang Kejriwal - One Gone, One LeftFor Umang Kejriwal, who has just seen his Electrosteel Steels being taken over by Vedanta, things are not good, but not that bad either. He continues to retain control of the profitable Electrosteel Castings, the company he had started off with as an executive director in 1979 and which has 60 per cent share of the ductile iron pipes market in India. Close to 75 per cent of its Rs2,000 crore revenue comes from this business. Electrosteel Castings was a highly profitable company when, 10 years ago, it set up Electrosteel Steels to enter integrated steel manufacturing with a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes at a cost of Rs11,000 crore. It was lucky enough to get coking coal and non-coking coal mines. Its problems, however, started from the beginning. The promoters had given the task of building the project to Chinese vendors. There were delays and visa problems. Then, some bank financing got delayed. Finally, the coal mines got cancelled because of a Supreme Court order. By then, steel prices had softened, and by the time the company started operations, it was already in trouble. Kejriwal explored options to repay the loans but the lenders, prodded by the RBI, referred the company to the NCLT. The plant was a good asset and snapped up by Vedanta for a song.ABG SHIPYARD Rishi Agarwal, 52Hem Singh Bharana - End of an EraHem Singh Bharana has problems other than bankruptcy proceedings against his company Era Infrastructure. The police have charged him with fraud and diversion of funds. He was briefly arrested in 2015, though he is now out of jail.Bharana's rise began when he started a construction company in 1990. By all accounts, he was a good executor, and built for NTPC, Nalco and Rail Vikas Nigam. About 15 years ago, Era went on a highway building and property development spree. But by 2014, it was running into serious cash flow troubles. Revenues halved and it started defaulting on loans. There were complaints that the promoter had used multiple subsidiaries, raised loans, diverted the money, and then defaulted. By the time Era was sent to the NCLT, there wasn't much left in the company. It is not known if Bharana has any other business.Rishi Agarwal - Sunk FortuneRishi Agarwal has lost ABG Shipyard to lenders. He is also fighting a criminal complaint from Standard Chartered Bank. The Purdue University graduate is a first-time entrepreneur who built a large shipbuilding business and lost it before he hit 50.ABG was born when Agarwal bought a small ship-building facility called Magdala Shipyard Pvt Ltd, a repairer of small boats. The ambitious Agarwal set up building scale and sophistication. By 2005, the shipyard was capable of building bulk carriers, specialised defence vehicles, and other big ships.But he was deep in debt. In 2016/17, revenues were Rs16.40 crore, while debt was Rs10,000 crore. A restructuring saw bankers take control in 2016 by converting debt into equity. By the time it came up for resolution, Agarwal no longer had anything to do with his company.Will he start again from scratch? One will have to wait and see.@nevinjl",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/cover-story/billions-to-bust/story/282440.html

2018-08-21,"The aggregate value of promoter holdings in 15 top Tata group companies has crossed $100 billion (Rs 7.03 lakh crore), thanks to the recent surge in TCS and Titan stocks and the depreciation witnessed in the Indian rupee. The market capitalisation of IT bellwether gained slightly on Monday, though it couldn't overtake billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL). TCS value by Monday's closing stood at Rs 7.7 lakh crore, as compared to Rs 7.83 lakh crore of RIL. Titan is the second most valued company (Rs 81,889 crore) in Tata group, followed by Tata Motors (Rs 77,828 crore) and Tata Steel (Rs 67,521 crore).RIL's share price jumped by 2.61 per cent to Rs 1235.15 on Monday and it catapulted the wealth of Ambani family to Rs 3.7 lakh crore ($53 billion). However, the promoter wealth of TCS alone stood at Rs 5.54 lakh crore ($79.21 billion). Ambanis own 47.35 per cent stake in RIL, compared to 71.92 per cent held by promoters of TCS.In April, TCS had breached the $100 billion market capitalisation mark. However, RIL regained the top spot in July last. Last week, TCS went past RIL again, but it was short-lived as RIL bounced back on Monday. However, the fall of Indian rupee, which is at around 70 against the US dollar, has helped the Tata promoters to reach $100 billion valuation from their promoter holding in 15 companies. The Tata Trusts through the holding companies -- Tata Sons and Tata Industries -- control the promoter stake in group companies. Besides, the group companies have many cross-holdings.It was mostly the personal wealth of Tata founders that was transferred to form Tata Trusts -- which include Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Allied Trusts. Tata Trusts controls 66 per cent of the shares of Tata Sons, the principal investment holding company and the promoter of Tata companies. The Pallonji Mistry family also holds 18 per cent stake in Tata Sons.The aggregate market capitalisation of 15 Tata group companies comes to Rs 11.32 lakh crore. The one next to Tatas is HDFC -- which includes HDFC Ltd, HDFC Bank, HDFC Asset Management Company and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company -- and its aggregate valuation comes close to Rs 10 lakh crore. In the market valuation game, Bajaj Group companies come fourth after RIL. The market value of RIL started riding high especially after the launch of digital service business, Reliance Jio, in September 2016.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/promoter-holding-tata-companies-value-100-billion-ambani-family-wealth/story/281505.html

While the Sensex rose 89 points to 34,395, Nifty closed 20 points higher to 10,548 level. India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday monsoon rains are likely to be 97 per cent of their long-term average in 2018, reassuring farmers ahead of summer planting in a country where only half of the farmland is irrigated.The BSE index which opened nearly 100 points higher marked its longest winning run since early September 2014 after close. Diversified consumer goods manufacturer Hindustan Unilever (HUL) hit its 52 week high level of Rs 1,450 on expectations of a normal monsoon. The stock closed 1.83% higher at 1,445 level. Mahindra and Mahindra, which is among the world's largest tractor maker, rose to its 52 week high of 819 level on BSE.  The stock closed 1.05% higher at Rs 809 on BSE. Normal monsoon will bring cheers to the farmers with water available in abundance for their crops. This in turn would spur sales of farm equipment and agricultural products.Mahindra and Mahindra is also engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling farm equipments, agricultural machinery, equipment and other agriculture products.Abhijeet Dey, senior fund manager-equities at BNP Paribas Mutual Fund said, ""Markets traded on a volatile note as lacklustre industrial production numbers dampened sentiment. Industrial production grew just 6% in March, compared with 7.2% in the first two months of the year, and 6.8% overall for the quarter. Both the benchmark Sensex and the Nifty finally closed the day with marginal gains. Sectoral performance on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) was mixed. While the PSU banking, media, IT and auto indices traded with losses, the FMCG index registered sharp gains.""On the Sensex, top gainers were PowerGrid (2.94%), NTPC (1.99%) and Hindustan Unilever (1.83%)  were the top Sensex gainers.

Sameet Chavan, chief analyst, Technical and Derivatives at Angel Broking said, ""It was a day of consolidation for our market as we saw a flat opening followed by some correction and then a gradual recovery throughout the second half to reclaim the 10550 mark. If we look at the index, it's clearly not going anywhere. The real action was seen in individual stocks, which kept lot of traders engaged during the course of action. As far as index view is concerned, we would continue with our recent stance and expect the Nifty to gradually march towards its sturdy wall of 10580 - 10640. We reiterate that it would be an opportunity for short term traders to liquidate longs and remain light on positions. One should expect some consolidation for next couple of days before market giving any kind of directional move. Hence, intraday traders are advised to keep focusing on individual stocks and should rather adopt a proper exit strategy. For the coming session, the support now would be seen at 10500 - 10450 levels.""Meanwhile, the Indian rupee fell to its seven-month low on concerns over widening of trade deficit amid heightened geopolitical worries.

2018-07-25,"Recent buzz had suggested that the Tata Group was ready to start focussing on new businesses like smart cities but latest developments suggest that the conglomerate's chairman N. Chandrasekaran is still concentrating on getting the house in order first. According to The Economic Times, Tata Sons, the investment holding company of the $100-billion Tata Group, has approved a Rs 10,161-crore investment plan that focuses on the conglomerate's finance, insurance, defence, realty and retail units - all areas that its chairman is aggressively betting on. The Tata Group has been in serious consolidation mode - focussing on growth, scale, synergies and making itself leaner - in the past year under Chandrasekaran, who took over the reins after Cyrus Mistry's ouster. Two key challenges that he faces are turning around loss-making units and ensuring the right capital allocation for growing businesses. So he is reportedly looking to trim unscalable businesses to concentrate more on sectors and companies expected to clock a high growth rate. In line with this game plan, the daily added that Tata Sons has decided to invest up to Rs 1,800 crore in Tata Advance Systems; Rs 1,750 crore in Tata Realty & Infrastructure; Rs 2,500 crore in Tata Capital; Rs 260 crore in Tata AIG General Insurance; Rs 250 crore in Infiniti Retail; and Rs 2,001crore in subsidiary holding company Panatone Finvest. The investment budget also includes Rs 1,600 crore earmarked for a possible acquisition of IDBI Federal Life Insurance. The company reportedly took the decisions in its board meetings on March 26 and May 18.The Group might leverage its cash cow Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for this. After all, the IT firm announced a Rs 16000 crore share buyback plan just last month. Given that Tata Sons has a 73 per cent stake in TCS and, if it tenders shares, could stand to gain around Rs 10,000 crore from the buyback and the cash may be used to steer core sectors forward. It had raked in a similar amount when it tendered over 3.61 crore shares in TCS' similar-sized buyback programme last year. The funds were reportedly used to unwind the complicated crossholdings among Tata companies. Chandrasekaran took over reins when the Group was going through turbulent times - the European steel business was bleeding, the Indian telecom arm was accumulating losses, the automobile business was losing market share and the brand image had taken a hit from the public spat with Mistry.His first-year report card has been pretty impressive so far, and he has addressed many of the legacy issues of the Tata Group companies. His tenure has also seen three major deals - merging Tata's mobile services business with Bharti Airtel in no-debt and no-cash deal, merging Tata Steel's European business with German company ThyssenKrupp's business in the region, and Tata Steel's acquisition of Bhushan Steel, unless NCLAT throws a spanner in the works.Chandrasekaran has also divided the Group's companies into various clusters, like one for finance and a separate one for aerospace, defence and infrastructure. Large companies Tata Steel, Tata Motors and TCS have their own independent clusters. Citing experts the daily added that going by Tata Sons' recent moves, Chandrasekaran is focussing on aggressively growing the diversified conglomerate even as he continues to streamline the group. That apart, he is concentrating more on the domestic market rather than the uncertain and slow global markets, which currently yield about 60 per cent of the conglomerate's revenues.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/tata-sons-earmarks-rs-10161-crore-investment-in-5-group-units-including-retail-insurance/story/280654.html

2018-12-04,"To take on the challenge of women employees dropping out of the workforce, companies are now drafting policies to welcome female workers looking to make a comeback. Companies like Tata Steel, RBS, Genpact and Amazon have programmes that ensure their transition back to work life is seamless. For instance, the Women in Technology Forum led by RBS aims to create awareness among more than 29,000 women across the country, as mentioned in The Economic Times. Companies like RBS' in-house Second Careers Internship programme is looking to take the initiative to other business units in India, as mentioned in the daily. Similarly, Mahindra Logistics' second-careers programme, Udaan, seeks to build gender diversity in a workplace dominated by men by bringing back women employees who have been on a break of six months to five years.The Tata Group's programme for returning female workers is called Tata Second Careers Inspiring Possibilities (SCIP). The programme offers flexible work hours to help women work from home and maintain work-life balance. Companies like Amazon constantly evolve their second-career programmes. Amazon's initiative, called Rekindle is constantly evolving based on the feedback it receives. Meanwhile, companies like Genpact have programmes such as Career 2.0 that aims to bring back women in sabbatical for executive-level positions. Career 2.0 that runs only on social media has hired more than 90 women so far since 2015. As found in the study, 2018 Working Mother & AVTAR Best Companies for Women, 51% of the 100 Best Companies have similar formal programmes to bring back women.

2018-03-05,"Lakshmi Mittal might be the king of steel elsewhere but his company ArcelorMittal still needs a foothold in India. Mittal is now making a desperate attempt to build a substantial presence on Indian shores with his bid for the stressed assets of Essar Steel. The India born tycoon may come in the way of the efforts by the Ruias, Essar Steel promoters, to save the company from slipping out of their grasp. Rewant Ruia's Aurora Investments is a minority shareholder in the only other bidder for the company - a consortium Numetal led by VTB Capital.Mittal had made some headway in India when his group's ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV bought a 29.05 per cent stake in Uttam Galva Steels in 2009. He decided to offload his stake in Uttam Galva at a rock bottom price to his co-promoters to meet the eligibility criteria for bidding for Essar Steel's assets. Both bids for Essar Steel require a nod from the interim resolution professional (IRP) to move forward. But Mittal has made sure he stays in the reckoning, an attempt to change the fortunes of his group in India. The Ruias though will put up a spirited fight to save the asset and prevent a further slimming of their group. Recently, they sold Essar Oil to Russian conglomerate Roseneft. In the past decade, ArcelorMittal Group made some valiant attempts to scale up in India. It included MoUs with states like Jharkhand, Odisha, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal for projects that entailed an investment of anywhere between Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore. But they only made big newspaper stories and there has been little progress on the ground. The group is also discussing a proposal to set up an auto-grade steel mill with SAIL.Uttam Galva, Mittal's entry vehicle into India, too is a bank defaulter and is undergoing insolvency proceedings. Critics point out that his investments in the company couldn't save it. Will he be able to turn around Essar Steel? Only time will tell but Mittal made his fortune by acquiring stressed assets across the globe. It all started in the 90s when his companies started picking up stressed assets in countries like Indonesia, Ireland, Canada, Kazakhsthan, Trinidad &Tobago and Mexico. After limited success with his acquisitions in his previous purchases in Canada and Germany, he started looking at assets in former Soviet Union countries, especially those in a financial mess. This includes his 1995 pick Karmet Steel works at Temirtau in Kazakhstan for $400m. This was also the time when steel consumption picked up in neighbouring China and turned around his fortunes. In 2004, he emerged as the world's biggest steel maker. His Ispat International NV acquired another group company LNM Holding and then merged with International Steel Group, forming Mittal Steel. The journey, which started in 1976, with LNM Group setting up its first steel mill with 26,000 tonne capacity in Indonesia, led to this conglomerate with 42.1 MT steel shipments and profits of $22 billion that year. In the next two years, he made the group a behemoth, with the acquisition of European steel major Arcelor Steel after hectic boardroom negotiations and overcoming opposition from then chairman of the company Guy Dolle and French President Jacques Chirac. But India still remained beyond Mittal's reach.ArcelorMittal controls 10 per cent of global steel manufacturing and was one of the first to have annual output cross 100 million tonnes (MT). Turnover in 2017 reached $68.6 billion. But all this didn't come easy. In 2015, ArcelorMittal reported a whopping debt of $15 billion and losses amounted to $7.9 billion. The steel giant is still making efforts to cut down on its debt. In a statement released on January 31, the company has set a net debt target of $6 billion. It appears difficult because, globally, the steel sector is battling two big challenges: overcapacity and dumping from China. Along with this, the group's arm in South Africa is battling a fuel crunch. Earlier in 2016, the South Africa's competition tribunal fined the company 100 million rand for price rigging. The group has already paid the first instalment of this fine. Mittal has investments in HPCL's Bhatinda oil refinery and along with ONGC's foreign investment arm -- OVL -- floated OMEL (ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd) to buy stakes in oil assets. The distress sale of Essar Steel and other assets may help Mittal in expanding his footprint in India.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/lakshmi-mittal-bid-for-essar-steel-numetal-ruia/story/271976.html
2018-02-06,"ArcelorMittal's plan to exit the debt-loaded Uttam Galva (UVL) triggers the speculation that the world's largest steelmaker may posture bullishly in its bid for Essar Steel. Earlier, the company had withdrawn from bidding in the insolvency proceedings for other big steel companies Bhushan Steel, Bhushan Power, and Steel and Monnet Ispat after doing due diligence. Reports say the co-promoter ArcelorMittal looks to sell its 29.1 per cent stake (41.3 million shares) in UVL at a nominal Rs 1 a share --- the share price closed at Rs 18.65 on Tuesday --- to the promoters Miglani family on Wednesday, and meet the eligibility criteria set under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to bid for the stressed steel assets.The amendments to the IBC had restricted the errant promoters of the distressed companies from bidding for similar assets on block. The hasty move of ArcelorMittal will clear its way for Essar Steel bidding, which will be closed on February 12. Uttam Galva defaulted Rs 110 crore loans last year and in April, one of the lenders, DF Deutsche Forfait, took them to the Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).Ankit Miglani, former managing director of UVL, told Reuters ArcelorMittal's sale price would be below the market value. ArcelorMittal chairman LN Mittal has long been planning to build a steel plant in the country but failed to do it because of the regulatory hassles. Essar's 10 million tonne (MT) steel plant in Hazira, Gujarat, will fit into its plan to create a sizable footprint in the Rs 3.15 lakh crore Indian steel market. ArcelorMittal also formed a joint venture with SAIL in 2015 for manufacturing autograde steel in the country. According to the World Steel Association, steel production in India is projected to grow at 7.1 per cent, the highest rate among the top 10 steel-using countries, in 2018.Bids for troubled steelmaker Bhushan Steel is expected to open any time soon, in which JSW Steel, Tata Steel and a consortium of 400 Bhushan employees along with a Singapore-based private fund are in the race. JSW Steel- AION Capital consortium was the only bidder for Monnet Ispat, which is in the insolvency proceedings.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/will-arcelormittal-shed-uttam-galva-for-essar-steel/story/270015.html

2018-09-09,"India may impose anti-dumping duty of up to $185.51 per tonne for five years on certain varieties of Chinese steel with a view to guard domestic players from cheap imports of the commodity from the neighbouring country.JSW Steel Ltd, Sunflag Iron and Steel Co, Usha Martin, Gerdau Steel India, Vardhman Special Steels and Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd had jointly filed an application for initiation of the investigations and levying of anti-dumping duties on the steel.In its anti-dumping investigations, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has stated that dumped imports of 'straight length bars and rods of alloy steel' from China have increased in absolute terms during the period of probe (2016-17).It said that the dumped imports are undercutting the prices of the domestic industry and due to this the domestic industry's profits, return on capital employed and cash profits have declined during 2016-17.""The authority recommends imposition of anti-dumping duty"" on the imports from China ""for period of five years,"" the DGTR has said in a notification.It has recommended duty in the range of $44.89 per tonne and $185.51 per tonne.However, it added that no anti-dumping duty shall be payable on imports of forged bars and tool and die steel if their landed value is above $659.91 per tonne.If the landed value is lower than $659.91 per tonne, then the difference between that value and $659.91 per tonne shall be payable as anti-dumping duty, it added.While the DGTR, under the commerce ministry, recommends the duty, the final call is being taken by the finance ministry.Imports of straight length bars and rods of alloy steel from China have increased to 1,80,959 tonnes in 2016-17 from 56,690 tonnes in 2013-14. India's total imports rose to 2,56,004 tonnes in 2016-17 from 1,32,933 tonnes in 2013-14.The demand of this steel in India too increased to 16,69,653 tonnes in 2016-17 from 15,14,795 tonnes in 2013-14.Domestic steel manufacturers always flag concerns over the imports from the neighbouring country, with which India has a huge trade deficit.The trade gap with China has increased to $63.12 billion in 2017-18 from $51.11 billion in the previous financial year.The DGTR has also stated it recognises that the imposition of anti-dumping duties might affect the price levels of the product in India. However, fair competition in the market will not be impacted by the imposition of these trade remedy measures.On the contrary, imposition of anti-dumping measures would remove the unfair advantages gained by dumping practices, prevent the decline of the domestic industry and help maintain availability of wider choice to the consumers of these goods, it added.In general, the purpose of these duties is to eliminate injury caused to the domestic industry by the unfair trade practices of dumping so as to re-establish a situation of open and fair competition in the Indian market, which is in interest of the country.""Imposition of anti-dumping duties, therefore, would not affect the availability of the product to the consumers,"" it said.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/india-may-impose-anti-dumping-on-certain-type-of-chinese-steel/story/282179.html

As mentioned in the resolution plan, the combine intends to restructure the capital of the company where the number of shares held by the Monnet Ispat's shareholders will be cut down to one-third. This could end up eliminating shareholders with small quantities of the company's total shares.This comes close on the heels of JSW Steel-AION combine agreeing to pay Rs 25 crore to operational creditors of Monnet Ispat after the NCLT raised fingers on the fact that there was nothing for the small shareholders. This led to the original offer of Rs 2,850 crore being revised to Rs 2,875 crore with Rs 1,000 crore pledged over and above for equity and working capital requirements.This led to the original offer of Rs 2,850 crore being revised to Rs 2,875 crore with Rs 1,000 crore pledged over and above for equity and working capital requirements.Monnet Ispat was one of the twelve corporate defaulters listed by the Reserve Bank of India for heavy loan defaults. The resolution plan for the metals company is the third after Tata Steel got the NCLT approval for acquiring Bhushan Steel and Electrosteel Steels went to Vedanta Group. The next in line for the NCLT approval could be the resolution plan by Reliance Industries-JM Financial ARC consortium for Alok Industries.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/jsw-steel-aion-resolution-plan-for-monnet-ispat-gets-nclt-approval/story/280450.html
2018-06-13,"The man and his company have repeatedly been in the news in recent months, as the process of selling off stressed assets under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) - passed in May 2016 - gathers steam. When bids were invited for shipbuilding company ABG Shipyard, Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House was the only company to respond, even raising its offer to Rs5,600 crore when the initial bid was rejected as too low. Liberty House was the higher of the two bidders for auto parts maker Amtek Auto, quoting Rs4,334 crore, as it was for steel manufacturer Adhunik Metaliks.Liberty House entered the fray for Bhushan Steel after the bid deadline but with an offer of Rs18,500 crore. Though it was substantially larger than the second highest bid of Tata Steel at Rs17,000 crore, it was rejected as it came after the deadline. The proposed acquisitions are all facing hurdles, notably because it emerged that Liberty House owed Exim Bank around $2.8 million and was thus liable for disqualification under Section 29A of the IBC - though Gupta insists he has since paid up - but there is no doubt that both Gupta and Liberty House suddenly loom large over India's business landscape.Who is Sanjeev Gupta? He is a 47-year-old NRI billionaire, headquartered in the UK, whose Liberty House, part of the conglomerate called Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, has been making an astonishing series of acquisitions of loss-making companies over the past five years. The assets range from the UK and France to Australia, encompassing the US. ""We have taken over around 50 assets investing $3 billion since 2013,"" Gupta told Business Today.The bigger acquisitions include global mining and metals' giant Rio Tinto's aluminium smelter plants in Scotland and France, for $412 million and $500 million, respectively; the takeover of Australian mining and materials' company Arrium for $750 million, as well as steelmaker ArcelorMittal's Georgetown Steelworks in South Carolina, US, for an undisclosed amount. Another big buy was Tata Steel's specialty steel division in the UK for $134 million. Indeed, Liberty House was in talks to buy up Tata Steel's entire loss-making UK steel operations before Cyrus Mistry's abrupt removal as Tata Sons chairman in November 2016 put paid to the negotiations. It has also bought up Amtek Auto's UK assets.GFG Alliance comprises chiefly Liberty House, engaged in steel and aluminium manufacturing, commodities trading, recycling and auto engineering and components businesses, run by Gupta; SIMEC, a clutch of companies involved in renewable energy, mining, ports and more, set up and run by Gupta's father Praduman Gupta; JAHUMA Estates, which owns vast land parcels in the UK and engages in real estate, and financial services companies, including two recently acquired UK banks - Wyelands (formerly Tungsten) Bank and Diamond Bank (to be renamed British Commonwealth Trade Bank, once all the approvals are through). In 2015/16, the group had revenues of around $10 billion, but Gupta expects the figure to have swelled to $15 billion by 2017/18, following the acquisitions since then, with an operating profit of around $500 million. By themselves, Liberty House's financials are more modest - according to filings in the UK, and excluding its steel business, it had revenues of less than $60 million in 2014, with profits of $90,626.Liberty House and SIMEC have made such major acquisitions in Australia - apart from Arrium, they have taken over renewable energy developer and storage battery maker Zen Energy, the Tahmoor coal mine - that Gupta has shifted residence to Sydney with wife Nicola and their three children. His plans for India are wildly ambitious - against the $3 billion spent worldwide in the last five years, he wants to invest $5 billion (Rs32,500 crore) in Indian stressed assets alone. He also insists he is not looking only for bargain buys in India, but also wants to invest another $5 billion in financial services, making electric vehicles and acquisition of other assets.Not surprisingly, some quarters are suspicious. ""There are a lot of missing elements in Sanjeev Gupta's success story,"" says the CEO of an Indian metals company. ""He suddenly surfaced with a large bounty to buy assets from companies like ArcelorMittal, Rio Tinto and Tata Steel. It's not clear how he made his wealth. If huge corporations failed to turn these sick assets around, how will he?""No Mystery ManGupta, however, appears willing to talk about himself and his rise. He says he was born wealthy, with his father owning steel-rolling mills in Ludhiana and Pune. Later his father and uncles added a bicycle-making business - the birth of SIMEC. The business grew and expanded to Nigeria, where they started more businesses. His uncles continue to run businesses in Nigeria. Born in Ludhiana, Gupta did his final schooling in the UK.""At the beginning of my Class X, when I was around 14, I went to London to visit my elder brother who was already studying there,"" he says. ""I found the UK interesting and told my parents I didn't want to return."" His parents acquiesced, and he was enrolled in a school at Canterbury, Kent. Gupta went on to Trinity College, Cambridge. His business genes were already at work - while at college itself, in 1992, he started Liberty House, initially as a trading company which sold caustic soda and other chemicals to Nigeria, bought from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). ""I was called 'Mr Caustic Soda' in those days, but, in fact, we were supplying around 80 products to Nigeria, from rice and fish to fast- moving consumer goods to mosquito coil, glass and paper,"" he says. ""Later we started industrial production in Nigeria itself and cut down on sourcing.""The first sick company Gupta tried to buy was Alpha Steel in Newport, UK, in 2007, but he was outbid by a Russian company, which renamed it Mir Steel. But Mir Steel failed to take off as well, and was finally sold to Gupta in 2013. The company is still struggling, but is much better off than before. ""In its heyday, the plant made one million tonne (MT) of steel annually, but now makes half that much,"" says Gupta. ""We're in the process of restarting the blast furnaces to take it to 1 MT."" But he has been able, over two years, to resolve all the 100-odd legal wrangles Mir Steel was embroiled in.Gupta's big opportunity came with the crash in global steel prices in 2015. It left Tata Steel's UK business tottering, and also led to the collapse of many other steel plants, among them those of high-profile NRI industrialist Swaraj Paul's Caparo Group. A number of Caparo companies went up for sale around the time Mir Steel went on stream, and Gupta bid for all of them. ""There were 20 plants across the country employing 2,000 people,"" he says. Ultimately, however, he was able to acquire just two - Caparo Tubular Solutions, with around 350 employees, and Caparo Merchant Bar, with about 150.Thereafter acquisitions by both Liberty House and GFG Alliance multiplied. Liberty House bought Amtek Auto's bankrupt units in the UK, CovPress and Shiftec, making it - according to Gupta - the largest auto components player in the country, while the parent conglomerate acquired France-based aluminium wheels manufacturer, AR Industries. With the purchase of the aluminium smelting unit in France from Rio Tinto, the auto business and the upstream aluminium business were integrated. Tata Steel's specialty steel mills followed. There were more acquisitions in steel, auto and aluminium. Liberty House's steelmaking capacity alone is around 8 MT.To save on power costs, Gupta bought a thermal power plant near the Mir Steel unit in Newport and converted into a captive waste-to-energy plant. So too, Zen Energy in Australia is helping meet the power needs of Arrium, the sole maker of long steel in that country. Other power plant purchases have given GFG Alliance a portfolio of around 1,000 MW. Alongside came the foray into financial services, with Gupta acquiring Wyelands Bank and Diamond Bank, an insurance company, an investment banking advisory business and a fintech platform. Overall, GFG Alliance now has a presence in 30 countries, with over 11,000 employees at 200 locations. Its trading business spans 60 countries.It plans to grow even more. Gupta hopes to build steelmaking capacity of 10 MT in Australia alone, along with 10,000 MW of renewable energy plants. In the US, Georgetown Steelworks will start operations this month, and more acquisitions will follow. In France, he wants to set up an aluminium car body making unit alongside the smelter plant, with an investment of $3.5 billion.But where does the money for all these acquisitions come from? ""Since we're a private business house, people don't know the kind of wealth created by our companies,"" says Gupta. ""Our family has significant financial resources. Our internal accruals are huge. But it is only from 2013 that we have started acquiring and also telling our story to the world."" He maintains he has never taken loans to fund acquisitions so far, though this may well change in future. ""We will raise debt capital and look at public listing of some of our companies as well for our future acquisitions and expansions,"" he says.No doubt, Gupta's sudden prominence has spawned critics and sceptics. ""The suspicion is that most of the assets were bought at zero value when the metals and commodity businesses were in shambles,"" says Sanjay Sethi, Managing Partner and CEO of financial consultancy firm, Nestor Consulting. ""But those who bought the distressed will have to repay at least a part of the debt as well."" (Gupta denies this, maintaining he has taken over only the employees and the assets of the acquired companies, not their liabilities.) UK media reports have noted that Liberty House is registered in the tax haven of the Isle of Mann, while SIMEC operates through a complex web of companies stretching from Wales to Singapore.Plans for IndiaAt present, Gupta does not even have a corporate office in India, though he intends to set up one in Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla complex soon. But he does own large swathes of land - all those locations where his grandfather's steel-rolling mills once stood. ""After my father gave away the bicycle business to his brothers, we have no business left in India,"" he says. But that is soon going to change. ""Our biggest story this year will be in India,"" he adds. ""In the last decade, there was much pressure on me to build something in India, but this is a tough country to do business in, so things have been delayed.""He tried to enter India twice before, but failed both times - in 2003 and 2010/11. This time too, there have been hiccups, notably Exim Bank's pending dues from Liberty House, which he hopes will now cease to be an issue. Gupta was also late in bidding for BPSL, doing so well after the deadline of early February this year, which prompted the resolution professional (RP) handling the matter to refuse considering it. Rival bidder Tata Steel also insisted the bid be rendered invalid. The NCLT, however, has rejected this plea and Liberty House is back in the running. Not that it means BPSL is a cinch for Gupta. Under the IBC, the RP is required to consider several aspects of every bid, not just the valuation offered. ""There is lack of clarity about the group structure of GFG,"" says a lawyer on condition of anonymity. ""They call it an alliance, but Liberty House and SIMEC sometimes do business together.""Gupta intends to bid for more steel assets in India. ""We are negotiating with other small steel companies,"" he says. He also plans to enter financial services in the country and manufacture EVs, using the Amtek Auto platform once he gains control of the company. Liberty House has associated with Formula 1 car designer Gordon Murray, who designed iStream - the light car body structure which will be used for EVs. ""We want to launch it in India and Australia in the next two years,"" he says.@nevinjl",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-hub/sanjeev-gupta-liberty-house-nri-billionaire-gupta-family-group-alliance/story/278884.html

2018-11-13,"It is going to be 17 months since Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had first asked the banks to take the 12 big loan defaulters to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and try under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The move which was perceived as a bold step was expected to tame the ballooning non-performing assets (NPAs) on the books of banks and revive the debt-ridden companies bringing in a responsible management. Has it achieved the desired results?Of the 1198 bankrupt companies admitted for resolution, just 52 are being sold until September end. The liquidation process has started in 212 cases. There are 816 cases pending for resolution. According to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the IBC allowed resolution time of 270 days are over in 238 cases. The current law allows a maximum 270 days for resolution- an initial 180 days and an extra 90 days extension on case by case basis. By September end, 158 cases had crossed initial deadline of 180 days. One reason for the delays is that the government has made many changes in the law through two amendments. There are lengthy legal proceedings due to complications in defining the law. The lack of sufficient resources in terms of insolvency professionals, judicial benches and technical experts at NCLT is another issue.In September, finance minister Arun Jaitley said that the banks would recover Rs 1.8 lakh crore from overall NPAs through insolvency and other resolution mechanisms. The overall NPA so far would come around Rs 10 lakh crore.The court initiated resolution process in the 12 companies, which together had an outstanding claim of Rs 3.45 lakh crore, soon after and four companies have been handed over to the new promoters-Electrosteel Steels to Vedanta; Bhushan Steel to Tata Steel; Monnet Ispat to JSW Steel; and Amtek Auto to Liberty House. The financial creditors had an admitted claim of Rs 13,175 crore in Electrosteel, but the deal with Vedanta fetched just 40.38 per cent of the claim at Rs 5,320 crore. In Amtek, the claim was Rs 12,605 crore, but the realisation was Rs 4334 crore, 34.38 per cent. The lowest was in Monnet, the Rs 2,892 crore deal was just 26.26 per cent of the admitted claim. But Bhushan had the highest realisation of 63.50 per cent as the deal was Rs 35,571 crore against the claim of Rs 56,022 crore.NCLT had ordered to liquidate Lanco Infratech and Jyoti Structures, which are in the first list of 12 cases. The remaining six cases are still in the lengthy court proceedings. For Essar Steel, the lenders backed the Rs 42,000 crore repayment plan of ArcelorMittal. However, the erstwhile promoters, the Ruia family had submitted a Rs 54,000 crore bid recently to get back control of the steel company. The plan involved repaying all lenders and operational creditors in full. They said the submission had been made under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which allows companies to be withdrawn from the resolution process.In the initial round of bidding, another firm Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL) received bids of Rs 11,000 crore from JSW Steel, Rs 17,000 crore from Tata Steel and Rs 18,500 crore from Liberty House. JSW subsequently revised its bid to Rs 19,700 crore, which has now won the lenders' approval.But Tata Steel recently alleged that lenders have violated orders of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) by allowing JSW to change the basic parameters of its bid three times after the deadline. In the other four cases-Jaypee Infratech, Era Infra Engineering, Alok Industries and ABG Shipyard-the resolution process is on but there is no clarity yet on whether they will be sold to anyone.Outside the big 12 cases, the lenders of Ruchi Soya had approved the Rs 6,000-crore bid of Adani Wimar in June but the deal is not yet concluded.

2018-10-31,"Over the last 15 years, Odisha has been single-mindedly focused on fast GSDP growth and becoming the country's top aluminum and stainless steel producer with the help of big investments. The efforts have paid off. It is now a hub for primary metals with presence of big metal companies such as Tata Steel, Bhushan Steel and JSPL. It accounts for one-fifth of the country's steel production and almost half its aluminum production. Also, its GSDP growth has been surpassing the national rate for some years, mainly due to rich mineral reserves. The state, after all, accounts for 52.3 per cent of India's iron ore, 21.6 per cent of coal and 49.7 per cent of bauxite deposits.Now, the state is on the cusp of change as it looks to move from being a supplier of raw materials to a maker of value-added products. For that, it has built a downstream park in Kalinganagar, an area which has steady supply of raw material. ""The state government has given approval in principle to Jindal Stainless and Jindal Steel and Power. Vedanta and Hindalco have also sent proposals. We are following up with the Tatas,"" says Sanjeev Chopra, Principal Secretary (Industry), Odisha.The state has identified six sectors for attracting investments under Vision 2025. These include downstream industries; food processing and sea food; plastics, chemicals and petrochemicals; ESDM (Electronic System Design and Manufacturing) and IT/ITeS; textiles and apparels; and tourism. To promote these sectors, it has developed sector-specific clusters such as a National Investment and Manufacturing Zone in Kalinganagar, an Aluminum Park in Angul, a Plastics Park in Paradip, and a Sea Food Park in Deras, among others. The aluminum park will leverage Orissa's bauxite reserves. The park will be the first such in the subcontinent with a facility to directly obtain molten aluminium from the smelter. The plastics park will get feedstock such as polypropylene and ethylene derivatives from an Indian Oil plant just 5 km away.Apart from working on building infrastructure, the government has also introduced a policy for private industrial parks. ""We are probably the only state in the country that encourages private industrial parks where government gives 50 per cent subsidy for internal infrastructure and also funds the external infrastructure,"" says Chopra.These parks will help Odisha kick-start an MSME boom. Traditionally, the state has been focused on large industries, which has led to growth but not created the desired number of jobs. The Reserve Bank of India data for 2015 pegs the state's unemployment rate at 3.8 per cent, slightly more than the national average of 3.7 per cent (2015/16), but more than that of several states. A World Bank report says jobs in Odisha grew just 0.7 per cent from 2005 to 2012. Half the state's population still depends on farming. According to the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Annual Report 2017/18, the number of MSMEs in Odisha is 19.84 lakh compared to Uttar Pradesh's 89.99 lakh and West Bengal's 88.67 lakh.""The government has been trying to promote industrial parks for quite some time. Take the case of Aluminum Park that has been there for the last five years but has not attracted investors as there isn't much infrastructure around the area,"" says Dillip Satapathy, Business Standard Resident Editor in Bhubaneshwar.According to the CMIE, new investments announced in Odisha increased a whopping 504 per cent from 2016 to 2017 at `2,06,939.49 crore. They again reduced sharply from 2017 to 2018 by 81 per cent to `48,891.6 crore. The state is also trying to urgently resolve the issue of displacement of people due to large industrial projects. To tackle this tricky issue, which has led to several controversies in the past, it plans to depend on its 1,25,000 acres land bank instead of acquiring land from private persons, except as a last resort. The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), in a report, People First: District Mineral Foundation Status Report, says even after three years of the Centre rolling out the District Mineral Foundation (to benefit mining-affected people), it has failed to identify both mining-affected people and mining-affected areas. The state, with its huge mineral deposits, needs to focus specifically in this area. @sonalkhetarpal7",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-hub/on-cusp-of-change/story/286860.html
