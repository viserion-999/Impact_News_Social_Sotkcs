2018-06-30,"Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp AG on Saturday signed definitive agreements to combine their European steel businesses in a 50/50 joint venture in a new company.This follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017.The new company will be called ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel BV, and will be based in Netherlands. The merged entity will have capacity to produce 21 million tons of steel a year, making it the second largest steelmaker in Europe after ArcelorMittal.ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel BV will have 48,000 employees across 34 sites. The company will have a revenue of about Euros 15 billion.The combined entity is expected to make an annual savings of up to Euros 500 million.The transaction is subject to merger control clearance in several jurisdictions, including the European Union.“The joint venture will create a strong pan European steel company that is structurally robust and competitive. This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company,"" said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Steel.Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger, CEO of ThyssenKrupp AG, added, ""We will secure jobs and contribute to maintaining value chains in European core industries.”A statement from Tata Steel said that the two European entities will continue to function as separate companies until the completion of the JV process.While the JV gives equal shareholding to the two companies, ThyssenKrupp will get a bigger share from the proceedings out of an expected IPO of the JV.This comes after demands from workers union and shareholders of the Germany company that Tata Steel needs to compensate for the differing performance of the two companies since September last year. While Tata Steel's EBITDA has declined by a fifth, that of its German partner has increased by a third since the announcement of the deal last year.Reports said that the deal would include a compensation for ThyssenKrupp, but the details are awaited.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Cost of raw material, which accounts for the lion's share of overall expenses, rose only 4 percent on year to Rs 10,369.77 crore.Operating profit margin for the quarter was 14.53 percent, 215 basis points lower than the 16.68 percent reported last year. This was because expenses, despite having grown at a muted pace, rose faster than the company's operating income.A Reuters poll estimated the consolidated net profit of the domestic steel-making behemoth at Rs 2,552 crore.The steel maker's deliveries in the domestic market declined to 3.03 million tons for the quarter, as production was impacted due to an unforeseen blast furnace outage at its Kalinganagar plant.

During the year, our Indian operations delivered volume growth better than the market on the back of the ramp-up at our Kalinganagar plant and the strength of our marketing network and brand equity.

2018-10-30,"The European Commission has opened a deeper investigation into ThyssenKrupp's planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel over concerns that it could raise prices and harm competition.The so-called Phase II investigation was widely expected and follows a similar probe into ArcelorMittal's takeover of Italy's Ilva, which was cleared only after the group pledged to sell assets.ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel earlier this year unveiled plans to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain to become the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.""The Commission is concerned that, following the transaction, customers would face a reduced choice in suppliers, as well as higher prices,"" the EU executive said in a statement.""These customers include various European companies, ranging from major corporations to numerous small and medium-sized enterprises,"" it added.The Commission identified three areas where the combination of both companies' speciality flat carbon steel and electrical steel products could give them a dominant position: steel for the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and grain-oriented electrical steel.Tata Steel's European unit has already put a number of assets on the block, including Cogent, a manufacturer and processor of electrical steels, and it is unclear whether these divestments would satisfy EU concerns.The Commission now has 90 working days, until March 19, 2019, to investigate the matter and take a decision.A spokeswoman for ThyssenKrupp said that the group would continue to work closely with the Commission, adding that the deepened probe was expected and standard for a transaction of this size.The move is nonetheless fuelling expectations that the deal will require asset disposals to win approval.Analysts expect few problems regarding crude steel production, where rating agency Moody's reckons the venture will control just 14 percent of the European market, a distant second to ArcelorMittal's 29 percent, which includes Ilva.But the new company, to be named ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel, would have a share of about 50 percent of the European packaging steel, or tinplate, market, a person familiar with the industry told Reuters.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-02-21,"Tata Steel’s aggressive bid for Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus Steel, over a decade ago, had surprised industry watchers at the time. Just when Tata Steel thought it had Corus in the bag, Brazil’s CSN Steel gatecrashed the party, and a fierce bidding ensued. Tata Steel eventually won what in hindsight turned out to be a pyrrhic victory.Investment bankers associated with the negotiations said that the deal had almost become a prestige issue for Ratan Tata, then the Chairman of Tata Sons.As Tata Steel now bids for distressed steel companies, buzz is that N Chandrasekaran, who completes completes a year as the Chairman of Tata Sons on Wednesday, is the architect of the strategy. The major difference this time around is that the aggression is far more measured, say analysts.Maintaining a buy on Tata Steel's stock even after it emerged the front runner for Bhushan Steel (with bid of Rs 35,000 crore) and Bhushan Power & Steel (with a bid of about Rs 24,000 crore), Amit Dixit of Edelweiss Research said that the company is unlikely to suffer from the winner's curse.""We believe, potential acquisition of these stressed assets makes strategic sense for TSL, despite the seemingly expensive valuation,"" Dixit said in a note. His belief rested on Tata Steel's access to raw materials and possible leadership in the high-margin auto steel segment (Bhushan Steel specialises in the product).If Tata Steel does manage to bag both the Bhushan companies, its capacity will go up by about 8 million tons to 21 million tons a year. That will reinforce the company as the country's biggest steel maker, a crown that JSW Steel had recently wrested from it.There is reason to believe that Chandrasekaran is deeply involved in Tata Steel's acquisition strategy. Last year, he had restructured the top deck of the company. TV Narendran, who was appointed the Managing Director for India and South East Asia markets in 2013, was elevated to CEO and MD globally.  Narendran now reports directly to Chandrasekaran.Corus puzzleUnder Chandrasekaran, Tata Steel has also taken definitive steps to reduce the burden of its European assets.In September last year, Tata Steel and Germany's Thyssenkrupp agreed to merge their European businesses to create the continent's second largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.Recent reports quoted the German steelmaker as saying that the joint venture will be finalised by early 2018.As much as Chandrasekaran will be keeping an eye on the developments in Europe, the Tata Sons Chairman would also keep a tab on Indian operations. The Kalinganagar facility, which at present manufactures 3 million tons of steel a year, will flag off the expansion of the next phase in April.Once done, the company will manufacture 8 million tons of steel in Odisha. The new facility is said to be more cost effective than the one in Jamsedhpur, and the ramp up will help improve margins of the company.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The five bidders were Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Vedanta, Kalyani Steels and Liberty House.Of these, only Tata Steel and Liberty House put in a bid.“We did give an expression of interest, but didn’t bid,” said a senior executive from one of the companies that didn’t submit an offer.“The plant was shut, is operational now but would still need a significant amount of investment,” said an executive from another company. “Tata Steel offered much higher because it doesn’t want competition to enter its backyard,” the executive added.According to sources, the second bid was around Rs 3,500 crore.Apart from the Jamshedpur-located steel plant, the unit also comes with a captive power plant, and iron ore and coal mines. The city is synonymous with Tata Steel's plant, which is over a century old.Usha Martin's steel business managed to turn around in the first quarter of the current financial year, generating a profit of Rs 112 crore, against losses of Rs 30 crore a year earlier. Much of the turnaround though would be thanks to the present upswing in the domestic steel market.“Indian steel environment currently is strongest over the last few years,” said a note from JP Morgan.Small dentThe sector’s optimistic outlook is one reason Tata Steel wouldn’t mind the Rs 4,600-crore bill.Also, the acquisition is a small one for the company, especially going by the previous Rs 32,000-crore deal to acquire Bhushan Steel. And it adds just 6 percent to its debt.As a report pointed out, Tata Steel’s first quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of Rs 5,072 crore is enough to service the debt from the Usha Martin deal.The valuation of the acquisition too, added the JP Morgan report, is “attractive.”And even though Usha Martin’s pellet plant is running at a capacity utilization of just 38 percent, Tata Steel will ramp up the production. “Pellet prices have already risen ~70-75 percent over the past two months to INR9,000-9,500/t, a seven-year high level,” observe Amit Dixit and Meera Midha of Edelweiss Securities in their note.Integrating the Usha Martin unit will come easier for Tata Steel than for any other steel player. One it’s a familiar asset. Tata Motors was one of the clients the unit supplied its steel products to.And the Usha Martin unit is just a few kilometers away from Tata Steel’s facility, making logistics the least of the challenges.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-11-01,"The European Union probe of the joint venture between Tata Steel's European unit and thyssenkrupp could eventually lead to the sale of one or more assets under the new company, to clear the regulatory hurdle.The ""in-depth investigation"" will review if the joint venture will reduce competition in the sector, especially in the niche segments that the joint venture will dominate.In a similar review, ArcelorMittal had to sell plants in four countries earlier this year to clear its proposal to acquire Italy's largest steel company Ilva.""Facilities of both the companies - Tata Steel Europe and thyssenkrupp -  specialise in flat steel. It is very possible that the European Union will ask them to divest some of their assets,"" said a senior executive from the industry.""If the JV is asked to divest facilities, then Port Talbot could be done,"" added the executive.Port Talbot in Wales hosts UK's biggest steel facility owned by Tata Steel Europe.The in-depth investigation is the second stage of the review, which was initially opened in September. The final verdict could come in two months.The joint venture will emerge as the second largest steelmaker in Europe, after ArcelorMittal, with annual revenues of 17 billion euros and production of 21 million tons.Dominant shareIncluding Ilva's facility, ArcelorMittal would have a market share of 40 percent in three products, hot rolled steel, cold rolled steel and galvanised steel. This had prompted the European Commission to begin a review of the proposed acquisition.To clear the acquisition, ArcelorMittal sold its plants in Czech Republic, Romania, Macedonia and Italy to Liberty House, the UK -based group owned by Sanjeev Gupta.The joint venture between Tata Steel Europe and thyssenkrupp will not be as dominant as ArcelorMittal. According to a report in Financial Times, the joint venture will have a 27 percent share in Europe's flat steel market.But the share could increase considerably if sub-segments of the steel market is considered. The Commission has identified three of these segments - automotive steel, coated steel used for packaging and electrical steel.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-12-24,"The newly elected Congress government in Chhattisgarh has decided to return the land of farmers in Bastar district acquired by the government in 2008 for then proposed Tata Steel plant project in the area.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has issued directions to the officials concerned for completing the process required for returning the land to farmers, mostly tribals, and present a proposal in this regard in the next Cabinet meeting, an official statement issued on December 24 said.Notably, Baghel and Congress president Rahul Gandhi had promised to farmers ahead of the just concluded state polls that their land in Lohandigua area of the district, which remained unused as Tata Steel cancelled its project, will be returned to them if the Congress came to power.In the party's manifesto also, it was promised that the agricultural lands acquired for industrial purpose, on which no project was established within five years of acquisition, will be returned to farmers.A total of 1764.61 hectare of private land of about 1,707 farmers of ten villages was acquired by then government for the Tata Steel plant in February 2008 and December 2008, a government public relation official said.The villages in which land acquisition was done includes Chhindgaon, Kumhli, Beliyapal, Bandaji, Daabpal, Bade Paroda, Belar, Dhuragaon and Sirisguda of Lohandiguda Tehsil and Takarguda under Tokapal tehsil.In 2005, Tata Steel had signed an agreement with the Raman Singh-led BJP government for setting a steel plant with an investment of around Rs 19,500 crore in Lohandiguda, he said.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-03-06,"Though US President Donald Trump’s proposal to hike duties on steel imports may have little impact on the Indian steel industry immediately, there could be larger repercussions later on.Some of the biggest exporters to the US could look for alternate markets, thus increasing the competition for Indian exports, which has been gaining volume.In 2017, India turned a net exporter of steel after imports had dominated the trade balance since the middle of 2014. But that could come under pressure now as Indian exports find increasing competition if a trade war ensues.Moreover, if exports come down, supply of steel in the domestic market may increase, putting pressure on prices.On March 1, Trump said he plans to impose a 25 percent import duty on steel in a move to protect the American industry.Indian steel doesn’t have much of a presence in the US. According to reports, anything between 2 to 5 per cent of Indian steel exports land up in the US market. Overall, India exported 4.9 million tons of steel in 2017, up from 1.8 million tons in 2016.The growth in exports have continued in the present financial year. The outflow of steel products has increased by 53 per cent in the nine months till December 2017.Much of India’s exports to the US consists of pipes and tubes. In fact, the US is the biggest market for these products from India. But these amount to less than 2 lakh tons a year.According to an official from an industry body, Maharashtra Seamless and Jindal Saw are the major exporters.“Already there is an anti-dumping duty on Indian steel products in the US. So the additional hike in duty wouldn’t have much of an impact,” said the official cited above.Increasing competitionA bigger headache though would be the increasing competition in the overseas markets.Three of the European countries – Italy, Belgium and Spain – are among the top 10 markets for Indian steel. Italy is the second largest market, after Vietnam.Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Essar Steel are among the top exporters from India. JSW Steel had achieved its highest ever exports figures in the 2017 financial year. Tata Steel’s exports grew by 60 per cent in the second quarter of the present financial year.At the same time, the US is a big export market for the European countries. According to reports, about 21 per cent of imports in the US origin from European countries. If Trump does hike the import duty, European exporters will come under pressure and may look for other markets, including those within the European Union. This will increase the competition for Indian exporters, and possible lead to price reduction.Similarly, South Korea and Taiwan are significant exporters to the US. Again, they may look to divert some of their exports to the Asian market if the duty is hiked in the US.“There will be increased supply in the Asian market, and prices could soften,” said an official from a private steel company in India.This will be bad news for Indian companies who have been enjoying a pick-up in price and demand for steel in the domestic market. Steel demand growth had improved to 5.2 percent in the first nine months of the financial year. Also, there have been two upward revisions in prices this year.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

2018-06-11,"Tata Steel's European labour representatives said they remain unconvinced by a planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, adding there were still numerous details that needed to be hammered out before they could endorse a deal.The remarks by Tata Steel Europe's European Works Council (EWC) threatens a further delay to a deal to combine Thyssenkrupp's steel operations with Tata's European steel business, a pact which has not been signed because of resistance from Dutch workers.""The EWC acknowledges there is an industrial rationale for pursuing this JV, but with the matters outstanding the EWC remains unconvinced that this partnership with Thyssenkrupp would be in the best interests of the Tata Steel Europe's operations and the employees we represent,"" it said in a statement.Thyssenkrupp said in May it expected to be able to sign the deal with Tata Steel, agreed in principle last September, in the first half of 2018. Tata Steel confirmed that timeline at the time.The planned transaction would combine Thyssenkrupp's and Tata Steel's European steel operations to create the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with sales of 15 billion euros ($17.7 billion).The EWC said Thyssenkrupp had been unwilling to engage and help its advisers understand the German firm's aspirations and plans with regards to the join venture, adding the financial structure of the deal remains a ""work in progress"".A Tata Steel spokesman told Reuters: ""We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our employee representatives throughout the process of creating the proposed joint venture.""He added that Tata Steel is committed to delivering the joint venture without the need for compulsory redundancies.Tata's Dutch works council said in April it still had ""major reservations"" over the joint venture, even though Tata promised limited job losses and an independent position for the Dutch operations within the new company.The EWC, which oversees all the Tata Steel Europe trade unions, said its advisers had recommended it oppose the current business plan because it prioritises shareholder dividends over the long-term development of the joint venture.Thyssenkrupp was not immediately available to comment.Tata Steel Netherlands reached a preliminary agreement with Dutch unions in March, after promising job losses would be limited to between 300 and 400 supporting functions while excluding any forced redundancies until 2026.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-05-08,"Tata Steel is facing a twin-Bhushan problem.One, it has moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against National Company Law Tribunal's order asking lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel to consider a bid by Liberty House.Even in the case of Bhushan Steel, which it has all but bagged under the insolvency process, Tata Steel is facing tough times. It is facing resistance from the employees of its acquired company. A story by Economic Times  says that Bhushan Steel employees in the Odisha plant have resisted moves by Tata Steel to take over the facility.Both the Bhushan companies belonged to the Delhi-based Singhal family.Bhushan Power & SteelTata Steel had emerged as the clear leader in the race for Bhushan Power & Steel, after its bid emerged higher than that of JSW Steel, the only other company to take part in the auction.But Liberty House joined the race as a late entrant and offered Rs 1,500 crore more to Bhushan Power &  Steel's lenders, over Tata Steel's 17,000 crore.The Tata company is clearly unhappy that a bid has been allowed past the deadline. The race is far from over, much to its charging.When contacted by Moneycontrol, a Tata Steel representative said: ""No comments as the matter is sub-judice.""Bhushan Power owes banks over Rs 48,000 crore.Bhushan SteelOn March 22, Tata Steel was declared as the successful resolution applicant by lenders of Bhushan Steel.The Tata company had out bid JSW Steel to emerge the winner in the auction of Bhushan Steel.Experts say that transfer of control of the asset could take at least six months, and it is unclear who is responsible for running the company in the interim.The interim period thus can be tricky for the buyer - here Tata Steel - as it takes steps to take over the assets.The report indicated that officials of Tata Steel are being prevented from entering the Bhushan Steel plant located in Dhenkanal, in Odisha.It hasn't helped that rumours bound of a possible job cut, making the plant employees jittery.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-04-24,"""We do not claim to be more unselfish, more generous or more philanthropic than other people. But we think we started on sound and straightforward business principles, considering the interests of the shareholders our own, and the health and welfare of the employees the sure foundation of our prosperity. ""The words were uttered memorably by Jamsetji Tata, the man who broke new ground for Indian entrepreneurship much before the term was coined. Some time back we brought to you a podcast about how the idea of the great big Indian business family continues to endure at a time of brash, young but uproariously successful ideas. And no business exemplifies this resilience better than Tata Sons.As we mentioned in the last podcast, entrenched family businesses are more politically savvy than new players and understand how to adapt to India's ever evolving social and entrepreneurial landscape.Even as two of Tata's flagship companies, Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel Europe, navigate international negotiations currently, the headlines today state that Tata Sons has appointed former foreign secretary S Jaishankar as president, global corporate affairs. This is clearly a well-thought out move and bodes well for the company. He will be overseeing Tata group’s global corporate affairs and international strategy development.In an official statement, Jaishankar said that he looks forward to working with an iconic institution known for its value-based leadership.His statement conveying in not so many words that a pioneering business enterprise evokes more than just numbers.So let us today, talk of a success story that is not just about products but legacies. A legacy which now includes TCS, the freshly minted USD 100 billion company. It is also time for us to acknowledge on this podcast the irrefutable fact that even those of us who have never worked for a Tata company have been touched in some way by its services, products and messaging.Tata Sons, the family that pioneered CSRMany of us still remember the vintage ads about their steel legacy, where the Tatas used this key phrase, ""We also make steel.""It was in 1988, that the Tatas first ran an ad on Doordarshan, not about a product but nation building. It showed us the impact conscientious corporate policies have on employees and even consumers. That ad captured in a few seconds the idealism of the founding fathers of Tata Sons. 1988 was also the year, Tata Steel became the only integrated steel company in the world outside Japan to win the Deming Application Prize for excellence in Total Quality Management.The ad with the punch line, ""We also make steel"" also summed up what we would come to understand in the years to come as CSR (or corporate social responsibility).The Tatas in a way pioneered the idea of philanthropy being intrinsic to corporate philosophy.And so it turns out that the term family in the case of Tatas has always had a broader meaning. And as was evident in the famous ad, The Tatas did not just build a steel plant. They built a city for their employees where there are more amenities than some of the biggest metro cities in India. The city has multiple academies for varied sport disciplines, golf courses, a hospital, leafy avenues, stadiums, a local power utility and a lot more.Jamshedpur or Tata Nagar was built in 1907 and today the Tatas' contribution to its infrastructure even includes an Rs 100 crore, 11-km highway. This level of investment in human capital is what lasting legacies are built of. And that is why, too many Tata employees, being part of the Tata family means that often succeeding generations also end up working for the company.  And yes, Tata Steel hasn’t seen a day of strike since 1928.CSR with constant diversification and global dominanceAnd we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what the Tata family stands for.Even as first generation entrepreneurs in India challenge entrenched business houses with out of the box ideas like Flipkart, old warriors like Tata Sons are striving to remain relevant by diversifying and exploring new avenues constantly. Tata sons continue to exemplify the undiluted power of a family owned business, having weathered storms of all kinds through the decades.And the Tata family is thriving still in a country far different from the one it was first conceived in. Many Tata companies have achieved global prominence over the years as they redefine their skill profiles to suit the ever evolving business environment. Tata Communications for instance is a leading international wholesale voice provider and Tata Motors is among the top ten commercial vehicle manufacturers in the world.While Tata Steel, the heritage brand of the Tate empire is among the top fifteen best steel companies, TCS is the second largest IT services company in the world. Tata Global Beverages continues to be the second-largest tea company in the world and Tata Chemicals is the world’s second-largest manufacturer of soda ash.The Tatas originally arrived in Mumbai from Navsarii, Gujarat and the first man in the family to strike gold was Jamshedji Tata.Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata was not just the patriarch of the Tata business empire but the father of modern Indian entrepreneurship.It was in 1868, that Jamshedji Tata founded the Tata group which went on to become a global enterprise, comprising over 100 independent operating companies operating in more than 100 countries across six continents. In 2016-17, the cumulative revenue of Tata companies, was USD 100.39 billion.According to the Tata website, there are 29 publicly-listed Tata enterprises today with a combined market capitalisation of about USD 130.13 billion (as on March 31, 2017). Tata companies with significant scale include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Teleservices, Titan, Tata Communications and Indian Hotels.The original vision that fuelled the conception and expansion of industries of steel, hydro-power, hospitality and airlines went on to create path breaking entities. Entities such as TCS, India’s first software company, and Tata Motors, which has to its credit  India’s first indigenously developed car, the Tata Indica and the smart city car, the Tata Nano.Tata Sons however continues to be the principal investment holding company. A remarkable aspect of this story is that sixty-six percent of the equity share capital of Tata Sons is controlled by philanthropic trusts supportive of art and culture, education, health, livelihood generation etc.The majority shareholders of Tata Sons, have routinely endowed institutions to research science and technology, medicine, social studies and the performing arts. The trusts also provide aid and assistance to non-government organisations working to improve education, health care and livelihoods.The company's mission statement in its own words continues to be based on, customer-centricity, innovation, entrepreneurship, trustworthiness and values-driven business operations. All this while the company balances the interests of diverse stakeholders including shareholders, employees and civil society.Jamshedji Tata, the man in a hurry to build an aspirational business ideaHis most important contribution though was to create an aspirational idea of India where Indian entrepreneurship could claim its place proudly on the global stage with other industrialised nations.He was energised by the patriotic idealism of a man who not only wanted to create an empire but to root it in humanism.  That he envisioned the House of Tatas spanning generations at a time when India was colonised and was crushed by poverty is even more remarkable.On March 3, 1839, in Navsari, Gujarat, he was born to Nusserwanji Tata, into a family of Parsee priests. His father paved the way for him by breaking away from the tradition of priesthood and establishing a banking business. Jamsetji was enrolled at Elphinstone College, from where he graduated in 1858 and soon he joined the small firm that his father ran. He was just 20 and soon began to learn about commodities, markets, trading and banking.In 1868, aged 29 he started a trading company with a capital of Rs 21,000. Already a visionary, he acquired a defunct oil mill in Chinchpokli, in Bombay, and converted it into a cotton mill. Even though, he sold the mill two years later, he went to England, to exhaustively study the Lancashire cotton trade.In 1874, Jamsetji founded the Central India Spinning, Weaving and Manufacturing Company, with a seed capital of Rs 1.5 lakh. Three years later, his dream project. Empress Mills came into existence in Nagpur. He was 37. From about 1880 to his death in 1904, Jamsetji devoted himself to three of his big dreams, setting up an iron and steel company, generating hydroelectric power, and creating a world-class scientific institution.He died without fulfilling these dreams but his spadework resulted in future generations giving shape to his unrealised ideas. His heirs would remember his heroic efforts to build a steel company despite the odds presented by a scornful British empire and road blocks at every step. Eight years after his death, the first ingot of steel rolled out off the plant's production line. The year was 1912 and helming his vision were now his son Dorab and cousin RD Tata.Jamshedji Tata's encompassing vision for the extended Tata familyIn his lifetime, Jamsetji also laid the foundation for the company's well-known worker friendly policies by offering his employees shorter working hours, well-lit and properly ventilated working spaces, and provident fund and gratuity benefits even before they had become mandatory in the West.We have already mentioned Jamshedpur and it was Jamsetji who had visualised the concept of an idyllic workers' township at a steel plant five years before even a site for the enterprise had been chosen. He had visualised wide streets planted with shady trees, plenty of space for lawns and gardens, areas for football, hockey and parks. The secular nationalist also wanted spaces earmarked for temples, mosques and churches. It was poetic perfection that when his vision became a reality years after his death, the city that was built would be named after him and called Jamshedpur.Inspired by his dream to encourage India's brightest minds with the JN Tata Endowment in 1892, the inheritors of this legacy established Tata scholarships. They would go on to touch so many lives that by 1924, two out of every five Indians in the Indian Civil Service happened to be Tata scholars.To establish an Indian Institute of Science, Jamsetji had set aside Rs 30 lakh of his money, had even drawn a blueprint and beseeched the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, and Swami Vivekananda for their literal and ideological support. But despite these efforts, he did not live long enough to see the Indian Institute of Science come up in Bangalore in 1911.The hydroelectric project too was completed after his demise. Among the dreams he lived long enough to realise was the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay. He wanted to build a world class hotel showcasing Indian hospitality after being denied entry into one of the city's hotels. It cost Rs 4.21 crore by the time it was finished and was the first building in Bombay to use electricity and as the trivia on Tata website states, this was the first hotel in the country to have American fans, German elevators, Turkish baths, English butlers and whole lot more.The house of Tata that we know today was hence built on the shoulders of this man whose founding ideals were then carried forward and interpreted by succeeding generations making the family business more than just about the immediate family. As he wanted, the name Tata today stands for not just cutting edge entrepreneurship but philanthropy. He passed away in Germany in 1904 and the chairmanship of the Tata group passed to the elder of his two sons, Sir Dorab Tata.Apart from displaying their entrepreneurial verve, many Tata scions like Sir Ratanji Tata: Jamsetji Tata's younger son, have used their resources to touch, change and enhance lives of the less privileged. It was Ratanji who created a trust fund for ""the advancement of learning and for the relief of human suffering and other works of public utility.""The Sir Ratan Tata Trust is today the second largest of the Tata trusts. Another Tata scion Naval Tata also contributed liberally to the fields of business, sports administration and labour relations.On the other end of the spectrum was the unstoppable energy of JRD Tata (Chairman, Tata Sons: 1938 – 1991) who put India on the aviation map and pioneered civil aviation in the subcontinent in 1932 by launching the airline now known as Air India.More than just another family businessPodcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-02-17,"Tata Steel has emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a surprise bid of Rs 35,000 crore. JSW Steel, which was the favourite till the end of the race, was second placed with a bid of Rs 29,700 crore.A senior bank executive aware of the development confirmed the allotment to Tata Steel and the bid amount.Bhushan Steel is one of the 12 large corporate accounts identified by the Reserve Bank of India that accounted for almost 25 percent of exposure to bad loans for the entire banking sector.The Neeraj Singal-led company had accumulated debt of over Rs 50,000 crore, of which bank dues amounted to around Rs 44,000 crore.“We are happy with bid offer and this is a good sign. We have provided over 50 percent. The haircut is about 35 percent,” the banker said.An announcement may be made later tonight, or tomorrow, another source from the industry added.The development follows a meeting between the lenders of Bhushan Steel and the resolution professional earlier in the day today. According to reports, the liquidation value of Bhushan Steel stood at Rs 15,000 crore.Tata Steel and JSW Steel had submitted their bids on February 3. Initially, Tata Steel's bid was said to close to Rs 24,000 crore.State Bank of India has one of the largest exposures to the debt-laden company at around Rs 6,000 crore, including external commercial borrowings.

2018-10-08,"Tata Steel said its consolidated steel output remained almost flat at 7.33 million tonne (MT) during the second quarter of the ongoing financial year.During July-September, 2017-18, the company's output on consolidated basis stood at 7.26 MT, Tata Steel said in a statement.Sales during the reported quarter also came down to 7.22 MT from 7.38 MT in the year-ago period, registering a fall of about 2 percent.Tata Steel India produced 3.27 MT in July-September 2018 as against 3.20 MT during the same period a year ago. Its sales were at 3.18 MT as compared to 3.08 MT in July-September 2017, the statement said.""Automotive and special products sales grew 17 percent year-on-year...mainly driven by higher demand from the auto sector,"" it said.Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL), which was recently acquired by Tata Steel, reported over 23 percent jump in its output at 1.05 MT for the reported quarter as compared to 0.85 MT in the year-ago period.BSL's sales also rose 10 percent to 1.14 MT from 1.03 MT in the year-ago quarter.Tata Steel Europe's output fell to 2.46 MT from 2.60 MT in September quarter of 2017-18.In Europe, the sales also dipped to 2.25 MT from 2.60 MT in July-September 2017.During the quarter, the ""production was impacted by shutdowns for ongoing upgradation programme, annual maintenances in seasonally weaker quarter; two unplanned outages also impacted production"", the company said.Tata Steel South-East Asia reported an output of 0.55 MT as against 0.61 MT in the year-ago period.The sales were at 0.65 MT as compared to 0.67 MT in September quarter of 2017-18.""The production improved quarter-on-quarter but was lower year-on-year at both Tata Steel Thailand and Nat Steel.

2018-10-30,"Soon after taking over as the Chairman of Tata Sons, N Chandrasekaran shared his vision for the $100 billion conglomerate. He wanted each of its companies to be 'top performers' in their respective sectors.The vision also included simplifying the structure of the group. There are the big three  - Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Steel and Tata Motors. The rest will be organised around clusters, which include infrastructure, defence, consumer goods and travel.Vistara and AirAsia India are the two companies that fall in the travel cluster. The Tatas hold 51 percent in Vistara, its joint venture with Singapore Airlines, and Tata Sons owns 49 percent in AirAsia India.The two airlines are far from meeting Chandrasekaran's ""top performers"" vision.Although Vistara's revenue jumped over 50 percent to Rs 2,228 crore in the 2018 financial year, it still reported a loss of Rs 431 crore. As on September 30, its market share was just 3.8 percent.AirAsia India, on the other hand, recorded its first profitable three-month period  in the fourth quarter of the last financial year. But it's bottomline returned to red in the first quarter of the current financial year and its market share at the end of September was 4.8 percent.The two companies rank just above regional airlines in the market. IndiGo, which had a market share of 40.9 percent at the end of September, continues to be the dominant airline in India.To be fair, the two airlines are relatively new entrants in the market. But in an industry that is rapidly expanding, and when every other peer is focused on garnering market share, Chandrasekaran understands that the Tata's aviation ambitions need a strong push.Enter Jet AirwaysNumerous reports have come up over the last couple of weeks about the Tatas' interest in Jet Airways. Last week, it was reported, that Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal had called up on Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, and met senior officials of Tata Sons, including Chandrasekaran himself.""Yes, it does seem that discussion have taken place. One can question why the Tatas want to own three loss-making airlines. But that is unless they want to follow Chandrasekaran's policy of having substantial market share in any business the Group is in,"" said a senior airline executive.Another senior executive from the industry said: ""If the Tatas do buy Jet Airways, it would be to scale up Vistara.""Vistara had planned to launch its first international flight by the end of this year, but that may get postponed to next year. While its services, including its in-flight menu, have a large following, the airline's network is limited and its fleet of 22 aircraft is small.Jet Airways, on the other hand, has a considerable presence on the ground with its 124 aircraft that do nearly 700 flights a day.  The airline flies to and from 66 destinations and has a market share of 15.8 percent.Surely, Jet Airways' debt pile of nearly Rs 6,000 crore is worrisome. The airline is losing Rs 10 crore a day. And more importantly, Goyal has shown no signs of letting go of the reins.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-07-20,"Tata Steel and JSW Steel are not just competing to become India’s largest steelmaker. The two companies also seem to be in a race to have the highest number of crorepati executives.These are executives with an annual salary of Rs 1.02 crore or more.JSW Steel, which will again inch ahead of Tata Steel in terms of capacity – after the Monnet Ispat buy, has also taken the lead in terms of the crorepati executives.The Sajjan Jindal company now has 79 executives who earn more than Rs 1.02 crore a year, compared to Tata Steel’s tally of 73 executives.The growth in these top-paid executives has been higher in JSW Steel, which had 41 executives under the bracket in the 2017 financial year. Tata Steel, on the other hand, had 49 executives earnings at least Rs 1.02 crore.However, the median salary is higher in Tata Steel. While in the Tata company the median salary was Rs 9.45 lakh in the 2018 financial year, in JSW Steel the median level came at Rs 6.25 lakh. But at 9.46 percent, the increase in the median salary was higher in the Jindal company. In Tata Steel, the rise in the median salary was 8.78 percent from a year earlier.Both the companies have pruned their workforce. While Tata Steel’s workforce reduced marginally from 34,989 to 34,072, that of JSW Steel dipped from 11,848 to 11,619 over the one-year period.Companies in India are required to report the remuneration of their top employees as per the Companies Act. The requirement was amended two years ago. While earlier the companies were required to report details of all employees earning Rs 60 lakh a year and more, the cut-off was later increased to Rs 1.02 crore.Record yearThe handsome gains in executives’ pay come during a year when both companies posted stellar financial numbers.Tata Steel’s revenues increased by 13.3 percent, and its bottom line was back in the black at Rs 17,763 crore. Similarly, JSW Steel’s revenue went up by 16 percent, and net profits jumped by 29 percent.The new financial year has been marked by aggressive steps taken by the two steelmakers to expand inorganically, both within India and overseas. In India, the two companies have found success in the sale of distressed assets, which has led to a constantly changing pecking order.Once the formal order comes from the National Company Law Tribuanl (NCLT) on the Monnet Ispat acquisition, JSW Steel’s annual capacity will increase to 19.6 million tons from the present 18.1. Just a month earlier, Tata Steel had become the largest in the country after its Bhushan Steel acquisition, which added 5.6 million tons to its annual capacity of 13 million tons.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Let us see what happens. It is a great opportunity for anyone in the steel industry who has the appetite and ambition to grow in India,"" he said while speaking about Tata Steel bidding for some stressed steel assets facing National Company Law Tribunal proceedings under Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code.Tata Steel has bid for companies like Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel and Electrosteel Steels.Narendran said the company's Kalinganagar project in Odisha has shaped up well and it is in full production. It is also the right time to plan for the second phase which is already approved by the board.The Tata Steel board has approved the next phase of capacity expansion in Kalinganagar to 8 million tonnes per annum from 3 million tonnes at present.The project will cost the company Rs 23,500 crore and will be completed within 48 months.The board has also approved a rights issue for an amount up to Rs 12,800 crore.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-01-01,"Tata Steel today expressed hope that the new year is expected to be slightly better compared to the last two years as stability has returned to the steel sector globally.Addressing a gathering on the new year, TV Narendran, CEO and Managing Director of Tata Steel said 2017 was somewhat better compared to the preceding two years despite challenges.In 2014, he said, Tata Steel had dealt with some of the challenges relating to the closure of its mines because of change in regulations, while in 2015 China had increased its export volumes globally, including India, which created a challenging atmosphere.However, Tata Steel continued to perform and grew during this period despite the odds, he said.""Despite these challenges in the last two years, Tata Steel has continued to invest and has grown not only in the works but also in the township of Jamshedpur to improve facilities during this period,"" Narendran said.Recently, he said, the Tata Group Chairman and Board members had visited Jamshedpur and they were ""quite happy"" with what they saw.Emphasizing on the need for competitiveness, he said that going forward, the competitiveness of Jamshedpur plant will get challenged after 2030 when the mines it has at its disposal today would be put up for auction.Later, talking to reporters, Narendran said there is a stability in the steel sector globally and import of steel from China has come down to five million tonnes from 10 million tonnes because of anti-dumping duty and other temporary measures taken by the government.Referring to the Kalinganagar project in Odisha, Narendran said the board has given green signal to start the second phase of work there, which has achieved 100 percent production level within a year of commission.Describing the government’s action as positive in view of demand, he said the consumption of steel would increase with infrastructure development in the country and also the logistics cost, which was currently on the higher side compared to other countries, would come down with improvement in infrastructure.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-02-26,"The race for Bhushan Power & Steel has just got longer, and possibly more competitive.In a surprise for its competitors, Liberty House’s bid for Bhushan Power & Steel has got a fresh lease of life after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today accepted an appeal against the rejection of its proposal.The resolution professional (RP) and Committee of Creditors had last week rejected Liberty House’s bid for Bhushan Power as it was submitted after the deadline had passed, on February 8.But the UK-based company had approached the NCLT on February 23, asking that its bid should be considered.According to sources, Liberty House on Monday backed its appeal with a  proposal to turnaround the operations of Bhushan Power & Steel. It also contended that its bid was higher than that of Tata Steel.Till now, Tata Steel had been leading the race, with a bid of  Rs 17,000 crore against JSW Steel’s Rs 13,500 crore.Not surprisingly, Tata Steel’s counsel told the NCLT’s Principal Bench in Delhi – hearing the appeal – that Liberty House’s case should be dismissed prima facie. But the judge ruled that the Bench would like to hear in detail what each respondent has to say.The Bench will now hear the three stakeholders – resolution professional, Liberty House and Tata Steel  - on March 5, after asking them to file submissions through an affidavit.“The matter is sub-judice,” a spokesperson of Liberty House told Moneycontrol.“The Tribunal has heard us and heard the RP's counsel as well as Tata's counsel, who intervened. The Tribunal has deemed it fit that the respondents put their submissions on affidavit explaining conduct of the insolvency process. The parties will now be heard on the 5th. We are hopeful that our bona fide will stand out,” added the spokesperson.Industry executives said the development was unprecedented and would have bearing on rest of the auctions. “This is surprising. Almost everyone expected Liberty’s appeal to be dismissed,” said an official from a steel company.Bhushan Power & Steel had accumulated nearly Rs 50,000 crore in debts and was referred to the NCLT last year.Apart from the Bhushan company, Liberty House is also in contention in the auction of Amtek Auto and ABG Shipyard.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-09-26,"Tata Steel is likely to put in Rs 300-400 crore in FY20 into Usha Martin's specialty steel division that it has agreed to acquire, to further improve the operating margins, a report said.In one of the largest debt resolution case outside the NCLT, the Usha Martin (USL) board had on September 22 signed an agreement with Tata Steel (TSL) to sell the Kolkata-based firm's steel and wire rope business for a cash consideration of up to Rs 4,300-4,700 crore in a slump sale.USL's Jamshedpur-based steel division has one million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of alloy-based manufacturing capacity in the long products segment.""TSL will help in improving the blended EBITDA/tonne (operating margins per tonne) of the acquired business to Rs 8,000 per tonne by FY21, from the current Rs 6,800 per tonne on the back of captive coal supplies, optimisation of sales mix and other operational synergies,"" India Ratings said in a report.It expects the acquired division to contribute a modest 3.5 percent to TSL's absolute EBITDA in FY20 for domestic business.The rating agency also assumes TSL to incur an additional Rs 300-400 crore of capex in FY20 to further improve the division's EBITDA/tonne.The agency expects total cash outflows on account of capital expenditure and acquisitions to remain below Rs 9,000 crore in FY19, with a large portion of the acquisition outflows to occur only in FY20.India Ratings said that the acquisition is credit neutral for TSL, adding that proposed acquisition will lead to a modest increase in TSL's net leverage to about 4.0x in FY20, against 3.3x in FY18.It can be noted that global rating agencies S&P and Moody's on September 25 had said the purchase is credit positive for TSL as it widens its product portfolio to the high margin long products segments, where the Tatas are not strong now, without impacting the company's financial profile or leverage as the deal will be an all-cash one.India Ratings also said the proposed acquisition appears to be a good strategic fit to TSL, aligning well with its existing location and vicinity of captive iron ore mines. The iron ore and coal mines are adjacent to TSL's existing projects, located primarily in eastern India.It will increase TSL's India capacity to 19.3 mtpa, from 18.3 mtpa, making it the largest steel company by domestic production.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-05-30,"The company law appellate tribunal today asked Tata Steel if it will clear the statutory dues like income tax and GST of Bhushan Steel, a company it had acquired in the insolvency proceedings earlier this month.The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), hearing appeals against the acquisition filed by Bhushan Steel's founding Singal family and the firm's operational creditor Larsen and Toubro, asked Tata Steel to submit a statement of statutory dues of the company.The two member bench headed by NCLAT Chairman, Justice S J Mukhopadhaya also asked the Resolution Professional, which oversaw the auction of Bhushan Steel, to state how much would L&T get from Rs 532 crore offered to all the operational creditors.Bhushan Steel owed its lenders about Rs 56,000 crore and was among the 12 big loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India last year to undergo insolvency under the new bankruptcy law.Tata Steel offered Rs 35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel. It would pay another Rs 1,200 crore over next 12 months to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.After the entire exercise, Tata would hold 75 per cent stake and banks would get 12.27 per cent. Singal family would be left with 2.5 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent would be public holding.While L&T wants to recover its Rs 956 crore dues, Singal family has made a Rs 28,592 crore counter-offer.During the proceedings, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi opposed the Rs 28,592 crore offer by Neeraj Singal. ""This Rs 28,592 crore offer in 14 years is a spoiler,"" he said.Meanwhile, senior advocate S Ganesh appearing for Singal submitted that Tata Steel was ineligible to bid for Bhushan Steel under section 29 A of IBC.The section mandates that a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more is ineligible for submitting a resolution plan. Tata Steel UK, a foreign subsidiary of Tata Steel, was fined by an English Court in February 2018, he added.The appellate tribunal has listed the matter on July 3 for next hearing.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-10-25,"Tata Steel Thursday indicated that it was unlikely to raise its Rs 17,000-crore bid for debt-ridden Bhushan Power and Steel.Around 90 percent of lenders of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) has voted in favour of JSW Steel's bid of more than Rs 19,000 crore, sources told PTI last week.When asked if Tata Steel was still keen on Bhushan Power and Steel, company MD T V Narendran said, ""At the price we have bid.""Tata Steel reportedly has objected to lenders of BPSL finalising a bid of its rival JSW Steel.""What we have said is that process has been compromised. It is not about who bid. Because earlier when we went to NCLAT we felt that Liberty Steel had bid after the last date which we felt was a compromise of the process. JSW has also bid after the last date so that's our only point that the process has been compromised. There is nothing against any of our peers,"" Narendran explained.""So, our agony is that the process has been compromised and court will decide based on it immediately,"" he added.Tata Steel last month submitted before the NCLAT that lenders of BPSL permitted rival JSW Steel to change basic parameters of bids after submission.JSW Steel had revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to little over Rs 19,000 crore.Bhushan Power and Steel was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the RBI for NCLT proceedings.When asked will there be any competition threat with the world's largest steel maker ArcelorMittal planning to enter Indian steel market, ""That's fine. I think we encourage good competition. We compete ArcelorMittal in Europe, so we can compete with them in India as well. I think we are confident in our own equity with our customers.""Narendran further said that the company expects to complete the Usha Martin deal within next six months.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-12-08,"Germany's Thyssenkrupp and India's Tata Steel are close to deciding who will lead their planned European steel joint venture, four people familiar with the matter said on December 7.Settling on the venture's leadership has been delayed by a strategy crisis and change of CEO at the German industrial conglomerate, which has said it would split into two companies.The holdup has riled the Thyssenkrupp workforce. A labour leader on December 5 said there would be ""trouble"" if the matter was not resolved soon.Andreas Goss, head of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit, is the front runner to become chief executive of the combined entity, which will be Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, the people said.The new company will have around 48,000 workers and about 17 billion euros ($19.4 billion) in sales, with production facilities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.Goss, seen as well connected in the industry, has led Thyssenkrupp's steel division since 2014. The unit's adjusted operating profit rose by 26 percent to 687 million euros over the past financial year.His appointment would further strengthen Thyssenkrupp's position in the 50-50 venture, which already includes a greater share of proceeds should the entity be listed on the stock exchange, which is widely expected.Signed in June, the planned entity still needs European antitrust approval, which is expected towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. The groups might have to divest assets to secure approval, sources have previously said.Hans Fischer, chief executive of Tata Steel's European subsidiary, is also likely to join the venture's management board, the people said, adding it was unclear how many seats the board would have.Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in June said the joint venture's management board would consist of six members, shared equally between both groups.That number could be reduced to four to give a more focused structure to the entity, which will be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the people said.A decision will be announced very soon, the people said. Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said last month a decision on the joint venture's leadership would be made before Christmas.""The joint venture would have a two-tier management structure comprising a management board and a supervisory board,"" a Tata Steel spokesman said.""Both boards would have equal representation from Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel,"" he said, adding further announcements will be made ""in due course"".When asked about the issue, a spokesman for Thyssenkrupp referred back to Kerkhoff's remarks.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-08-01,"Tata Steel has reasons to feel slighted, twice over.In February, it had emerged as the highest bidder in the auction of Bhushan Power & Steel after its bid of Rs 18,000 crore came on top of JSW Steel's Rs 11,000 crore . It was even selected as the preferred bidder by Bhushan's lenders.But just when the company was about to touch the finishing line, Liberty House entered the race and called time. Worse, it offered a higher bid of Rs 18,500 crore.A couple of months later in July, it looked like the Tata company again had its hands around the Bhushan trophy. The Bhushan lenders selected Tata Steel as the H1 bidder, as they had questions over Liberty House's funding.The banks were set to vote on the Tata company's bid and give it the stamp of approval. But just then, JSW Steel re-entered the scene with a revised offer that was higher than Tata Steel's and matched that of Liberty House.""It's not fair,"" senior Tata Steel officials told dailies off the record. ""There was no concept of a re-bid,"" they claimed.That's not all. Another setback was in store on Wednesday, when the National Company Law Tribunal asked the lenders to invite fresh bids, setting August 6 as the deadline.The question now on everyone's lips is — ""Will Tata Steel approach the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order? It may. But even if it doesn't, it won't be surprising as the court may say that maximising the value is the main intention of an auction,"" said an executive from the industry.That will be music for the banks' ears.Happier lendersThe lenders couldn't be happier.Bhushan Power & Steel owes them Rs 49,700 crore. If Tata Steel had won the auction, then its Rs 17,000-crore bid would have meant a haircut of over 65 percent.All the three bidders have promised to invest an additional Rs 7,000 crore in Bhushan Power's operations.But with JSW Steel's sweetening the offer, and the NCLAT directive for fresh bids, the banks can be rightful in hoping for a lower haircut.JSW Steel's interestThere was no inkling that JSW Steel intended to revise its bids. In fact, everyone thought that it was no longer interested in Bhushan Power.The company had also bid for Bhushan Steel, which is now under the control of Tata Steel. Something similar was expected to happen with Bhushan Power too.A few day ago, at the press conference to announce its first quarterly results — or at its AGM a day before — none of the company's top officials gave an indication of what was coming.So why did JSW Steel suddenly change its mind?In reality, it may not have been sudden.The only success for the Sajjan Jindal company in the distressed asset sale has been in the form of Monnet Ispat. Bhushan Steel had slipped out of the hands. What remained was Essar Steel.But the auction of Essar Steel has been oft delayed, and is presently with the NCLAT which is expected to next week give its order on the eligibility of ArcelorMittal and Numetal. JSW Steel had joined the auction in its second round. But as things stand now, there is no clear view on how things will pan out in the case of Essar Steel.""Essar Steel is taking time. So Bhushan Power was the only opportunity left. The revised offer is one attempt in exploring opportunities,"" said an executive.Bhushan Power, which has a capacity of 3 million tons a year, could make the crucial difference as Tata Steel and JSW Steel compete to become the largest steelmaker in India. As of now, JSW Steel is slightly ahead of Tata Steel after the Monnet Ispat acquisition took the Jindal company's capacity to 19.6 million tons, a million ton more than the Tata company's.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-07-27,"In a fresh twist to the auction of Bhushan Power & Steel, JSW has submitted a revised offer of over Rs 18,500 crore to buy the stressed company. The Committee of Creditors, which met in Delhi on July 27, has consequently asked for fresh bids by July 31.Sources told Moneycontrol that Liberty House will put in a revised bid by then.The JSW Steel offer trumps the current proposal of Tata Steel and Liberty House.While Tata Steel had offered Rs 17,000 crore, Liberty House’s offer was at Rs 18,500 crore. All the three companies have promised to invest Rs 7,000 crore in the operations of Bhushan Power & Steel.“The JSW Steel offer is above what Liberty House has offered,” an executive from the industry said.The move by JSW Steel has surprised the industry as the Sajjan Jindal-company had taken a backseat after its bid in the first round was trumped by Tata Steel.JSW had initially offered Rs 11,000 crore.“The company has possibly made a revised bid because it is unsure how the Essar Steel auction will pan out,” said another executive.JSW had teamed up with the Numetal consortium in the second round of auction for Essar Steel. But the resolution process has been delayed with both, Numetal and ArcelorMittal, approaching the NCLAT over the eligibility issue. The NCLAT is expected to issue an order in the coming weeks.NCLAT orderOn July 17, the NCLAT had stayed the meeting of Committee of Creditors, which was set to vote on Tata Steel’s bid for Bhushan Power & Steel.Bhushan Power's operations creditors had alleged that the resolution professional hadn’t allowed their representative to attend the lenders meeting.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

TSL will subsequently acquire a 72.65 percent equity stake in Bhushan (Steel),"" Fitch said.TSL's projected steelmaking capacity will increase to 23mtpa with the Bhushan acquisition and including TSL's own 5mtpa capacity expansion scheduled to be completed in 2022, it said.This is in line with management's intention of doubling capacity in India from 13 MTPA in the next five years. Bhushan's main plant is relatively close, about 150 km away from TSL's Kalinganagar plant in Odisha in eastern India. Bhushan's plant is underutilised, producing around 3.5mtpa currently.TSL believes its turnaround plan will enable the plant to reach close to 100 percent utilisation in two years, it added.Bhushan's plant, unlike TSL's, does not benefit from use of captive raw materials currently. However, TSL envisages gains from improvement in operating metrics and from unified marketing and procurement.Bhushan's product mix is enhanced by downstream facilities like its cold-rolling mill and galvanizing units. TSL also has the option to increase capacity at Bhushan's site in the future, which is useful given the significant time required to set up a green field plant in India.The BSL acquisition will enable TSL to improve its domestic market share, but Fitch estimates it will raise TSL's leverage, in terms of net debt to EBITDA, to 4x over the next two to three years from around 3x at end-March 2018.It said TSL's net debt will increase by around Rs 35,000 crore due to the acquisition, excluding additional working capital debt at Bhushan.""We assume additional EBITDA of around INR45 billion in the second year following the acquisition, based on an output of 5 million tonnes and an EBITDA per tonne of around Rs 9,000, based on TSL successfully improving operations at Bhushan to near-optimum levels within two years,"" the Fitch statement said.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-10-29,"Prashant Jhawar, former chairman of Usha Martin, who had earlier disapproved the sale of steel business to Tata Steel, will back the resolution in the upcoming shareholders' meeting slated for the next month. Basant Kumar Jhawar and his son Prashant own 25.5 per cent stake in steel wire maker Usha Martin.""We had earlier welcomed the possible involvement of the Tatas in the management of Usha Martin's steel division resulting in value for all stakeholders.""In order to facilitate this, we have instructed our lawyers to support the resolution for the sale of the steel division of Usha Martin to the Tata Sponge Iron Ltd (TSIL), at the forthcoming shareholders meeting,"" Prashant Jhawar said in a statement.The shareholders' meeting is scheduled for November 10.According to sources: ""This does not indicate any settlement within the family. The support to the deal is only an acknowledgement of TSIL's ability to run the steel business"".Concerns on the current management of the Usha Martin remain, the sources added.According to them, the Basant-Prashant Jhawar promoter faction of Usha Martin had not given their approval to Tata Steel's offer for acquiring the company's steel business at the meeting of board of directors held last month and had sought details on the utilisation of funds.""We have also conveyed our decision to the lead banker, the State Bank of India. We are doing this even though our concerns over specific utilisation of sales proceeds towards repayment of term loan, working capital, unsecured /operating creditors and more particularly the contingent liabilities in the residual business as listed on page 65 of the annual report of UML for year ending 31 st March 2018, remain unaddressed,"" Jhawar further said in the statement.The total contingent liabilities listed stand around Rs 860 crore, including claims from the Jharkhand government pertaining to irregularities in the mining operations, allegedly carried out by the present management, he said.""We believe, should such claims require settlement it may result in additional debt being loaded on to the residual business. It would be in the best interest of all stakeholders, if the management and the board come out with specific plans to find a resolution.""Our concern on the above as well as possible diversion of funds remains unaddressed. As stated earlier, we are pleased to extend a warm welcome to the reputed house of Tatas to run the steel division founded by my father, Basant Kumar Jhawar,"" he said.Jhawar also exuded confidence that TSIL will run the assets in the way they deserve to be administered and enhance the legacy.""Basant Kumar Jhawar has always worked in the interest of all stakeholders and this event is not an exception, thereby supporting the resolution and acquisition of assets,"" he added.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-06-17,"Can collective benefits triumph over self interests?Answer to the question lies at the heart of Tata Steel Europe's merger with Thyssenkrupp's European steel business.Labour unions of Thyssenkrupp, Tata Steel's Dutch and UK operations have voiced their individual concerns about the merger conditions.The labour representatives at the German company aired concerns after earnings of Tata Steel Europe dropped even as Thyssenkrupp's numbers grew. Would the differing performances mean that the German operations will have to support the UK business, which has suffered due to cheap imports?At Tata Steel, the workers in the UK facilities are concerned if the merger will lead to shut down of any facilities, eventually leading to job losses. The doubts have persisted despite Tata Steel promising limited job losses, after the merger.The Dutch facilities have managed to ensure an exclusive provision within the merger. Tata Steel has guaranteed that the Dutch operations would have control over their profits and effectively continue as an independent company.This hasn't gone well with the counterparts at Thyssenkrupp. German labour union representatives have indicated that they could demand the same. “But then a joint venture no longer makes sense because every unit would only act on its own,” Reuters quoted a union secretary.""The British, the Dutch and the Germans have their self interests that are larger than the collective benefits. This (the merger) is like a steep hill,"" a senior executive from the industry with considerable experience of working in Europe, told Moneycontrol.The mergerTata Steel Europe and Thyssenkrupp had signed the merger agreement in September, agreeing to create an operation that will be second only to ArcelorMittal in Europe.The formalities were expected to be completed by June, but have been delayed by six months.The two companies had agreed to an equal joint venture, which will also hold debts of Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp.The two sides have emphasised the benefits of the merger, which would lead to 400 million euros of synergy gains. But the sticky point would be the reduction of 4,000 jobs.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

2018-04-15,"With 12.48 million tonne (MT) production, Tata Steel India has recorded highest ever output for the fiscal 2017-18, mainly on the back of robust performance at Kalinganagar plant, according to a company official.This represents nearly 7 per cent higher output compared to 11.68 MT the company had produced in the preceding financial year.""Besides output, there were many firsts this year. It also achieved highest-ever annual sales of 12.13 million tonnes,"" a company spokesperson said.The company had registered a sales of 10.97 MT in financial year 2016-17.For the first time, Tata Steel achieved the landmark of 1 million tonnes of annual exports. It also registered the best automotive sales of 1.86 million tonne, the spokesperson added.The entire value chain played a role in achieving these numbers but ramping up of its Kalinganagar plant was the most crucial factor to enable the company to achieve these milestones, according to the official.At 25.39 million tonnes, the company's combined steel production from three geographies –India, Europe and South East Asia was up by 3.5 per cent in FY 2018 as compared to 24.52 MT in the previous fiscal, due to an improved performance in India and Europe operations.In India, Jamshedpur unit has a capacity of 10 MTPA and Kalinganagar is a 3 MTPA plant.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-10-17,"JSW Steel may have emerged as the favourite to bag Bhushan Power & Steel, but the script may change yet again, as it has often happened in this race for the Delhi-based stressed company.The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) is slated to hear Tata Steel's petition on October 22. The Tata company had challenged National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) April order that had allowed Liberty House to submit its bid, post the deadline.JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Liberty House are the three contenders for Bhushan Power & Steel. The stressed company's lenders had over two days - Monday and Tuesday - voted on JSW Steel's offer, which eventually received over 90 percent of the votes.The Sajjan Jindal-company had revised its bid in August, just before the lenders were to vote on Tata Steel's bid. JSW Steel bid Rs 19,700 crore, trumping the Rs 17,000-crore bid of Tata Steel. The revised bid was much higher than JSW Steel's first offer of Rs 11,000 crore.While Liberty House has bid Rs 17,500 crore, lenders had asked for details on its financing, raising doubts on the offer from the London-based Group.But that too will depend on the outcome of the October 22 hearing.""They would first want to wait for what the Tribunal says before taking the next step,"" an executive from the industry said.At the same time, legal experts said the Committee of Creditors (CoC), consisting of the lenders, will have the last say on the matter. ""After the Essar Steel case, it is clear that all the power now lies in the hands of CoC,"" a senior counsel said.The Supreme Court had asked Numetal and ArcelorMittal to clear dues to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel. This was against the order of the NCLAT, which had deemed Numetal's bid as eligible.The CoC will now have to see to it that Numetal and ArcelorMittal clear the dues within the stipulated time of two weeks, and go ahead with the process.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-07-10,"It looks like the Tata Steel deal was the proverbial last straw that broke the back of investors’ faith in German giant ThyssenKrupp’s CEO Heinrich Hiesinger. Even while Hiesinger was announcing the transaction with Tata Steel’s Chairman N Chandrasekaran at a press conference, the rumour mills were working overtime about his impending exit.The deal took nearly two years to fructify;  the delay in its signing and the way it was structured were just two of the reasons for Hiesinger’s exit. In fact, it was slow progress on several fronts that seems to have cost the CEO his job.The way that pressure was brought to bear on Hiesinger holds some lessons for Indian companies and their stakeholders. Cases of shareholder activism in India have been few and far between, and rarely successful. It may be worth looking more closely at the Thyssen case for inspiration.Activist shareholders Swedish Fund Cevian Capital (18 percent holding in ThyssenKrupp) and Elliott Advisors (less than 3 percent holding) of the US both accused the German company of giving away assets too cheaply.Elliott Advisors felt ThyssenKrupp’s share in the new company should be as high as 80 percent based on the higher profitability of its European steel operations. Elliott, looking at earnings over just the past 12 months, pegged the valuation of ThyssenKrupp’s steel business at 1.9 billion euro more than Tata’s.Goldman Sachs said ThyssenKrupp's business was worth half a billion euros more than what was earlier agreed. Since the time the two groups started talking, Thyssen’s steel business did much better than that of Tata Steel, which seems to have caused differences in perceived value.The activist shareholders were vocal about Hiesinger’s style of operations and the overall complex structure of ThyssenKrupp's companies. The steel-to-submarine major has a number of units, including the highly profitable elevators. Shareholders have been demanding that ThyssenKrupp is made a holding company and the divisions listed separately to unlock value.The funds alleged since Hiesinger took over, Thyssen’s performance deteriorated compared to its peers. ThyssenKrupp's shares fell 28 percent since Hiesinger took office in January 2011.On the face of it, there was support for Hiesinger, but it came from the head of the supervisory board, which under German corporate structure sits on top of the management board and often has a cozy relationship with CEOs. Ulrich Lehner, Chairman of the supervisory board, praised Hiesinger, saying that had freed ThyssenKrupp from an ""existential crisis"" and made the company ready for the future. Without Hiesinger there would be no ThyssenKrupp today, he said.But in the ultimate analysis, there is an important lesson for Indian companies. A dose of shareholder activism could be good news.In India, there have been cases of shareholder activism but in many cases, promoters have managed to get away with their actions thanks to their large stakeholding.Shareholder activism in India can be traced to early 2010 when SEBI made it mandatory to disclose voting policies relating to domestic Mutual Funds. Akzo Nobel was one of the first cases -- shareholders raised their voices against the merger of three promoter-held unlisted entities with Akzo at high valuations. However, the merger went through as it received sufficient votes. Similarly, the Sesa Goa and Sterlite merger, despite being a blatantly skewed deal, went through despite many institutions voting against it.Shareholder activism came to the fore again when an increase in remuneration of certain key executives of Tata Motors was rejected by its shareholders in July 2014. However, when put to vote for a second time in January 2015, shareholders approved the hike.A recent success story is of Raymond where in June 2017 shareholders rejected the sale of JK House at below market price to its promoters.But we have yet to see shareholders raising their voice against company performance or demanding a change in top management, the way we saw in ThyssenKrupp. Promoters are still able to vote out voices of dissent but change will eventually happen: Funds will ask for better performance from company managers.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Both potential buyers have also offered to invest an additional Rs 7,000 crore in the operations of the company.The order comes after the operational creditors of Bhushan Power & Steel approached the NCLAT, alleging that they have not been allowed to represent their case at the CoC meeting.There are as many as 1,700 operational creditors of Bhushan Power & Steel who are asking for their dues to be cleared.The NCLAT has called for a hearing on July 20 and the resolution professional overseeing the auction has been asked to be present for it.The appellate tribunal came down heavily on the resolution professional for not allowing representatives of the operational creditors to participate in the meeting.It has also asked Liberty House for eligibility related compliance under Clause 29A of the Insolvency and Bankrupcty Code.""Liberty has been asked to give declaration that it is 29A compliant,"" said an executive present at the hearing.Bhushan Power & Steel was referred to the NCLT last year after amassing Rs 47,000 crore in unpaid dues.Liberty House was a late entrant in the auction of the company. By then, Tata Steel was already in the driving seat with a bid higher than that of JSW Steel.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-02-04,"The much-tracked auction of Bhushan Steel saw a flurry of activity as the bid deadline got over at 6pm on Saturday, February 3.JSW Steel, Tata Steel and a consortium of Bhushan Steel's employees, possibly backed by a Singapore-based fund, have put in bids for the troubled steel maker.The company, which had accumulated debt of over Rs 50,000 crore, had been put up for auction by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The bids were submitted on Saturday at the Gurgaon office of Deloitte, whose Vijaykumar V Iyer is the IRP (insolvency resolution professional) for Bhushan Steel.It is learnt that other companies such as ArcelorMittal, UK-based Liberty House and Steel Authority of India, who had earlier submitted expressions of interest, did not submit bids for the company. ""The company hasn't submitted a bid,"" said a source close to Liberty House, owned by NRI billionaire Sanjeev Gupta.The bids will now be opened on Tuesday.While the exact bid amounts couldn't be ascertained, it is believed to be around the Rs 28,000-30,000 crore mark. That is nearly twice the liquidation value of Rs 15,000 crore. The race, say executives, is a close one, and JSW Steel might just have its nose ahead in the race.The bid by Bhushan Steel’s staff is backed by 400 of the company's employees. ""This includes employees from across the organization, including the plants, and also from across hierarchy,"" a senior official from the company told Moneycontrol. The identity of the fund, which is backing the employees, couldn't be ascertained.Bhushan Steel, which has a steel facility and mining lease in Odisha, had accumulated debt of nearly Rs 50,000 crore.ControversyAlthough the bidding process generated a lot of interest, it wasn’t without its share of controversy. Some of the bidders alleged that ArcelorMittal placed its bid after the 6pm deadline on Saturday.""According to the rules, this is not possible,"" said a senior executive from a company that's in the race. One bidder even planned to lodge a protest with Deloitte on Monday.But by late evening on Sunday, ArcelorMittal said it had not bid for Bhushan Steel.""ArcelorMittal can confirm it has not bid for Bhushan steel, but we remain interested at looking at future opportunities in India,"" a company representative told Moneycontrol in an emailed statement.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-02-25,"Tata Steel is seeking UK government backing for a 60-million-pound project at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, according to a media report today.The project is aimed at overhauling a production line at Port Talbot to be able to make lighter steel for car-making, which is expected to secure the future of Britain's largest steel operation.The Indian steel giant is believed to have informally requested financial support from the government to upgrade its Continuous Annealing Process Line (CAPL) to make lighter, thinner and stronger galvanised steels, the Sunday Times reported.The move is aimed at meeting demands from the automotive sector, which is trying to slash the weight of cars to cut emissions.Industry sources told the newspaper that UK taxpayer support for the CAPL upgrade was integral to Tata committing to reline an ageing blast furnace.Without the extra investment, one of the two towering furnaces that convert iron ore into molten iron is due to finish operations by the end of next year.Tata Steel is understood to be working on a plan to extend the furnace's life until about 2026. However, this plan falls short of a full relining, which would cost about 150 million pounds.Maintaining Port Talbot's two furnaces is seen by workers' unions and the UK government as crucial to the survival of the plant, which has about 4,000 workers.In September 2017, UK business secretary Greg Clark wrote to Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, asking for a ""specific commitment"" to the relining.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-09-30,"After acquiring debt-laden Bhushan Steel through the insolvency and bankruptcy process, Tata Steel is now aiming to raise its production to 4 million tonne (MT) by the end of the current fiscal, an official said.Bhushan Steel's Odisha plant is presently operating at 3.5 MT against a capacity of 5 MT, the official said.""The Bhushan plant in Odisha has a capacity of 5 MT but is currently operating at 3.5 MT. We are working to raise the production at least to a level of 4 MT a year by March 2019 as demand remains robust,"" the official, who is part of the new team installed by Tata Steel in the company, told PTI.The Bhushan Steel plant is located close to Tata Steel's Kalinganagar facility where it has a 3 MT capacity.The official said the Kalinganagar plant expansion is on track despite Bhushan's takeover at Rs 36,000 crore.""Safety and environment aspects need to be strengthened in Bhushan Steel as they are not up to our (Tata Steel's) internal standards,"" he said.The new plant will follow Tata Steel's strategy of not just being a steel producer but a service company with extensive use of technology.Though Bhushan Steel will continue to be operated as a standalone outfit for the time being, a change of name is imminent to make it resemble a Tata company. The new management will be leveraging and complementing marketing strengths of Tata Steel, the official said.Tata Steel had earlier said there was a lot of synergies in taking over Bhushan Steel.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-12-24,"Tasked with a key job of helping recover unpaid corporate loans, the NCLT has helped resolve insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings involving more than Rs 80,000 crore in the year passing-by and the kitty is expected to swell beyond Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019 with several big-ticket default cases pending.Plans are afoot to further strengthen the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by increasing number of judges and benches and provide adequate infrastructure to fast-track the process, according to government officials.The new year will not only test the mettle of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), but also of the NCLT and its appellate body NCLAT, as several high-profile cases need to be resolved -- Essar Steel (involving over Rs 80,000 crore alone) and Bhushan Power & Steel (about Rs 45,000 crore due to its lenders) are just a few, experts said.In 2018, over Rs 80,000 crore was recovered from various corporate debtors, which had defaulted payments, under the IBC through various insolvency proceeding at the NCLT and the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal), Ministry of Corporate Affair Secretary Injeti Srinivas told PTI.As per estimates, the IBC has helped address stressed assets worth approximately Rs 3 lakh crore -- directly or indirectly -- since the new law came into force in December 2016.""The estimated amount includes recoveries made through resolution plan and cases settled before admission by the NCLT,"" he added.In 2019, the NCLT is expected to finalise corporate insolvency resolution process of several stressed assets through its 11 functional benches across India. These cases would include Essar Steel, Bhushan Power & Steel, Videocon Group, Monnet Ispat, Amtek Auto, Ruchi Soya, Lanco Infratech, Jaypee Infratech among others.Acording to law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Executive Partner Punit Dutt Tyagi, the new year is likely to ""test the mettle of the IBC as well as of the NCLT and NCLAT"".""Most of the major cases pending before the NCLT are likely to be resolved and these debtors are likely to come into hands of successful bidders,"" he added.In 2018, insolvency proceedings against some companies including Bhushan Steel, ElectroSteel Steel, Binani Cement were almost completed and the new management from their successful bidders -- Tata Steel, Vedanta group and Adity Birla-led UltraTech, respectively -- have taken over the management control of the stressed assets.Big Corporate houses including Arcelor Mittal, Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, UltraTech Cement, UK-based Liberty Group, Vedanta group, Dalmia Bharat group were among the leading companies which had submitted their resolution plans to acquire the debt ridden firms.Other major insolvency cases being handled by the NCLT and the NCLAT include RCom, Videocon group, Alok Industries, Lanco Infrateck, Jaypee Infratech, Jyoti Structures and ABG Shipyard.Although, the IBC mandates completion of insolvency proceedings within 180 days of appointment of a resolution professional by the NCLT, with provision for a further extension of 90 days totalling to 270 days, several matters are running behind the schedule.""Although the 270-day deadline could not be met in a majority of the cases, the NCLTs and the NCLAT have largely delivered well-reasoned decisions. It is commendable since these tribunals are not just applying the settled law, but also interpreting new legislation such as the IBC,"" Tyagi said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has appeared in some major IBC cases including of Essar Steel, said there is a shortage of staff and the government should appoint more judges.""The NCLAT is managing well despite the odds. Judicially, they need many more members, at least double more. They are also hugely under-staffed. It's more quantity (that is required), but quality of staff also needs serious up-gradation,"" Singhvi said.He also said the NCLAT premises are cramped and squeezed.The senior lawyer said a huge workload is difficult to handle with such severe infrastructure problems and these issues must be addressed immediately by the government.""There is no point in creating institutions and then crippling them,"" he added.According to Srinivas, there are around 10,000 cases pending before the NCLT and the NCLAT at different stages and most of the new cases coming at these quasi-judicial forums are from the insolvency side.""The government is focusing on these issues by increasing the number of members at NCLT and NCLAT. We would open more benches as per requirement and provide them more support in terns of trained staff, specially the young professionals and assistants, who would help the benches directly by doing research etc,"" Srinivas said.He further said, ""We are putting a lot of emphasis on capacity building because these are all complex laws and new challenges keep coming. Whatever best capacity development can be done by holding seminars, conferences, all that has been done... We have tried to de-clog the NCLT.""Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

2018-07-05,"Tata Steel has come out with a fair deal in the 50:50 JV between its European unit and Thyssenkrupp’s steel operations in the continent. Though the German company will eventually end up with a higher equity  — the JV will issue warrants worth 10 percent of equity capital to Thyssenkrupp — Tata’s equity value in the venture is now higher by $540 million (Rs 30/share).Not just that. The JV has envisaged that 4,000 jobs will be cut, but only 1,000 of that will fall in Tata’s UK business, whose below-par performance has been a matter of concern, and contention.But the Port Talbot facility in Wales remains the weak link in the JV, which also includes Tata Steel Europe’s operations in the Netherlands.“Much would depend on how UK’s exit from the European Union takes shape. If Brexit leads to duties on export and import of steel, this will have a huge impact on the UK steel industry,” said a senior executive from the industry who has worked in the Europe.“While it’s too early to say, the UK operations can’t afford to remain uncompetitive for long. The repercussions could be bad,” added another executive from a private steel company.The Brexit cut-off date is March 29, 2019.UK steel industryThe domestic steel industry hasn’t really recovered from the jolt it suffered from the 2008 financial crisis. And the rot had started setting in even before.In the last 20 years, crude steel production in the UK has declined by 39 percent and the domestic market has become a net importer from a net exporter.“It’s not that the local demand hasn’t recovered since the crisis. While demand has grown by 7 percent a year, the local industry hasn’t benefited from this. In fact, over the last decade and a half, demand for steel made in the UK has reduced by over 30 percent,” said the industry executive quoted first.That the UK industry exports over 40 percent of its production shows that it hasn’t evolved as per the needs of its local consumers, most prominently the auto ones, who now import.Port TalbotTata Steel's Europe facility in Port Talbot, Wales, is by far the largest steelmaker in the UK. But it continues to suffer from structural issues.“All the raw materials are imported and energy costs are high in the UK,” said the executive.Moreover, the facility doesn’t produce some of the products such as high strength grades used by the auto industry, or steel used in the construction, earth moving equipment and agricultural equipment.Earlier reports had surfaced saying that the UK operations of Tata Steel loses 1 million pounds a day.It also doesn’t help that Port Talbot is the smallest site in the JV with Tata Steel Europe’s Ijmuiden facility in Netherlands producing twice that of the Wales plant, which rolls out 3.5 million tons of steel a year. Thyssenkrupp’s Duisburg plant has a capacity of 12 million tonne a year. Interestingly, Ijmuiden and Duisburg are connected via waterways and are just 125 milles from each other.Structurally strongerA Credit Suisse report says the deal implies that Tata Steel Europe's EBITDA will improve to much higher levels than forecasted.Does it mean that Port Talbot will benefit under the new structure? Tata Steel Managing Director TV Narendran would surely think so.Commenting on the JV,  Narendran told a daily that the deal brings about a structural change.Till now, while its Indian operations were small but stronger structurally (given its low cost of production because of captive mines), the situation was opposite in the UK.“If I look at Tata Steel Europe, we are 10 million (tonne) and 3 million in the UK so that is less than 30 per cent of production. If you look at the joint venture, we have 22 million, 3 million of which is in the UK, so the joint venture is less vulnerable to what happens in the UK. Structurally, you become stronger as a joint venture than as Tata Steel Europe,” Narendran told The Hindu.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-02-13,"LN Mittal's dream to have a steel facility in his home country has been an unfulfilled one. For someone who has steel plants all over the world, including in South-East Asia, Europe and the US, this has been one inexplicable vacuum in his global footprint.The owner of the largest steelmaker in the world had tried. He wanted to build mega plants in Odisha, Jharkhand and Karnataka. But more than a decade of attempts later, none of the projects has taken off.There are smaller projects, including one with Steel Authority of India, that are on the works. But what Mittal would like is one of those mammoth steel plants churning out the hot metal, especially when the Indian market is set to double to more than 200 million tons within a decade.The pursuit of that dream has now landed him at the gates of Essar Steel. Mittal’s ArcelorMittal on Monday put in a bid for Essar Steel, which had been referred to the National Company Law Tribunal for accumulating debts of over Rs 40,000 crore.Though interested in other companies, such as Bhushan Steel, who were also brought under the hammer, ArcelorMittal had refrained from bidding till now. Mittal was waiting for the biggest prize of them all.“Essar provides a compelling opportunity for ArcelorMittal to enter the high growth Indian steel market,"" Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal said in a statement on Monday.It’s compelling, but not easy.Mittal will have to counter the challenge from Shashi and Ravi Ruia. The brothers will be keen to hold on to the steel business, which is an integral pillar of their empire that lost some sheen in 2016. They had to sell Essar Oil to Rosneft in 2016 for USD 13 billion to pare debts. Essar Steel is another jewel, and the brothers are not ready to part with it.An amendment in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) – it barred promoters from bidding for their stressed companies unless they cleared dues – prevents the brothers from making a direct bid. But the family has created a complex structure in the form of Numetal Mauritius, which has Russia’s VTB Bank and Rewant Ruia, son of Ravi Ruia, as shareholders. Numetal submitted its bid for Essar Steel yesterday.""Numetal has submitted a bid for Essar Steel India Ltd. The company is led by VTB and other minority shareholders. Any details of the bid cannot be disclosed at the moment,"" the company said in a mailed statement to Moneycontrol on Monday.“Connected person”Sources tell Moneycontrol that the bids will be opened on Wednesday. “The resolution plans presented by the two companies will be studied tomorrow. Thereon, the bids will be forwarded to the Committee of Creditors. An announcement may be possible as early as next week,”  a senior executive from the industry said today.But others contend that the process may be slower and complicated.ArcelorMittal may have sold its stake in the Uttam Galva Steels, which had been also referred to the NCLT for unpaid dues;  but questions remain on Mittal’s investment in another company KSS, whose unit KSS Petron as defaulted.ArcelorMittal has clarified that its bid for stressed assets in India won’t be compromised by its investment in KSS Petron. But on Wednesday, as its bid for Essar Steel is opened and examined by the resolution professional, the company will still have to answer questions.The Ruias also face a similar predicament. Though Rewant Ruia is a minority shareholder in Numetal, will he be considered as a promoter? If yes, does that mean that Ruia is a “connected person,” as defined under the IBC? The answer to that will seal the fate of the family and its legacy with Essar Steel.The industry is abuzz with the possibility of banks turning down both the bids. “Not only will it bring down the bidding value, but will also give an opportunity to other players to join the race,”  said an industry executive.Tata Steel and Vedanta, among the companies who had initially shown interest in Essar Steel, surprised everyone by not submitting a bid on Monday. Will they make use if that window opens?The liquidation value of Essar Steel has been put at Rs 20,000 crore.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-04-23,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today asked the lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by UK-based Liberty House for the debt-ridden company.Allowing the plea of Liberty House, the tribunal has directed the committee of creditors (CoC) to complete its resolution proceedings by June 23.A two-member NCLT bench, headed by President Justice M M Kumar, said that Liberty House bid cannot be disqualified only on the ground of being submitted after the deadline of the resolution professional (RP).""We hope that CoC takes an appropriate commercial decision as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),"" said NCLT.The tribunal's order came over a petition filed by Liberty House, challenging the rejection of its bid by the RP for Bhushan Power and Steel on account of late submission.Welcoming the order, a Liberty House Spokesperson said, ""The judgement came out today. The NCLT has given the judgement in our favour saying that our bid should be considered for such a good asset. We are really grateful to the court...""The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House's bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm.Liberty House had moved the NCLT on February 26 against the rejection.Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel without even opening the seal of its offer.An official with JSW Steel refused to comment on the development but said the company at present is focusing on Essar Steel.Tata Steel Spokesperson also declined to comment.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-03-12,"Malay Mukherjee had a nearly two-decade stint at ArcelorMittal, where he was often called Lakshmi Mittal's right-hand man. Later,  the steel industry veteran served as the CEO of Essar Steel for two years.Now a global consultant, Mukherjee says that the Indian steel industry has suffered because many promoters think only about themselves. That is why, adds Mukherjee in an interview with Moneycontrol, the sale of stressed assets is a great opportunity to strike a balance and ensure that the Indian steel industry fulfills its promise.With an insider's knowledge of Essar Steel, Mukherjee has no doubt who is the best fit to buy the stressed steel company, and that is ArcelorMittal. Excerpts...The Indian steel industry at present is engrossed in the sale of stressed assets, some of which have got global attention. How do you see this phase?I certainly believe that it is a good thing for the Indian steel industry. We are far from exploiting the total potential of the industry, especially if we have to cater to the increasing demand. Even now our per capita consumption of steel is about 80 kg, way below the world average, or China's.To reach these targets we must have a balanced steel manufacturing industry.Unfortunately, what has happened is that some promoters have not applied financials controls, were over-leveraged and created a pretty unfavourable judgement of the Indian steel industry, vis-à-vis the global market. Many of the promoters think only about themselves.This step is in the right direction, to increase transparency and finding the right investor who has professional and technical expertise in running the companies, in keeping view interests of all the stakeholders.You mentioned that we need to have a balanced steel manufacturing industry. What does that mean?For balance in the steel industry, we need a level playing field – in access to infrastructure, raw materials. And this should be done in a manner where we don’t promote one company, and create inefficiency in another. For instance, there can't be a structure where someone who didn’t have capital to buy a mine, is now barred from buying iron ore forever.Talking about promoters, many of them blame the steel cycle for the distress.But the steel business is such that you have to contend with the business cycle. You can’t really blame the cycle when others have been able to manage.I went to a few of the stressed assets being auctioned. If the total capital is USD 100, promoters have spent USD 95 in assets and just USD 5 in building the infrastructure to support the assets. That is a wrong way to allocate capital.In one of the plants, the promoter wanted to bring the raw material by road. Now instead of spending money on building roads, he could have built a rail network.In another plant, there was no proper infrastructure to handle raw materials, which is 65 percent of the total costs.Basically, many of these promoters thought steel is a money making machine. They had no expertise.Some of the stressed assets have seen intense competition. Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel is deemed high. What is your observation?Tata Steel’s bid for Bhushan Steel may look like a over-bid at the first glance. But then the Tatas have certain basic advantage over other companies. They have access to captive mines, and in Odisha – where they already have a facility – they can create a major hub. (Bhushan Steel also has facilities in Odisha).So the capital spend will be compensated by lower operating costs. Tata Steel has the bandwidth to tune the operations and make marketing more structured.If it was any other company that has bid so high, then the analysis would have been different.Do you think JSW Steel could have been more aggressive (Mukherjee is an independent director at the company)?In JSW Steel’s case, they have always been building assets. They are very good in building world class assets at lower costs. So they are not going to pay extra to buy an asset. It is a choice.Coming to Essar Steel's auction, ArcelorMittal, which is one of the bidders, has highlighted its global experience in turning around operations. Given your experience at the company, could you give an insight into this?From a historical point of view, ArcelorMittal took over plant facilities that were owned by Governments, and turned them around. This was the model in Trinidad, Mexico, Kazakhstan, and even in developed markets like Germany.The turnaround was operational – increase capacity and bring down costs.Later on, ArcelorMittal’s strategy was to make the best product in steel, in addition to turning around operations. This was the case in the US.Overall, ArcelorMittal’s turnaround strategy has been about operations, financial discipline and products. It also helps that they have the world’s largest R&D facility for a steel company.If you have all this, then it’s a no-brainer that the best partner for Essar  Steel is ArcelorMittal.You were Essar Steel CEO. How do you assess the asset?Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

2018-08-21,"The size of the alleged Bhushan Steel fraud, which is currently tipped to be around Rs 2,000 crore, may jump to about Rs 6,000-7,000 crore, sources have told Moneycontrol.Bhushan Steel, and its erstwhile promoters, have been previously accused of “siphoning off over Rs 2,000 crore” from loans availed by it “by using more than 80 companies”, according the Finance Ministry.But a source close to the investigation said the SFIO has discovered a lot more illegal transactions than was previously thought. It has discovered instances where money taken from banks was used to put down as promoter equity for further loans, fund purchases such as property and expensive cars, or outright take them out through more than hundred shell companies. The SFIO is also probing certain cash payments the company had made, the source said.The SFIO has arrested Neeraj Singhal, the erstwhile Promoter and Vice-Chairman of Bhushan Steel. This was the first arrest by the SFIO since it was given the power last year in fraud investigations. The SFIO was in August 2017, granted the powers to arrest people for violations of companies law, with the government notifying relevant provisions amid the crackdown on illicit fund flows.Bhushan Steel is one of the 12 big cases that had been referred for insolvency resolution by banks. The company was referred to the NCLT last year after accumulating over Rs 50,000 crore debt.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-08-27,"Moneycontrol NewsLenders will submit bids for Bhushan Power & Steel to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on September 6. The tribunal had earlier deferred a decision on the bids after the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Earlier this month, JSW Steel had emerged as the highest bidder, beating bids from Tata Steel and Liberty House. “The CoC (Committee of Creditors, consisting of the lenders) will submit the bids to the NCLAT, which is then expected to take a call,” said an executive from the industry.JSW Steel had revised its bid, first from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 19,000 crore and then further to Rs 19,700 crore.Reports added that Liberty House increased its bid by Rs 500 crore to Rs 19,500 crore.

2018-06-05,"Tata Motors, India’s largest automotive maker by revenues, is open to selling stake in Tata Motors Finance, a vehicle financier fully owned by the Mumbai-based company.The stake sale will be part of the value unlocking process kickstarted by the maker of cars and trucks even as it looks to sustain the positive momentum in sales and profitability.As part of the process, the company has identified nearly 10 options, including shutting down of loss-making companies, winding up of unviable projects, off-loading of equity in some companies and merging of allied services.PB Balaji, group chief financial officer, Tata Motors, said: “We have taken a hard look at the subsidiaries of Tata Motors in India and looked at what was the strategic roadmap, what was the role, why do we think we will win competitively in the future. On that basis we have taken some very clear calls.”Tata Technologies, Tata Hitachi, Tata Precision, Trilix and Tata Motors European Technical Center (TMETC) are the entities which will be a part of this exercise. As for Tata Motors Finance (TMF), the profit-making company may see stake dilution by the promoter company, said Balaji.“We are very clear that we will now continue to invest as far as Tata Motors Finance is concerned. We will maintain control as far as Tata Motors Finance is concerned, but clearly there is no intention to say that we should always hold it at 100 percent, that is also clear. As far as others are concerned, the strategic review is underway, and these will be updated in due course”, added Balaji.Financial turnaroundProfit before tax of TMF stood at Rs 291 crore last financial year as against a loss of Rs 699 crore posted in 2016-17, as per financial details disclosed by Tata Motors. TMF not only managed to dramatically reduce its gross non-performing asset (GNPA) to four percent from 17.9 percent during the two years its market share stood improved to 25 percent from 22 percent.TMF’s total asset under management stood at Rs 27,932 crore last year, a 24 percent growth compared to Rs 22,517 crore. Last year saw a disbursal growth of 66 percent, the highest in its history, to Rs 15,400 crore.Last month, Tata Motors said it had written off working capital of Rs 1,641 crore in some of the vehicle projects that it does not intend to carry forward. Nearly 60 percent of that belongs to Tata Motors, and the balance to Jaguar Land Rover. Racemo, a production-ready mini performance car, which was put on the backburner, has now been put up for sale.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-01-19,"In an industry, where most players are operating at about 50-55 percent capacity utilisations, companies like Tata Sponge stand out with almost 110 percent capacity utilisation. While addressing analysts conference call, management highlighted the industry is going through difficulties as a result of low availability of the iron ore and higher coal prices leading to overall very low level of production. This comes at a time when sponge iron, used in making steel, is in higher demand as a result of robust prospects of the steel industry.Tata Sponge has been able to capitalise on this trend  thanks to the support from Tata Steel, parent company, for the supply of iron ore and its proximity to iron ore belt and ports.Strong quarterHigher demand and better pricing environment is helping the company to report good sales growth. During the quarter ended December 2017, company reported realisations of close to Rs 17,300 per tonne leading to strong 50.3 percent increase in sales to Rs 215 crore.The benefits of operating leverage and the fact that the company was able to pass on the hike in raw material prices led to strong growth in earnings. During the quarter ended December 2017, the company reported strong 22 percent operating margins as against 8 percent in the year-ago quarter.In fact, there was a three-fold increase in profit to Rs 36 crore as against 11 crore last year despite hike in raw material prices. During the quarter the company’s coal cost increased to Rs 8,198 per tonne as against Rs 6,757 per tonne in the year ago period. Similarly, iron ore prices also moved up marginally from Rs 2,196 per tonne to Rs 2,257 per tonne.Sting on huge cashCurrently sponge iron prices are trading at about Rs 20,000 per tonne and management believes it will remain firm given the demand-supply situation. This is also a reason for earnings growth to remain strong over the next two quarters with good cash flow generation.Beyond that, considering the company is operating at full capacity, there is not much leeway to improve profits other than improvement in realisations, till the time new capacities are added.As of now, the company is still evaluating its 1.5 million tonne steel capacity addition plans, as a part of forward integration. The management said it will take about 2.5 years from the time the company gets environment clearances. Meanwhile, the company is also contemplating participation in government’s upcoming auction of iron ore mines, which could be positive and help in utilising the cash in the books.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-10-03,"Modular furniture is not something one would relate to Tata Steel, the largest steel maker in the country. But after successfully launching doors and windows that are made of steel but look like wood, the company  has now launched modular furniture.Chief, Services & Solutions, Tata Steel, told Moneycontrol. ""We are expanding the channel to cover the entire northern region by March 2019,"" he added.The new venture follows the success of Pravesh, the brand under which doors and windows are sold. The company's first initiative in the B2C segment, Tata Steel has sold 60,000 doors and windows since launching them in December 2016. The vertical clocked revenues of Rs 75 crore in FY18.The ideaThe need for sturdy doors and windows came up during the the company's discussions with consumers.""We have a business vertical that is focused on trying to understand the expressed and latent needs of customers and coming up with solutions to address the same,"" said Anand.In one of the discussions, consumers pointed out the problem with wooden doors, which were deemed to be unsafe and breakable.""Theft was a major issue in Tier II and Tier III cities. Besides, there were issues associated with wood, like expansion/contraction and termites. The quality of wood used to make doors left a lot to be desired,"" said Anand.Sensing an opportunity, Tata Steel introduced the Pravesh brand that sold doors ""with strength of steel and the finish and elegance of wood.""Building capabilityFor a steelmaker, it is not easy to sell a retail product. To make up for that, Tata Steel borrowed practices from the consumer durables industry.It formed a team of 200 sales executives, and another team consisting of 150 people specialised in installation was also set up. The company tapped its dealer network.""Pravesh being a consumer facing product, a dedicated call centre team has been deployed to answer any query/manage complaints of the consumer,"" said Anand.Pravesh is sold through a 2-Tier retail network. ""We have 45 distributors/business development partners and 2,100 dealer outlets across the country,"" said the senior Tata Steel executive.Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

2018-11-16,"In a firm pricing environment, companies like Tata Steel, that have been building capacities through the organic and inorganic route have been big beneficiaries. This is precisely the reason that Tata Steel reported a very good set of numbers backed by strong performance delivered across businesses.On a consolidated basis, during Q2FY19, the company reported a strong 34 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in sales to Rs 43,544 crore. This was largely on account of higher contribution from the subsidiaries. The domestic standalone business saw a marginal 2 percent growth in volumes to 3.2 million tonnes. However, on account of the better pricing environment, it benefitted because of the higher realisations.During the quarter, India business realisations grew by 22.4 percent to Rs 55,282 per tonne. Moreover, the recently-acquired Bhushan Steel more than doubled its sales turnover to Rs 5862 crore during Q2FY19 as against Rs 2108 crore in Q1FY19. Bhushan Steel is ramping up its business with the focus on rationalising operations and inventories. Similarly, the South East Asian operations reported a strong 22 percent growth in sales.Operating performanceThanks to the operating efficiencies kicking in because of the high scale, the company gained in terms of operating margins. During the quarter, operating margins expanded by 600 basis points to 20.5 percent largely on account of lower cost and higher realisations.To put in perspective, because of its captive resources during Q2FY19, the standalone business made an EBITDA per tonne of Rs 19,244 per tonne as against Rs 11,078 per tonne in the corresponding quarter last year. Besides, Bhushan delivered an EBITDA of close to Rs 1,175 crore as against an EBITDA of Rs 66 crore in Q1FY19.While European business grew very marginally in terms of revenues, its contribution was higher at the operating levels led by higher contribution from the value-added products and cost savings. During the quarter, Europe made an EBITDA of Rs 4,886 a tonne as against Rs 2,816 a tonne in Q2FY18. The overall better operating performance also lifted profitability. During the quarter, the company reported an almost three-fold jump in net profit to Rs 3116 crore.Valuation and outlookThe management expects prices to remain stable and more benefits coming because of the integration of Bhushan Steel. That apart, as the capex reaches its maturity, the company is now looking to use internal cash for deleveraging the balance sheet. However, it would be worth monitoring progress on the acquisition of Usha Martin and Bhushan Power. In terms of valuations, at 6.5 times FY20 estimated earnings stock is reasonably valued.Follow @jitendra1929Podcast | Decoding 2019: Congress says 'Hum Nibhaayenge', but what does it promise?Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.
