2018-03-28,"DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Plans by Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel to combine their European steel operations face renewed opposition from German unions, who say the companies’ labour agreement in the Netherlands goes too far in protecting work and sites there. Last month Tata Steel guaranteed its Dutch division it could continue to operate as an independent company within the planned joint venture with ThyssenKrupp, with control over its own profits and an independent supervisory board. The plant in IJmuiden would remain a “fully integrated steel company”, Tata Steel Netherlands said. Tata Steel also operates a plant in Port Talbot, Britain. “It is not acceptable that only we in Germany are to be responsible for the risks of the joint venture and the Dutch entity is dodging responsibility,” Thyssenkrupp supervisory board member Tekin Nasikkol told Reuters, adding German employees would not accept this. “We will not accept a free state of IJmuiden.” The planned tie-up will be discussed at an extraordinary meeting of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board on April 12, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last year announced plans to combine their European steel operations to create the continent’s second-largest player after ArcelorMittal, including up to 4,000 job cuts. Thyssenkrupp and Tata have said the deal will help them tackle overcapacity in Europe’s steel market, which faces cheap imports, subdued construction demand and inefficient old plants. The signing of the deal was originally planned for the beginning of the year but a key condition is still lacking: a final labour agreement between Tata Steel and its workers in Britain and the Netherlands. Last month, steel workers at Germany’s Thyssenkrupp voted in favour of a labour agreement that will safeguard jobs and plants in a planned joint venture with Tata Steel until 2026, removing a key hurdle for the tie-up. Dutch union members still have to approve a similar preliminary agreement with Tata Steel, and are waiting for a positive opinion from Tata’s Dutch workers representative committee before they give their final consent. “That will probably still take several months,” Peter Boeseken, a spokesman of Dutch union CNV, said, adding Tata and ThyssenKrupp could proceed with the joint venture without consent “as long as no irreversible measure are taken”. Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. Although not essential to the creation of the planned joint venture, workers’ approval of the labour agreement is seen as a precondition to getting the deal done as it removes the risk of strikes and potential delays.

2018-10-31,"(Reuters) - Tata Steel Ltd said on Wednesday it will continue talks with the European Commission after the body raised concerns over its planned steel joint venture with Thyssenkrupp. The European Commission (EC) on Tuesday opened a deeper investigation into the proposed steel joint venture over concerns that it could raise prices and harm competition. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel earlier this year unveiled plans to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain to become the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal. The Commission on Tuesday pointed out three areas where the combination of both companies’ specialty flat carbon steel and electrical steel products could give them a dominant position: steel for the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and grain-oriented electrical steel. Tata Steel shares, which had fallen as much as 6.2 percent in the current session, were trading down 3.2 percent at 0825 GMT.

2018-06-11,"LONDON/FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Tata Steel’s European works council said it is unconvinced by a planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, raising the chances that the deal will be delayed or even fail in its current form. The remarks deal a fresh blow to Thyssenkrupp boss Heinrich Hiesinger, at the helm of the German steel-to-submarine group for more than seven years, whose plan to sharpen the company’s focus on technology largely depends on the steel transaction. They are also in line with growing criticism from investors, including U.S. activist fund Elliott, who have pointed out the diverging fortunes of the two groups since the venture was first announced last year and have asked Thyssenkrupp to seek better terms. Tata Steel’s European Works Council (EWC) said on Monday that numerous details of the deal still needed to be hammered out before they could endorse a deal. The comments make it less likely that a planned end of June deadline could be met. “The EWC acknowledges there is an industrial rationale for pursuing this JV, but with the matters outstanding the EWC remains unconvinced that this partnership with Thyssenkrupp would be in the best interests of Tata Steel Europe’s operations and the employees we represent,” it said in a statement. The planned transaction would combine Thyssenkrupp’s and Tata Steel’s European steel operations to create the continent’s second-largest steelmaker, behind ArcelorMittal, with sales of 15 billion euros ($18 billion). The EWC, however, said that it still had significant knowledge gaps with regard to the financial structure and the business strategy of the planned 50-50 joint venture, adding Thyssenkrupp was unwilling to lay out plans for the partnership. “This situation is deeply regrettable,” the EWC said in its statement. It said its support for the joint venture depended on factors like a moratorium on job cuts until 2022 and no Tata Steel site closures before 2026. It also wants the sale of Tata’s electrical steel subsidiary Cogent to be put on hold. Since the deal was announced in September, core earnings (EBITDA) at Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe rose by about a third on a 12-month basis, while those at Tata Steel Europe declined by about a fifth, according to Reuters calculations. Some shareholders say this has created a valuation gap of up to 3 billion euros, which Thyssenkrupp’s management needs to address in the final negotiations, possibly by transferring more debt to the venture than initially planned. This will likely form one of the topics to be discussed when Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board meets on Wednesday, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Thyssenkrupp was not immediately available for comment. A Tata Steel spokesman said: “We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our employee representatives throughout the process of creating the proposed joint venture.” He said Tata Steel was committed to delivering the joint venture without the need for compulsory redundancies.

2018-12-17,"FRANKFURT/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and India’s Tata Steel on Monday named the top management of their planned European joint venture, ending months of uncertainty over who will join the entity’s leadership. Andreas Goss, the head of Thyssenkrupp’s steel division, will become the chief executive of the entity, which will be Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal. Hans Fischer, who is currently leading Tata Steel’s European division, will become deputy CEO and chief technology officer. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in June signed a final agreement to create the venture following years of talks, just days before a leadership crisis erupted at the sprawling German industrials group. Sandip Biswas, a member of Tata Steel’s senior management, will become finance chief of the new entity, the groups said. Premal Desai, who serves as the chief financial officer of Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit, will complete the board as chief strategy officer. “The future management board is the right choice to build a strong number two in the European flat steel market,” Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said. “I am fully convinced that this Board will successfully lead the integration of the Joint Venture given their extensive technical and operational expertise as well as their broad intercultural experiences.” The appointment of Goss as CEO of the joint venture, which still requires antitrust approval by the EU Commission, was first flagged by Reuters earlier this month, as was the fact that the board would comprise four members. Both groups had originally aimed to have six management board members for the 50-50 venture. The next level management will be named in early 2019, the companies said.

2018-07-02,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Tata Steel Ltd will be able to nearly double its capacity in India as a deal between its British entity and Germany’s ThyssenKrupp will reduce the Indian parent’s debt, the chairman of the company said on Monday. Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp signed a deal on Saturday after months of negotiations to form Europe’s second biggest steel company in which Tata and ThyssenKrupp will have a 50:50 partnership. “Because Europe becomes stronger, it reduces our leverage,” Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran told a news conference in Brussels that was shown in India via a webcast. “(The deal) allows Indian operations to grow and address the Indian market,” he said. Chandrasekaran and ThyssenKrupp Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger jointly addressed the conference. The deal will allow Tata Steel to transfer up to 2.6 billion euros ($3 billion) of debt on its European business to the joint venture company, relieving the Indian parent from substantial interest payments, he said. Chandrasekaran, who is also the chairman of the salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, said Tata Steel aims to increase its capacity in India from 13 million tonnes per annum currently to 25 million tonnes. While he did not give a timeline at the conference in Brussels, he had said in September that Tata Steel would like to double its capacity in India in five years. In the last few months, the third-biggest steelmaker in India has been one of the most aggressive companies in picking up distressed assets after a new bankruptcy code pushed several steel companies into debt resolution in India. The company picked up debt-ridden Bhushan Steel Ltd for 352.33 billion rupees ($5.12 billion) in May and has been short-listed as the highest bidder for unlisted Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. Together, the two acquisitions would help the company to increase its market share in India while also lead to a higher debt, analysts have said. Restructuring in Europe allows the company to focus on opportunities in India, said T V Narendran, chief executive of Tata Steel, said in Brussels. “It will not be a company that will be sucking cash but will be generating cash,” Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel told analysts on Saturday.

2018-03-07,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Tata Steel Ltd said on Wednesday it had been selected as the highest bidder to buy a controlling stake in debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd, ending weeks of speculation on which Indian group would clinch a deal. Salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group’s steel business and India’s biggest domestic steelmaker JSW Steel Ltd were the two primary industry bidders for the acquisition of Bhushan Steel.  At 559.89 billion rupees ($8.75 billion), Bhushan Steel faces the highest claims among a dozen companies pushed to bankruptcy court last year as part of a government drive to clear a mountain of bad loans choking credit at Indian banks. “It (Tata Steel) has been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire controlling stake of BSL (Bhushan Steel Ltd),” the company said in a stock exchange notice on Wednesday evening. Based in the east of India, the company has an annual steelmaking capacity of 5.6 million tonnes and is one of the biggest producers of cold-rolled steel products used to make cars. It also supplies steel for producing consumer goods such as refrigerators and washing machines.  A controlling stake in Bhushan Steel gives Tata Steel an edge in the fast growing automotive steel market in India at a time of strong steel price upswing, a note from brokerage Edelweiss Securities said. Tata’s access to iron ore mines also puts it in a much better position to turn around Bhushan Steel’s unit. “Tata Steel can add the maximum value as well as draw the most benefit from Bhushan Steel,” said an analyst who covers both the industry. Bhushan Steel had said last month that the resolution professional managing its case received plans from Tata Steel, JSW Living, a subsidiary of JSW Steel, and employees of Bhushan Steel. India, which did not have a formal bankruptcy process until mid-2016, has seen a surge in bankruptcy cases since last year, with over 500 companies currently facing bankruptcy court proceedings. The surge in cases comes after the government changed the law giving greater powers to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has so far ordered creditor banks to push nearly 40 companies with loan defaults of nearly 4 trillion rupees ($62.5 billion) into bankruptcy proceedings. Essar Steel Ltd, another company with a heap of sour loans owed to banks, has seen heightened interest and aggressive bidding from world’s biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and a consortium led by Russian bank VTB, according to media reports.

2018-05-18,"(Reuters) - India’s Tata Steel Ltd said on Friday it had completed  the acquisition of a 72.7 percent stake in Bhushan Steel Ltd, which was in bankruptcy court over unpaid loans. As part of the deal, a unit of Tata Steel is paying 352.33 billion rupees ($5.18 billion) to Bhushan Steel’s creditor banks. It will also pay Bhushan Steel’s operational creditors, such as vendors, another 12 billion rupees over 12 months. The Tata Steel unit will raise a bridge loan of 165 billion rupees to help fund the acquisition, while Tata Steel is investing the remainder in the unit, Bamnipal Steel. Bamnipal has appointed members to Bhushan Steel’s board, Tata Steel said in a statement. Bhushan Steel, which was among a dozen companies pushed to bankruptcy court last year amid a government drive to clear a mountain of bad loans choking credit at Indian banks, has an annual steel making capacity of about 5.6 million tonnes.

2018-03-22,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Tata Steel has offered to pay a little more than 350 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) to lenders of Bhushan Steel & Power to take over the bankrupt steelmaker, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said. Bhushan Steel’s panel of creditors approved the deal on Thursday, pending other regulatory clearances, the company said in a stock exchange filing on Friday without disclosing financial details. Tata Steel plans to inject more than 90 billion rupees into Bhushan Steel to modernise and ramp up its facilities, the source said, declining to be named because the details had not been made public. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the deal value and planned investment in Bhushan Steel. Bhushan Steel is among a dozen companies pushed to bankruptcy court last year amid a government drive to clear a mountain of bad loans choking credit at Indian banks. The company, which was facing $8.6 billion of claims from banks and other creditors, had received bids from Tata Steel and top Indian steelmaker JSW Steel in an auction conducted by a court-appointed administrator.  Taking over Bhushan Steel will help Tata Steel to increase capacity in India and gives the company an edge in the fast-growing automotive steel market.

2018-11-14,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s two biggest private sector steel companies JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on steel giant ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter the country.     In October, creditors of bankrupt Essar Steel India approved a 500 billion rupee ($6.9 billion) joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for Essar’s assets, paving the way for the first major foreign bets on steel manufacturing in India. Both JSW Steel and Tata Steel, during separate meetings with media on Tuesday, said the entry of the global giant in India’s fast growing steel market would be good for competition. However, the companies said their customer relationships, array of value-added products and customisation would help them retain and grow market share and take on competition.  “Obviously from Tata Steel point of view, we will continue to up the ante,” T.V. Narendran, chief executive and managing director of Tata Steel said on Tuesday. “We have the technology and the product lines that are required.” ArcelorMittal’s entry into India comes at a time when Indian steel demand is growing at the fastest pace in the world. India is expected to overtake the United States in steel consumption in 2019 to become the second biggest market behind China, global steel body World Steel Association said in a report last month.  ArcelorMittal plans to increase capacity of Essar’s plant to 15 million tonnes from 10 million tonnes now, and produce higher grades of products. Owned by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal is the world’s biggest steel company with a total tonnage of 97.03 million tonnes in 2017. Analysts feel ArcelorMittal’s foray will force major Indian steelmakers to innovate, despite them downplaying the impact. “ArcelorMittal’s entry would spur a shift from steel capacity expansion to product/technology evolution by incumbents,” said domestic broking firm Edelweiss in a report. Indian steelmakers say this is already in the works.     “Each one of us in my view has enough space,” Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, said on Tuesday, referring to India’s growing steel market. Rao said in-line with global trends JSW had already started to move from “volumes to value” to secure its profitability and market share in the future. JSW Steel is spending up to 60 billion rupees to expand its value-added offerings like automotive steel, electrical steel, and galvanised products by over 60 percent over the next three years, out of a total spend of 450 billion rupees on expansions. “We will completely transform JSW Steel ... and also align the company in-line with what the market demands,” he said.

2018-04-06,"LONDON/MUMBAI/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - India’s Tata Steel would consider taking a majority stake in its planned European steel joint venture with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp after the business has publicly listed, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Tata’s willingness to increase its holding is a sign of its commitment to expanding its steel empire globally, said the sources. This had been questioned by investors and analysts in recent years after the company, under former group boss Cyrus Mistry, put its British steel assets up for sale following years of losses. Such a development in the planned joint venture - which would create Europe’s second-largest steel group after ArcelorMittal - would also fit with Thyssenkrupp’s strategy of reducing exposure to steelmaking to concentrate on manufacturing high-margin industrial and technology goods. “They have different visions. Thyssenkrupp is looking to exit the steel sector while Tata is looking to stay and grow,” said one of the sources. Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. The two companies struck a preliminary deal last year to merge their European steel assets into the 50:50 joint venture. Investors widely expect a flotation of the business, something that both companies have said could happen. Tata Steel would “down the road be open to taking over a larger piece of the pie” in the Thyssenkrupp tie-up once the merged entity is publicly listed, the second source said.  The source added that this would depend on market conditions at the time of a listing and how well the company’s operations were in doing in India. Thyssenkrupp and Tata must retain a joint stake of at least 50.1 percent in the venture for at least six years following the deal’s closing in the event of an IPO, according to a labor agreement between Thyssenkrupp and its workers seen by Reuters. The deal does not specify how that stake should be split up, however, meaning Thyssenkrupp could in theory reduce its stake to, for example, 1 percent if Tata Steel agreed to take on the other 49.1 percent. “We haven’t addressed at all the question of an end, of a minimum (stake),” Thyssenkrupp Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff told journalists in February when asked about whether both groups would equally divide the 50.1 percent stake. Global steel equity values have more than doubled since hitting 12-year lows in early 2016 at the depth of the steel sector crisis.  Tata’s push to expand reflects a broader global trend towards consolidation of a fragmented steelmaking industry. The biggest players, including industry leader ArcelorMittal, China’s Hebei Iron and Steel Group (Hesteel) and India’s JSW Steel are looking to snap up assets across the world as the market rebounds.  Thyssenkrupp, an industrial firm as opposed to a pure steel player like the others, has long been open about its desire to sell out of steel. Both the Tata tie-up and last year’s sale of its Brazilian steel mill CSA were done with a view to drastically lower Thyssenkrupp’s exposure to steel and transform the group into a technology and industrials powerhouse. Many investors have welcomed this strategy to slim down the sprawling industrial group to remove some of the conglomerate discount that they say weighs on the stock. For Tata Steel, by contrast, the joint venture is a move to save its ailing European steel business, which has been burning through about $1 billion of cash a year, by getting better economies of scale. Another major contrast between the two companies centers on ownership structure and corporate philosophy. Tata Steel’s holding company is Tata Sons, a $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate which is 65 percent owned by Tata Trusts - public charities that have a major say in group decisions and have historically favored the good of all stakeholders over shareholder returns. In 2016, former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was ousted by family patriarch and Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata, in a dispute that involved competing corporate ethics and vision. The octogenarian Tata was acquisitive, legacy driven and an exponent of the traditional Tata Trusts view that companies exist to provide value and service to a community, making profits as a by-product of that process. Mistry, by contrast, was more focused on increasing shareholder returns, being nimble and cutting debt. He put Tata Steel’s British assets up for sale in 2016 and even considered closing down the business. Ratan Tata took issue with the move, even though the UK operation was losing 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) a day at the time. Thyssenkrupp, too, is 21-percent owned by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, a philanthropic institution, but their stake is below the 25 percent threshold required to block important strategic decisions.

2018-07-04,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF/LONDON (Reuters) - Top managers at Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel have reached out to the European Commission to seek approval for a landmark joint venture deal, with legal experts and analysts saying they might have to sell assets to get it. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel on Saturday agreed to merge their European steel activities into a 50-50 joint venture, creating the continent’s No.2 steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in combined sales. Informal talks with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager began a few weeks ago and will likely address the issue of disposals in some niche areas, including packaging, the sources say. Tata Steel Europe already has an asset sale programme underway. “Even without knowing all the details of the transaction, much speaks in favour of discussing asset sales,” said Jens Steger, counsel at law firm Simmons & Simmons, who advised Monsanto on antitrust matters in the takeover by Bayer. Steger said he had received several requests from third parties who are interested in becoming part of the process, adding these could, in theory, be competitors keen on assets that might come up for sale or shareholders who oppose the deal. Earlier this year, larger rival ArcelorMittal was able to secure EU approval for its purchase of Italian group Ilva only after pledging to sell a string of businesses across Europe to address competition concerns. Experts see few problems regarding crude steel production of the combined Thyssenkrupp-Tata Steel venture, which Moody’s reckons will own just 14 percent of the European market, a distant second to ArcelorMittal’s 29 percent, which includes Ilva. “But there could be remedies with regard to niche products,” said a senior steel banker. “There you would have to sell individual parts. And that would not be a problem.” Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel would have about a 50 percent share of the European packaging steel, or tinplate, market, which could require them to dispose of some of those assets, a person familiar with the industry told Reuters. “Our understanding is that while upstream consolidation does not raise red flags, downstream specialty products such as tinplate may require remedy measures,” Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld said in a note. Rasselstein, Thyssenkrupp’s packaging steel unit, made sales of 1.16 billion euros in the fiscal year 2015/2016 and employs about 2,400 employees. It is also unclear how an ongoing asset disposal programme at Tata Steel Europe, initiated before the signing of the joint venture deal, will play into antitrust negotiations. It has put a number of assets on the block, including Cogent, a manufacturer and processor of electrical steels, and about 1,100 employees, or about 5 percent of Tata Steel Europe’s workforce, would leave the group should all deals be realised. “I would be surprised if antitrust considerations did not play a role here,” Simmons & Simmons’ Steger said. The European Commission and Tata Steel declined to comment. Thyssenkrupp also declined to comment, saying that merger control proceedings had not officially been opened yet.

2018-06-13,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and India’s Tata Steel are struggling to get the planned merger of their European steel operations on track due to diverging values of their businesses, people familiar with the matter said. Since the two struck an initial deal in September, Thyssenkrupp’s businesses have performed better than Tata Steel’s, requiring both firms to reassess what their operations are worth and potentially rethink the deal, four sources said. The so-called valuation gap could be anywhere between 500 million and 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion), one source said. However, another source told Reuters that it might be smaller than this as valuations were based on the future, not past, performance of the businesses being combined. Options now include adjusting the amount of debt both groups will transfer to the venture or Tata Steel making a cash payment to Thyssenkrupp to settle the difference or changing the 50-50 ownership of the planned entity, the sources said. Of these, the third option was the least likely scenario, although a solution could involve more than one option. “Changing this structure is not on the table,” one of the people said. Although Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board was scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the joint venture, it was not expected to make a decision, the people said. A Thyssenkrupp spokesman said after the board meeting that the company was sticking to its communicated timeframe for the joint venture and aimed to make a decision in June.  Tata Steel declined to comment. Thyssenkrupp has come under investor pressures to seek better terms following a divergence of the operating performance of both entities since the joint venture, which will create Europe’s No.2 steelmaker, was first announced. Talks have already gone on for more than two years and the fact that there is still no final deal - now scheduled for the end of June - has caused concern among key shareholders, including activists Cevian and Elliott. The initial memorandum of understanding foresees a 50-50 ownership split, with Thyssenkrupp’s steel business accounting for a bigger share of the combined profit. To address this, Thyssenkrupp will transfer about 4 billion euros of debt, more than Tata Steel’s 2.5 billion. Changing the ownership structure is Thyssenkrupp’s least preferred option as it would prevent it from deconsolidating its steel business, the sources said. It would also raise the question over an agreed equal representation on the joint venture’s management and supervisory boards, seen as key by labour unions. Alternatively, Thyssenkrupp could transfer more liabilities than previously planned and Tata Steel might lower its debt contribution - or simply compensate its German partner in cash. “In defining the debt level you have to make sure that the new company is viable,” one of the people said.

2018-07-18,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will launch measures on Thursday designed to prevent a surge of steel imports into the bloc following the U.S. imposition of tariffs on incoming steel and aluminium. The European Commission has proposed a combination of a quota and a tariff to counter EU concerns that steel products no longer imported into the United States would instead flood European markets. The measures announced on Wednesday are the third part of the EU’s response to U.S. tariffs. It has also imposed tariffs on 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of U.S. imports, including bourbon and motor bikes, and has launched a legal challenge at the World Trade Organization. The quotas for 23 steel product categories have been set at the average of imports over the past three years, with a 25 percent tariff set for volumes exceeding those amounts. The quotas are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. The main exporters of steel to the EU are China, India, Russia, South Korea, Turkey and Ukraine. The Commission said that the EU steel industry was “in a fragile situation and vulnerable to a further increase in imports”, with U.S. tariffs reducing its capacity to sell there  making them even more vulnerable. European steelmakers body Eurofer welcomed the safeguards, but said it expected a short-term surge of imports as steelmakers rushed to fill the quotas. European automakers association ACEA said it regretted the move, which it forecast would inflate prices. European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement that the bloc was faced with no choice but that EU markets would remain open with traditional trade flows. The Commission will continue its investigation until the end of the year. The provisional safeguards can be in place for up to 200 days. Imports of 28 products increased by 62 percent from 2013 to 2017, most noticeably in 2016 and with further rises this year. However, for five products, imports did not increase, leading the Commission to exclude them from its measures. For 12 steel product categories, imports from countries including China, Russia and Ukraine are already subject to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. The Commission said it would consider suspending or reducing them to avoid the imposition of “double duties”. Russian steelmaker NLMK said it hoped to continue business as usual, while peer Severstal said it did not expect a substantial impact on its results. EU manufacturers of the products ranging from hot and cold rolled sheets, plates, coated steel and tubes include ArcelorMittal, Voestalpine and Tata Steel.

2018-09-18,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s steel ministry has proposed increasing the effective import duty on some steel products to 15 percent from current rates ranging from 5 percent to 12.5 percent, according to two sources and a government document reviewed by Reuters, as the country looks to support the rupee. The proposal is a part of a broader government plan to cut “non-necessary” imports to stop an outflow of dollars that has sent the rupee to record lows.  “The broader message is to address the trade balance but we will try to promote ‘Make in India’ by encouraging domestic (steel) production,” said the source, who declined to be named ahead of a possible decision. The source said there was no certainty that the proposed duty would be imposed.  Steel and trade ministry officials were expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss the proposed import steps but the talks did not take place, one of the sources said, without giving details.  The steel and trade ministries did not respond to requests seeking comment. Shares of Indian steel companies jumped after the news. In afternoon trading, JSW Steel Ltd was up 3.3 percent, while Tata Steel Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd rose by more than 2 percent. State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd also rose by more than 2 percent. The broader Nifty metal index rose as much as 2.2 percent, its biggest gain in nearly a week. The Indian government last week announced a slew of steps aimed at stemming a steep decline in the rupee. The currency hit a record low of 72.99 on Tuesday, making it Asia’s worst performer amid a widening trade deficit and an emerging market selloff. It strengthened slightly on Wednesday on talk of central bank selling of the dollar, but is still down more than 13 percent this year. India’s steel imports totaled $6.5 billion in 2017/18, according to official data. In the three months to end-June, the country became a net steel importer for the first time in two years, with foreign supplies reaching 2.1 million tonnes, up 15 percent from a year earlier. Japan and South Korea, with which India has free trade agreements, accounted for 45 percent of the 8.4 million tonnes of steel imported in the latest financial year to end-March. The proposed duties may not apply to those imports, but other steel suppliers such as China, South Africa, Malaysia, Russia and Indonesia could be affected. The steel ministry has proposed higher duties on various products including high-end steel used in electrical appliances. The duty on that type of steel is recommended to triple to 15 percent, the steepest jump.  The steel is also used in power transformers and costs more than $2,060 a ton. India imports 400,000 tonnes of this type  of steel every year from countries including Germany and Russia.  Apart from steel, India is considering raising import duties on some farm commodities, potentially for a few months, although it is wary of the risks of retaliation, said a senior government official with knowledge of inter-ministerial deliberations on proposed restrictions. The government is also looking at curbs on imports of gold and high-end electronic items, a trade ministry source said last week. India is the world’s second-biggest gold buyer, and its imports in August rose more than 90 percent to $3.64 billion. The World Gold Council, however, warned on Wednesday against any further curbs on the metal which already attracts a 10 percent tariff, the largest India has imposed. “Indian demand is down 7 percent over last year which itself was down over the previous year,” the industry body’s India managing director, Somasundaram PR, said at an industry event. “There are discussions about non-essential imports, but I still believe and I hope that this does not actually in any sense hit gold this time.”  ($1 = 72.7225 Indian rupees) Reporting by Neha Dasgupta; Additional reporting by Manoj Kumar; Writing by Krishna N.

2018-06-27,"DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are nearing a 15 billion euro ($17.4 billion) deal this week to combine their European assets into a global steel giant, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. Talks to hammer out the final details are progressing well and a compromise has been reached on closing a valuation gap between the businesses, three of the people said. The combination of Thyssenkrupp’s and Tata Steel’s European steel assets, first announced in September, would create the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with 15 billion euros in combined sales. Sources told Reuters this month that the compromise options included a cash payment to Thyssenkrupp, changing the 50-50 ownership structure of the venture, lowering the debt to be transferred to it, or limiting dividend payments to Tata Steel for a number of years. “Talks are very constructive, they are on the final stretches,” one of the people said. Negotiations are ongoing and could still be delayed or collapse at the last moment, the people said, adding that both companies had a great interest in getting a deal done. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel both declined to comment. Shares in Thyssenkrupp extended gains and were up 3.1 percent at 1250 GMT, topping Frankfurt’s blue-chip index. The joint venture was originally planned to be signed in early 2018 but was delayed after Thyssenkrupp’s steel business performed much better than Tata Steel’s, requiring a reassessment of the deal. Signing is now planned by the end of June, but due to disagreement over the size of the valuation gap — with estimates ranging from 500 million to 3 billion euros — that timeline, too, has been called into question. While giving Thyssenkrupp boss Heinrich Hiesinger more leverage in negotiations, the gap has also enabled activist fund Elliott, who disclosed a stake in the steel-to-submarines group last month, to put more pressure on the CEO to deliver. German labor unions, which control half of the seats on Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, have expressed general support for the deal, saying last week they would be prepared to let talks run longer if it results in a better outcome. Tata Steel Europe’s labor representatives are also close to approving the deal, two people familiar with the matter said.

2018-07-06,"DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp will take its time to replace Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger after his resignation, dampening hopes of a speedy restructuring or even a break-up of the German industrial group. Hiesinger’s resignation came less than a week after he sealed a landmark joint venture deal with India’s Tata Steel, the culmination of two years of negotiations that in the end came too late to placate investors hungry for change. Activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott had criticised Thyssenkrupp’s performance under Hiesinger, with shares down 28 percent since he took office in January 2011. There have been calls to break up the company that spans submarines, elevators and car parts. The board did not appoint an interim CEO but said it had asked the remaining executives — Guido Kerkhoff, Oliver Burkhard and Donatus Kaufmann — to lead the company for now. “In this difficult situation it is most important now for the company to remain on course,” the supervisory board’s Chairman Ulrich Lehner said in a statement. The chief executive had been set to present a revamped strategy for the group, which was forged by the merger of two German steel groups founded in the 19th century. Such a  presentation now looks likely to be delayed. “The succession to Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger as Chief Executive will follow in a structured process,” Thyssenkrupp said, without providing details on possible candidates or a timeline. Thyssenkrupp’s stock jumped as much as 6.6 percent to the top of the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 index on Friday before giving up some of its gains to trade 1.7 percent higher by 1415 GMT. Hiesinger, 58, was brought in to turn around Thyssenkrupp seven years ago after it lost billions of euros in an ill-fated venture in the Americas that forced his predecessor Ekkehard Schulz to step down. The former Siemens executive vowed to fix the “disaster” at the group, axing half his management board amid losses and corruption allegations.  He presided over Thyssenkrupp’s protracted exit from its volatile steel business, whose roots go back more than 200 years and provided the company’s backbone for many generations. But his shareholder backing dwindled during his quest to simplify the group’s structure while still keeping it intact. “We welcome the CEO’s resignation as this could be a sign of a change of strategy, a move toward the split of the company’s assets and the end of the conglomerate discount,” said Frederic Guignard, European Equities Fund Manager at Aviva Investors, a top-30 investor in Thyssenkrupp. Breaking up conglomerates is tougher in Germany than, for example, in the United States, mainly because of the power of labour unions on German company boards.     “Now there is an opportunity to develop a new strategy, to advance restructuring and to reposition the group,” said Ingo Speich, fund manager at Union Investment, which holds about $28.5 million worth of Thyssenkrupp stock. “A successor should therefore add a new perspective rather than hold on to the existing strategy,” he added. The resignation was the fourth by a German blue-chip company’s CEO in as many months, after the chiefs of Deutsche Bank, Volkswagen and Beiersdorf. Hiesinger “was apparently sick of letting himself be worn down by divergent interests at Thyssenkrupp,” Independent Research analyst Sven Diermeier said. Hiesinger himself said in a letter to staff that a “joint understanding of board and supervisory board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company”. The Krupp family foundation is Thyssenkrupp’s biggest shareholder, without around 21 percent of shares, followed by Cevian with around 18 percent. Elliott has under 3 percent, according to its latest filing. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Cevian partner Jens Tischendorf and former Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Rene Obermann voted against the deal with Tata, while HSBC Germany chief Carola von Schmettow abstained at last week’s board meeting. Some key shareholders said the terms of the Tata deal were not favourable enough and that Hiesinger could have sought a better deal. It was unclear to what extent the traditionally tight-lipped Krupp foundation supported the venture, but it said on Friday that it regretted Hiesinger’s decision to leave and that it had always welcomed his proposals and supported his decisions.

2018-02-12,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA and a group led by Russia’s VTB have made separate bids for India’s Essar Steel, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and faces claims of nearly $8 billion. ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has offered a “detailed industrial plan” for Essar Steel aimed at improving its performance and profitability, it said in a statement on Monday after the bidding deadline. The group Numetal, which said it is led by VTB, has submitted a bid for Essar Steel, it said in a statement.  Numetal said it has other minority shareholders, but did not say who they were. Indian media have reported Essar’s founder Ruia family has a small stake in Numetal. Essar Steel was among a dozen of India’s biggest debt defaulters that were pushed to bankruptcy court last year after a central bank order aimed at clearing a $147 billion bad loan mountain at the nation’s banks that is choking new lending. Banks and other creditors and suppliers have staked claims of 507.78 billion rupees ($7.89 billion) from Essar Steel, according to Indian government data. For ArcelorMittal, which has long sought to build its own plant in India, Essar provides “a compelling opportunity”, the European steelmaker’s Indian-born chief Lakshmi Mittal said in the statement. ArcelorMittal had earlier been expected to also bid for secondary steelmaker Bhushan Steel and Power, which is also in bankruptcy proceedings, but did not submit a bid. Two of India’s biggest steelmakers JSW Steel and Tata Steel are bidding for Bhushan. Last week, ArcelorMittal sold its entire stake in India’s Uttam Galva Steels to the Indian company’s founders, a move seen as clearing the way for new steel bids.

2018-11-20,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp’s 2019 forecast for a marked recovery at most of its divisions drew a tepid market response, suggesting its new CEO faces a struggle to restore trust in the German industrials group after warning on profit twice this year. Guido Kerkhoff, who took over in September, hopes to win back investor confidence by spinning off the elevators, car parts and plant engineering businesses into one division, a move that has so far failed to lift the conglomerate’s shares. A profit warning earlier this month has also raised doubts over the group’s transformation plan, while a supervisory board disagreement over the appointment of outgoing Daimler finance chief Bodo Uebber as a member, and potentially as chairman, added to the uncertainty. Uebber’s demand to raise compensation for board members drew fire from employee representatives, a person familiar with the matter said, adding his appointment was now off the table. A spokesman for Uebber declined to comment. Taking into account the expected close of a European steel joint venture with Tata Steel, Thyssenkrupp said it expects adjusted operating profit to rise to more than 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) in the 2018/19 financial year. That is an increase of at least 42 percent from the 706 million euros the group reported for 2017/18 and is based on the view that almost all its divisions will show a marked improvement compared with 2017/18. It also expects free cash flow from continuing operations to improve but remain negative and sales to grow by a low single-digit percentage. Barclays analysts deemed the guidance “underwhelming”, adding that “revenue growth ... looks optimistic in light of the current macro backdrop.” Shares on Wednesday initially rose 2.9 percent before falling by as much as 1.5 percent. By 1438 GMT they were trading 2.2 percent higher. They have fallen 29 percent since the corporate split was announced, also burdened by possible cartel fines and underperformance at the elevators and car parts divisions, its two most promising units. “The past fiscal year was a turbulent and challenging one for Thyssenkrupp. We initiated one of the biggest realignments in the history of the company,” Kerkhoff said. “At the same time we identified potential for further improvements in all businesses which we are now systematically addressing.” Thyssenkrupp has faced calls for years to simplify its structure which makes everything from submarines and steel to chemicals plants and automotive components, with investors arguing the complex setup destroys value. The group on Wednesday also provided a timeline for the corporate split, expecting the spin-off documents to be presented at its next annual press conference before a shareholder meeting in January 2020 to approve the move.

2018-08-09,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian authorities arrested a former managing director of Bhushan Steel Ltd on Thursday over an alleged fraud, after a probe found billions of rupees had been siphoned off by the firm’s founders from funds borrowed from state-run banks. Neeraj Singhal, a member of the founding family, was presented before a court and will be held in judicial custody until Aug. 14, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs said in a statement. It is fairly rare for influential industrialists or corporate leaders to be arrested over fraud allegations in India, but efforts to clean up state banks’ bad loans has put more scrutiny on their financial transactions.  Bhushan Steel was among a dozen companies pushed to bankruptcy court last year amid a government drive to whittle down a $150 billion mountain of bad loans choking credit at Indian banks. The company, which owed more than $8 billion to creditors, was taken over in May by Tata Steel in a more than $5 billion deal. Singhal was indicted for “indulging in serious corporate fraud punishable” under law, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, said. The government alleged that the founders of Bhushan Steel had used a “multitude of complex, fraudulent manoeuvres to divert/siphon-off funds” amounting to billions of rupees that had been borrowed from state-run banks, causing losses to both banks and investors. “Another blow to Crony capitalism. No mercy for siphoning off public money,” Rajeev Kumar, the government’s top bureaucrat overseeing the country’s banking sector, said in a Twitter post.

2018-03-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - A new pension fund backed by Tata Steel UK, a unit of India’s Tata Steel, will be set up after meeting minimum size and funding criteria, paving the way for the firm’s merger with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp. The trustee of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS), a 124,000 member final salary scheme from previous owner British Steel, said in a statement the new BSPS would go ahead on March 28 as planned. “This is very good news for the 83,000 members who wanted to receive their benefits from the New Scheme and chose to switch to it,” said Alan Johnston, who will now act as chairman to the trustee of the New BSPS. Britain’s pensions regulator agreed a deal last year to allow Tata Steel UK to cut scheme benefits and set up a new BSPS in return for a 550 million pound one-off payment to the scheme. Tata Steel UK remains the formal backer of the New BSPS. Earlier this year, UK lawmakers said Britain’s markets watchdog was too slow to prevent “vulture” financial advisers from ripping off steelworkers faced with critical decisions over their 14 billion pound ($19.6 billion) pension scheme. Some 25,000 scheme members failed to opt to transfer into the new scheme, meaning they end up in a lifeboat known as the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) by default, potentially a worse outcome for them. Alternatively, some of the 25,000 might have opted to transfer their pension into other investments, but many who took that option were encouraged by dubious financial advisers to sign up to risky, unsuitable investments. After Tata’s pension hurdle was overcome last year, Thyssenkrupp and Tata agreed to merge their European steel operations to create the continent’s No.2 steelmaker. The deal is expected to be finalised late this year.

2018-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s steel industry is vulnerable despite recovering from a 2015 crisis, with many challenges that led to thousands of job cuts still not resolved and risks related to Brexit looming, the chief executive of Tata Steel UK said on Tuesday. “Currently our nose is above water but our lips are below.Any additional burden can still take us down,” said Bimlendra Jha, speaking at a conference in London organised by EEF, Britain’s largest manufacturing industry representative.  The UK steel industry is emerging from a crisis that led to the loss of about 7,000 steel jobs, about a quarter of the workforce, between September 2015 and March 2017. Steel prices in the European Union ST-MBEUDNHRC-MB have nearly doubled since plunging in early 2016 to their lowest in about a decade. But the British steel industry remains vulnerable, with business rates still about 18 times higher than in neighbouring EU countries and electricity costs about 50 percent higher, the same issues that hurt the industry in the crisis. To protect vulnerable industries from the effects of Britain’s departure from the European Union, the government launched an industrial strategy in November, but it has yet to finalise details of the deal for the steel industry. Britain’s exit from the EU in 2019 could destabilise the steel industry, particularly if trade defences that replace those of the EU prove less effective in stopping dumping or subsidised steel from entering Britain. Steel dumping, especially from China, was a major cause of the 2015 sector crisis. “I think we’ll lose out post-Brexit,” said Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, referring to plans for a customs bill that will provide a framework to prevent unfair trade after Brexit. Steel, the second most used material in the world after cement, often makes its way up Britain’s political agenda because it is seen as a strategic industry for manufacturing and because the metal is used in sensitive military applications.

2018-07-10,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp’s workers and its leading shareholder will serve as an anchor of stability at the company following the sudden departure of Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger, they told a German regional newspaper. The remarks by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp’s top shareholder with a 21 percent stake, are the first in several years to address the company’s strategy, which has come under fire from activist investors. Cevian, Thyssenkrupp’s second-largest shareholder with an 18 percent stake, has demanded that the sprawling group must be simplified, should grant more independence to its business units and explore strategic options for them. But Ursula Gather — head of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation — and Markus Grolms, trade union secretary at the IG Metall union and vice chairman of the group’s supervisory board, suggested that radical change was not the answer. “The foundation and labour representatives have always stood up for the stability of the company. That will not change in the future,” they jointly told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ). Between them, the foundation and labour representatives hold 12 of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, giving them a clear majority to block key strategic decisions. Both had voted in favour of a historic steel tie-up with Tata Steel. Gather has faced criticism for not backing Hiesinger strongly enough in the face of fierce opposition from activist investors, including Cevian and Elliott, with some sources saying this played a role in the CEO leaving so abruptly. Hiesinger, which had led the elevator-to-submarines group since January 2011, unexpectedly resigned last week, just days after the deal with Tata Steel was signed. Armin Laschet, state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia where Thyssenkrupp is headquartered, will meet finance chief Guido Kerkhoff and chief human resources officer Oliver Burkhard on Thursday to discuss the situation, government sources said. Laschet also holds a seat on the foundation’s board. The meeting, first reported by Rheinische Post, will also include Grolms and Knut Giesler, head of IG Metall in North Rhine-Westphalia. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. The group on Friday said it would start a structured process to find a successor to Hiesinger. Analysts at Credit Suisse said Stefan Kirsten, who served as Thyssenkrupp’s finance chief between 2002-2006, would be an “interesting option”. Kirsten, 57, recently stepped down from his post as finance chief at real estate group Vonovia.

2018-07-10,"After the recent setbacks, JSW Steel is now looking to focus on buying more niche, lower capacity plants which do not require huge investments to turn around, said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and the group financial head of JSW Steel. “In the next round, our strategic thinking is to now focus on special product units that generally have a capacity of about a million tonnes,” said Rao, referring to an upcoming round of auctions under India’s new bankruptcy law, during which a second wave of steel assets will be up for grabs. India’s steel demand has been growing at over 8 percent for the last few months. The growth is being led by higher motorcycle and automobile sales and government-sponsored infrastructure projects. Rao said that JSW Steel is scouting for opportunities in the specialized steel segment that are dedicated to meeting specific customer demands. He did not name the prospective targets. JSW has steelmaking capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, around 13 percent of India’s installed capacity. It is investing 268 billion rupees ($3.9 billion) over the next three years to expand to 24 million tonnes. By 20230, JSW plans to increase its capacity to 40 million tonnes in India and 10 million tonnes overseas. Buoyed by its two recent acquisitions of relatively smaller steel plants in the United States and Italy, the company is now looking for similar-sized plants elsewhere in Europe. “There are five or six mainly downstream projects that we’re evaluating,” said Rao, adding the strategy would be similar to its acquisition plans in India. In March, JSW bought Acero Junction Holdings for $80.85 million in the United States and Italy’s Aferpi for 55 million euros in May. Together, along with its plate and pipe mill in the U.S., it now has a total overseas capacity of 4 million tonnes per year.  “I think both the acquisitions we’ve announced fit well with our strategy,” Rao said.

2018-05-24,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Elliott said on Thursday it would step up  pressure on Thyssenkrupp’s leadership to revive the German industrial conglomerate’s fortunes, confirming it had taken a stake of less than 3 percent. The stake increases the influence of interventionist investors on the group, which already counts Sweden’s Cevian as its second-largest shareholder. Cevian has called for a broad strategic review of the sprawling elevators-to-submarines group. “Elliott believes Thyssenkrupp has significant scope for operational improvement which would benefit all stakeholders,” Elliott said in a brief statement, adding it would soon seek to start a constructive dialogue with the group’s boards. Those talks will reveal Elliott’s desire for far-reaching changes at the conglomerate, whose shares have fallen more than a fifth since CEO Heinrich Hiesinger took the job in 2011. The STOXX Europe 600 Industrial Goods & Services Index has risen more than two thirds over the same period. Investors have become more vocal in criticising management for being too slow in selling a legacy steel business into a joint venture with Tata Steel, a move aimed at revealing the value of Thyssenkrupp’s higher-tech businesses. Elliott did not disclose the exact size of its stake, only saying that, as of Thursday, it did not exceed any thresholds forcing it to reveal it. Under German capital market rules, the first such threshold is 3 percent. The move puts Hiesinger under pressure to launch a more radical overhaul, which some shareholders have suggested might be difficult to deliver under the existing management, or break up the firm, an idea he has resisted in the past with the backing of Supervisory Board Chairman Ulrich Lehner. The chief executive is due to outline refinements to his existing strategy in a few weeks. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. Shares in Thyssenkrupp traded 1.6 percent higher at 0849 GMT. They had posted their biggest single-day gain in almost a decade earlier this week when news about Elliott’s stake first emerged.  The investment is also in line with a pickup in the U.S. hedge fund’s activity in Europe this year, with sources saying Elliott sees a chance in a region where activist funds are usually less present. A day earlier, Elliott, led by Paul Singer, raised its stake in German energy group Uniper to 8.03 percent, ahead of a shareholder meeting where it is trying to appoint a special auditor to investigate management.

2018-09-27,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp will split into two companies, one focused on capital goods and the other on materials, giving in to years of investor pressure and undergoing its biggest overhaul since the merger of Thyssen and Krupp 20 years ago. The group said on Thursday it would spin off its elevators, car parts and plant engineering businesses to shareholders, with Thyssenkrupp Materials, the company that will hold the remaining assets, initially retaining a minority stake.    “We are planning the creation of two independent companies with a common DNA and strong roots in a joint history spanning more than 200 years,” Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said in a statement. “Now we are proposing a solution that not only creates value for our shareholders but also significantly improves the prospects for our businesses.” The plans are a major victory for activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott, which have demanded changes to improve the group’s operational performance, pointing to its overly complex conglomerate structure. They are also a bold step by Kerkhoff, who was recently brought in as a stopgap manager amid turmoil on the executive board. He said his current management team was fully capable of implementing the proposed split into two companies. Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board is due to sign off on the plans at an extraordinary meeting on Sunday, Sept. 30, which also marks the end of the company’s financial year. Shares in Thyssenkrupp rose as much as 17 percent after the official announcement, which came after Reuters reported exclusively that the group was considering the separation of major business divisions. “While there is a long road ahead and execution risk remains, we believe this would be a key positive catalyst for TKA (Thyssenkrupp) driving a significant re-rating towards cap goods peers,” Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld wrote. Thyssenkrupp’s strategy shift comes as rival conglomerates including Siemens and General Electric are slimming down. The group has been in crisis since the sudden departure of both its chief executive and chairman in July, under pressure from shareholders dissatisfied over a lack of action and concerned that a steel joint venture with Tata Steel did not go far enough in simplifying the business. Cevian, Thyssenkrupp’s second largest shareholder with an 18 percent stake and holder of a seat on the group’s 20-member supervisory board, said it fully supported the restructuring. “This will reduce complexity, promote entrepreneurial freedom and agility, and enhance the ability of the ThyssenKrupp’s businesses to realize their potential,” its co-founder Lars Foerberg said in a statement. Thyssenkrupp has in the past said it wanted to focus on strengthening its capital goods business, which will now be renamed Thyssenkrupp Industrials, and last year raised about 1.4 billion euros ($1.64 billion) to do that. Shareholders in Thyssenkrupp will continue to hold all of Thyssenkrupp Materials, which will comprise materials services, a 50 percent stake in the joint venture with Tata Steel, slewing bearings and forging businesses and a marine business. Both Thyssenkrupp Materials and Thyssenkrupp Industrials will be listed, and liabilities and pension obligations are to be allocated between the two, Thyssenkrupp said. The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp’s largest investor with a 21 percent stake, said it would not oppose a solution that secured competitiveness and jobs. The group’s powerful labour representatives, which control half of the supervisory board’s seats, also backed the plans. “This step prevents a break-up of Thyssenkrupp. A sell-off of business will not happen,” said Markus Grolms, interim supervisory board chairman and secretary at IG Metall, Germany’s biggest labour union.

2018-12-07,"DUESSELDORF/LONDON (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and India’s Tata Steel are close to deciding who will lead their planned European steel joint venture, four people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Settling on the venture’s leadership has been delayed by a strategy crisis and change of CEO at the German industrial conglomerate, which has said it would split into two companies. The holdup has riled the Thyssenkrupp workforce. A labour leader on Wednesday said there would be “trouble” if the matter was not resolved soon. Andreas Goss, head of Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit, is the front runner to become chief executive of the combined entity, which will be Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, the people said. The new company will have around 48,000 workers and about 17 billion euros ($19.4 billion) in sales, with production facilities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Goss, seen as well connected in the industry, has led Thyssenkrupp’s steel division since 2014. The unit’s adjusted operating profit rose by 26 percent to 687 million euros over the past financial year. His appointment would further strengthen Thyssenkrupp’s position in the 50-50 venture, which already includes a greater share of proceeds should the entity be listed on the stock exchange, which is widely expected. Signed in June, the planned entity still needs European antitrust approval, which is expected towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. The groups might have to divest assets to secure approval, sources have previously said. Hans Fischer, chief executive of Tata Steel’s European subsidiary, is also likely to join the venture’s management board, the people said, adding it was unclear how many seats the board would have. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in June said the joint venture’s management board would consist of six members, shared equally between both groups. That number could be reduced to four to give a more focused structure to the entity, which will be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the people said. A decision will be announced very soon, the people said. Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said last month a decision on the joint venture’s leadership would be made before Christmas. “The joint venture would have a two-tier management structure comprising a management board and a supervisory board,” a Tata Steel spokesman said. “Both boards would have equal representation from Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel,” he said, adding further announcements will be made “in due course”. When asked about the issue, a spokesman for Thyssenkrupp referred back to Kerkhoff’s remarks.

2018-08-24,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s top steelmaker Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp sees India as the most promising market and wants to become “an insider” to capitalise on growth of the world’s third-biggest steel market, a senior executive said. “India will be the fastest-growing steel market in the world going forward,” Nippon Steel Executive Vice President Katsuhiro Miyamoto told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. “But since it’s not an easy market to export to due to trade and distribution issues, it’s important for us to become an insider. That’s why we are bidding for Essar Steel,” he said.      Nippon Steel has teamed up with Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, to bid around $6 billion for bankrupt Essar Steel, India’s 4th-biggest steelmaker. But the bidding process has been delayed due to legal battles over eligibility for the bidders.  Asked if he thinks the chances are in their favour in the bidding race, Miyamoto said: “We have always believed so.” “We have submitted all the documents requested to the    National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and we expect their decision by the end of this month,” he said.  World Steel Association (WSA) forecast steel demand in India will climb 5.5 percent in 2018 and 6 percent in 2019, becoming the fastest-growing market among the world’s top ten steel consumption countries.  Even so, Japan’s steel exports to India nearly halved in 2016 after India imposed duties of up to 20 percent on some hot-rolled flat steel products in September 2015. India also set a floor price in February 2016 for steel product imports to deter countries such as China, Japan and South Korea from undercutting local mills.  Since then, Japan’s annual steel exports to India have been hovering at around 1.3 million tonnes, just 3 percent of the country’s total exports of the metal.  Nippon Steel has a joint venture with India’s Tata Steel to produce cold-rolled sheets for automobiles, but it has little presence in steel used in other areas in the South Asian nation.  “If we can buy Essar, it will give us access to India’s general steel users including builders,” Miyamoto said.  Nippon Steel said in March it will spend 600 billion yen  ($5.4 billion) for business investment, including for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), over the next three years. That would be up from 210 billion yen spent over the previous three years to step up global expansion.

2018-01-09,"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.) By Una Galani MUMBAI, Jan 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Kumar Mangalam Birla is shifting gears. The Indian tycoon has been feverishly tidying up his cement-to-textiles empire, based around the flagship Aditya Birla Group. Now a $2.5 billion bid from affiliate Hindalco for U.S. aluminium products-maker Aleris, as reported by Bloomberg, suggests growth is back on the agenda. Birla has been busy. Last year he agreed to merge his local telecoms operator, Idea Cellular, with Vodafone India after Mukesh Ambani’s Jio upended the market, and also completed the complex merger of two holding companies. Now Hindalco, his separately listed $10 billion metals giant, is on the prowl, as one of several mooted bidders for Aleris. Private equity-owned Aleris is back on the block after U.S. officials raised national-security concerns about a $2.3 billion sale to the Chinese-backed Zhongwang USA. By contrast, Indian bidders carry less stigma thanks to New Delhi’s relatively lower barriers to inward investment, and because there is less controversy about Indian manufacturers “dumping” cheap products abroad. The prospect of an Indian metals giant venturing overseas conjures memories of the ill-fated acquisition of Corus, the Anglo-Dutch group, by Tata Steel, which is now being offloaded into a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp of Germany. But this deal is much smaller, relative to the buyer, which makes it less risky for Hindalco. And Birla is an experienced dealmaker too: the mooted acquiring unit, Novelis, was itself was acquired by the tycoon in 2007 for around $6 billion. At about 12 times trailing EBITDA, Aleris would be expensive relative to Hindalco’s own 8.5 times. It is always risky to pay a high multiple in cyclical industries such as metals. But the Indian magnate is apparently betting on increased demand for strong, lightweight aluminium amid the uptake of electric vehicles, which tend to use more of this metal, and tougher rules on fuel emissions, which should drive increased usage in traditional cars too. That looks smart. Ducker Worldwide reckons the use of aluminium in cars will increase by up to 30 percent by 2025. And brokerage Kotak reckons automotive sheet demand in North America will probably result in a supply deficit for rolled products, a form of aluminium used in car-making. That, in turn, will help producers charge more. If so, the original price tag would look more lightweight too. - India’s Hindalco has submitted a $2.5 billion bid for aluminium producer Aleris, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 4, citing people with knowledge of the matter. - Mumbai-listed Hindalco made a non-binding offer through its privately held U.S. unit, Novelis, the sources added. - Ohio-based Aleris is owned by Oaktree Capital and Apollo Global Management. Aleris had earlier agreed to sell itself to Zhongwang USA for an enterprise value of $2.3 billion. That deal was scrapped after U.S. officials raised national security concerns about the Chinese-backed bidder. - Hindalco has a market capitalisation of $9.8 billion. - For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on Editing by Quentin Webb and Katrina Hamlin",https://in.reuters.com/article/hindalco-india-breakingviews/breakingviews-indian-tycoon-has-golden-opportunity-in-aluminium-idINL4N1P506X

2018-05-13,"* Loans: Onshore volatility, regulation change add to appeal for borrowers to go offshore By Krishna Merchant and Prakash Chakravarti SINGAPORE, May 14 (IFR) - Volatile domestic markets and a relaxation of overseas borrowing rules are sending more Indian companies into the offshore loan markets. The Reserve Bank of India last month relaxed the external commercial borrowing (ECB) regime, raising the maximum interest rate and widening the pool of eligible borrowers to include housing finance companies. The change opens an alternative source of funding for Indian issuers who are facing higher interest rates in the domestic market. Housing Development Finance Corp, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Housing and Urban Development Corp are among the companies considering offshore loans. “We shall now have a greater predictability in our fundraising plans and it offers a certain degree of flexibility in terms of deployment,” said Ajit Mittal, executive director at Indiabulls Housing Finance. Frequent borrowers such as Rural Electrification Corp and Power Finance Corp are also looking to benefit. Last week REC sent a request for proposals for a five-year loan of at least US$250m, marking its return to the offshore loan market after only a couple of months. PFC is also exploring dollar loans, although it mandated four banks last month on a 10-year dollar bond. Small Industries Development Bank of India, a frequent bond issuer in the onshore market, has sent out a request for proposals for a Rs50bn (US742m) five-year offshore Masala bond. The move follows Sidbi’s cancellation of a Rs5bn tap of its 2021 rupee bonds late last month. ONSHORE SPIKE Conditions remain challenging in the onshore debt markets, where risk appetite among lenders is weak following a series of scams and scrutiny on lending practices that have hit the country’s banks. A spike in bond yields has made matters worse, while the introduction of a more efficient electronic system for bond issues from April 1 is having the unintended effect of raising costs for the country’s borrowers. “Investors are asking for higher levels, the bid sizes are not enough and yields have spiked [in the onshore bond market]. This has prompted issuers to tap overseas borrowing by the ECB route,” said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income at Edelweiss Financial Services. Late last month the central bank set a single all-in-cost ceiling of 450bp over six-month Libor for dollar bonds and loans, replacing a maximum spread of 300bp at three to five years and 450bp at five years or more. Housing finance companies and port trusts will also be eligible to borrow overseas, subject to hedging requirements. It is not all smooth sailing in the offshore markets, however. A sell-off in the global market due to rising US Treasury yields forced JSW Steel to scrap plans for a dollar bond. In March, the Indian steelmaker met investors and held calls for a 144A/Reg S offering of five to 10-year bonds. The company is now eyeing a dollar loan of US$300m with a greenshoe of a similar amount and five to 10-year maturity. It has an approval from the RBI to raise up to US$750m from the ECB route. CHEAPER THAN BONDS Offshore loans might turn out to be cheaper for Indian borrowers. JSW Steel baulked at paying a potential 6.25% yield on its five-year bond, while its outstanding bonds due in April 2022 were trading at a yield of around 6.20%, or 320bp over Libor. JSW Steel would be able to raise five-year money through a dollar loan at a much tighter level of around 240bp–250bp over Libor, according to loan bankers. “We are looking at all possible sources to raise funds to finance growth,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel. The company’s most recent visit to the loan markets was in March for a US$244m-equivalent trade finance loan from Japan Bank for International Cooperation and commercial banks. Nippon Export & Investment Insurance provided the cover for the commercial portions. Prior to that, JSW Steel’s last loan was a US$250m five-year facility in March 2015 with seven banks. That loan paid a top level all-in of 325bp over Libor via a margin of 306bp over Libor. A new loan will compete with a US$1.86bn-equivalent six-year financing for Tata Steel that is in general syndication. The loan has 23 lenders in the arranger group and follows Tata Steel’s US$1.3bn 5.5 and 10-year bond that printed in January paying coupons of 4.45% and 5.45%, respectively.

2018-09-30,"ESSEN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp acted to end its leadership and strategy crisis on Sunday, as its supervisory board filled its two top management posts and approved plans to split the German conglomerate in two. The move follows months of turmoil at the elevators-to-submarines group, including a profit warning and pressure from activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott, and paves the way for the company’s largest restructuring in decades. Bernhard Pellens, a member of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board since 2005, was unanimously appointed as new chairman to replace Ulrich Lehner, who left the group in July less than two weeks after CEO Heinrich Hiesinger quit. Guido Kerkhoff, 50, was appointed CEO on a five-year contract, Thyssenkrupp said, confirming him in a role he had been filling on an acting basis since Hiesinger’s resignation. “I would like to thank the supervisory board for the confidence and the clear support it has given to the planned new set-up of Thyssenkrupp proposed by the executive board,” Kerkhoff said in a statement. “Our solution is responsible and equally serves the interests of employees, customers and shareholders. We will now decisively start implementation.” Under the planned structure, Thyssenkrupp will spin off its capital goods business - elevators, car parts and plant engineering - into a separate listed entity called Thyssenkrupp Industrials. Materials trading, shipbuilding and the group’s 50 percent stake in a planned joint steel venture with Tata Steel will remain part of Thyssenkrupp, which will be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials. Reuters was first to report last Thursday that Thyssenkrupp was considering a major overhaul, including a separation of business units. Based on pro-forma figures for 2016/17, Thyssenkrupp Industrials had adjusted earnings before interest and taxation of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), while Thyssenkrupp Materials made 550 million euros, according to investor slides published on Sunday. Thyssenkrupp Materials will initially hold a minority stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials, which it will sell down completely at some point, the charts showed. A framework deal between management and labour representatives rules our forced layoffs, supervisory board member Susanne Herberger told Reuters. Approval for the landmark move, announced by the company later on Thursday, was widely expected after it was backed by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation and Cevian, Thyssenkrupp’s two largest shareholders, and labour representatives. The three parties account for 13 seats of the 20-member board, where two seats are vacant after the departure of Lehner and former Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Rene Obermann. The supervisory board’s nomination committee will continue its search to fill the two vacancies. Sources have told Reuters that Cevian, already represented by Jens Tischendorf, was looking to take a second board seat. “With the new set-up, Thyssenkrupp is taking a courageous step forward. Thyssenkrupp now has a convincing plan to bring businesses closer to their customers and increase their performance,” Pellens, 62, said. A professor of business administration and international accounting at the Ruhr University Bochum and honorary professor at Tongji University Shanghai, Pellens also serves as the chairman of the board’s audit committee. Ingo Speich, fund manager at Thyssenkrupp shareholder Union Investment, cautioned that Pellens’ board membership should not exceed 15 years, 13 of which have already passed. “Pellens may be acceptable as supervisory board chairman given the difficult circumstances and the fact that some candidates turned down the job. But he has never led a company and, therefore, can only be an interim candidate,” Speich said. Cevian’s Tischendorf was also appointed to the audit committee, a person familiar with the matter said. Ursula Gather, head of the Krupp foundation, Thyssenkrupp’s largest shareholder, welcomed the appointments of Kerkhoff and Pellens. She added that Pellens had successfully supported and shaped many strategic decisions during his time on the board.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta is in talks to purchase the UK subsidiary of Nigeria’s Diamond Bank as he ramps up efforts to expand the financial services assets in his global business empire. Gupta, executive chairman of $10 billion metals, industrials and energy group GFG Alliance, has been snapping up distressed industrial assets in Britain, Australia and the United States over the past few years. His purchase of Diamond Bank UK, for an undisclosed sum, is subject to UK regulatory approval, having already received approval by Nigerian authorities. It will be renamed British Commonwealth Trade Bank (BCTB) on completion. “Our first bank, Wyelands Bank, saw a gap in effective financial servicing for mid-sized UK industrial companies targeting developed countries. BCTB will enable us to (help) UK businesses access fast-growing markets, especially within the Commonwealth,” Gupta said. “Post-Brexit there will be a heightened need to provide competitive financing to British companies in the commodities and industrial sectors as they seek to grow in new markets globally. BCTB will aim to be the ‘bridge’.” GFG Alliance runs metals group Liberty House and energy and commodities group SIMEC, with assets spanning steelmaking, aluminium smelting, engineering, renewable and non-renewable energy, commodities trading, shipping, property and finance. UK international trade minister Liam Fox welcomed the transaction, saying it is essential that Britain makes the most of trade and investment opportunities as it leaves the European Union. Gupta told Reuters in February that his company has no plans to slow its rapid pace of acquisitions this year and could look to raise capital through debt or equity markets. He plans to spend $1 billion in the next three years to expand his businesses in India, where Liberty House is the preferred bidder for auto component manufacturer Amite Auto India. Born in Punjab, India, Gupta moved to Britain aged 12 and ventured into business at Cambridge University by selling chemical products to Nigeria, where his industrialist father had business interests. He rose to prominence in 2016 when he offered to rescue Tata Steel’s UK assets at the height of a steel market crisis that led to job losses, capacity cuts and bankruptcies worldwide.

2018-07-13,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff was named interim CEO of Thyssenkrupp on Friday and won the backing of the German industrial group’s biggest shareholder, as the search began for a permanent replacement for Heinrich Hiesinger. Hiesinger quit last week after failing to win unanimous shareholder backing for a deal to create a steel venture with India’s Tata Steel. Kerkhoff, 50, will run the company until the process of finding a Hiesinger’s replacement is completed, Thyssenkrupp Chairman Ulrich Lehner said, adding that he enjoyed the “full confidence” of the supervisory board. In a letter to the company’s 158,000 staff, Kerkhoff pledged continuity. “We will stick to our course of restructuring the company into a strong industrial group,” he wrote, promising to develop all business areas, including the steel venture. Activist investors Cevian Capital, which holds an 18 percent stake in Thyssenkrupp, and Elliott have called for an across-the-board strategy review at the Essen-based conglomerate which makes everything from submarines to elevators. They are at odds with the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, which owns a 21 percent stake and represents the legacy of the company’s late owner, whose last wish was for Thyssenkrupp to remain whole. The Krupp foundation’s board met on Friday after facing criticism from labour leaders that it had let down Hiesinger by failing to back him in the wrangling over strategy that preceded his resignation. The foundation expressed its regret over Hiesinger’s resignation and said it “stands by” the company and its workers. The task now ahead was to implement the steel venture with Tata and develop other areas of the business. “The management board headed by Mr Kerkhoff enjoys our full confidence,” foundation chair Ursula Gather said in a statement. The prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, the German state where Thyssenkrupp is based, Armin Laschet, is a member of the foundation’s board. On Thursday, Laschet backed Lehner in rejecting a possible breakup. Thyssenkrupp shares traded down 1.2 percent, making them the second weakest stock in the 30-share DAX index.

2018-07-15,"Handelsblatt reported on Sunday that the Alfried Krupp foundation, which owns 21 percent of Thyssen, and Kone’s largest shareholder Antti Herlin have held talks about a deal. The first conversations took place as early as two years ago, but the proposal was rebuffed by Thyssen’s then-chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger, the paper said.  The foundation said it had told Kone that questions regarding the elevator unit should be referred to Thyssenkrupp. It said it had informed Thyssen’s executive board about the talks, and that it was up to the company to make decisions or respond to queries. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment, while Kone and Antti Herlin were not immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, the Alfried Krupp foundation, which has two seats on Thyssen’s supervisory board, said that a break-up of the industrial conglomerate would not happen, following similar remarks from the company’s chairman. Chairman Ulrich Lehner had said that there were no plans to divest the group’s elevator unit, its most profitable business, which some investors and analysts have said would rid Thyssenkrupp’s share price of a large conglomerate discount. By contrast, activist investor Cevian, Thyssen’s second-largest shareholder with a 18-percent stake, has been vocal in calling for a strategic review of all of Thyssenkrupp’s business areas, saying each might thrive better in a different set-up. Speculation about Thyssenkrupp’s future intensified following the recent resignation of Hiesinger, who cited a lack of shareholder support, and who has been replaced for the interim by Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff.
