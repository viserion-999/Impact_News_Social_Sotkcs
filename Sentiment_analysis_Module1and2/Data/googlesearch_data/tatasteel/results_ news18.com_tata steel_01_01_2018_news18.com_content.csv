2018-05-18,"Bamnipal has appointed members to Bhushan Steel's board, Tata Steel said in a statement.   Bhushan Steel, which was among a dozen companies pushed to bankruptcy court last year amid a government drive to clear a mountain of bad loans choking credit at Indian banks, has an annual steel-making capacity of about 5.6 million tonnes.

2018-11-13,"Domestic deliveries rose to 4.32 million tonne, which is 58 percent of the group deliveries which rose 15 percent to 7.42 million tonne during the quarter.   ""Strong operational performance was primarily on the back of additional revenue from Bhushan Steel, improved deliveries in the domestic market and better realisation across geographies,"" executive director and chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee told reporters here this evening. He further said the integration and synergies of Bhushan Steel, which the company bought through the bankruptcy process for Rs 35,200 crore during the quarter, have been on track and that is reflected in Bhushan Steel's pre-tax margin of Rs 10,291 per tonne. Chief executive and managing director TV Narendran said the domestic demand has been good and so was the domestic prices have been buoyant. ""The Tata Steel Group has delivered extremely strong results this quarter driven by robust operational performance and favourable business conditions in the home market. ""Despite a seasonally weaker period, we sold 4.32 million tonne across Tata Steel standalone and Bhushan Steel. This demonstrates our strong customer relationships and the strength of our marketing franchise,"" he said. Narendran further said the company continues to work on its strategy of increasing its domestic footprint and will ramp up operations at Bhushan Steel and implement our 5 million tonne per annum expansion at the Kalinganagar facility in Orissa. In line with this, the company has also signed definitive agreements to acquire the 1 million tonne speciality steel business of Usha Martin which will strengthen Tata Steel's capability in longs products, Narendran said. Tata Steel bought Usha Martin for around Rs 4,700 crore during the quarter, though a final approval from the NCLT is awaited. When asked about the European Union launching a probe into the proposed creation of joint venture between Tata Steel Europe and Germany's Thyssenkrupp, Narendran said the company is engaging with the Commission and supporting them. ""We were expecting it to go to phase 2 and we don't feel it is something unusual. The Commission has 90 working days and they have started the process. They have asked us a few questions and we are engaging with them and we are supporting them in the investigation,"" he said. Explaining further, Chatterjee said in the merger control clearance the Commission has made three observations on electrical steel, packaging steel and automotive steel. ""We are in a constructive engagement with the Commission along with Thyssenkrupp and we will work together to address all their concerns in the manner which they would want us to,"" he added. On the issues concerning trade wars, Narendran said, ""global steel industry demand is good. Chinese demand has increased by 7-8 percent in the past eight  months, while its production has grown by 6 percent, which means China is exporting less. Also, there is growth in demand in the US, Europe and Russia."" ""At the same time, there is good demand in India and Southeast Asia. Due to the trade actions, there is some diversion in demand, but the consequences of good macro market and good demand growth has reduced the impact of the tradewars,"" Narendran added. Chatterjee said the group had liquidity of Rs 26,470 crore of which cash/cash equivalent was Rs 14,478 crore and in sanctioned bank loans of Rs 11,992 crore. Its consolidated debt stood Rs 1.04 trillion, rose by Rs 2,065 crore during the quarter driven by a forex loss of Rs 3,528 crore.

2018-08-10,"The appellate tribunal said that Tata Steel UK, a foreign subsidiary of Tata Steel, which was fined by an English Court in February 2018 under UK Act, had a provision of imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or a fine, or both'.   While, the provision in section 29A (d) of IBC, which deals with eligibility, stipulates has been convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more, cannot be equated with Section 33(1)(a) of the UK Act, said NCLAT. We hold that Tata Steel UK', which is the connected person' of Tata Steel Ltd', does not attract the disability. under Section 29A of the I&B Code' and for the said reason, we also hold that Tata Steel Limited' is eligible to file the Resolution Plan'', said NCLAT. Section 29 A of the IBC mandates that a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more is ineligible for submitting a resolution plan. Over the claims of L&T, which had supplied goods and machineries goods over Rs 900 crore, NCLAT said that Tata Steel's resolution plan was fair towards operational creditors of Bhushan Steel which has a total demand of Rs 1,422 crore. The appellate tribunal observed that the company has allotted Rs 1,200 crore for them and L&T plea for a higher priority could not be accepted. We hold that the Resolution Plan' submitted by Tata Steel is fair and equitable to all the, Creditors including the Operational Creditors therefore, no interference is called for, the appellate tribunal said. Moreover, it also declined the plea of Brij Bhushan Singal of the promoters family, contending Tata Steel's Resolution Plan' was illegal as it purports to transfer shares' of the preference shareholders' of Bhushan Steel without their consent for a fixed consideration of Rs 100 as against Rs 2,269 crore. Over the claims of Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Jharkhand that part of the land shown in the resolution plan does not belong to Bhushan Steel and is in illegal possession of the company, NCLAT said that Tata Steel is aware of the proceedings. If the title of land is defective, it cannot be cured upon taking over the assets of the Corporate Debtor' (Bhushan Steel) by the Resolution Applicants', said NCLAT. It further said: ""The Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for the said reason held that remedy available to the Applicant/State of Jharkhand and its Officers, having already initiated and pending against the Corporate Debtor', allowing or rejecting the Resolution Plan' will not affect the legal remedy. Bhushan Steel owed its lenders about Rs 56,000 crore and was among the 12 big loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India last year to undergo insolvency under the new bankruptcy law. On May 15 the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel and this was challenged by Neeraj Singal and L&T before NCLAT. Tata Steel has offered Rs 35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel. It would pay another Rs 1,200 crore over next 12 months to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity. We are not inclined to interfere with the order dated 15th May, 2018, passed by the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) in the case of Bhushan Steel Limited' under challenge in Company Appeals... They are accordingly dismissed,' the appellate tribunal said. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/nclat-upholds-bhushan-steel-sale-to-tata-steel-rejects-issues-over-its-ineligibility-1840713.html
2018-11-10,"One point adrift is overnight joint leader Pentala Harikrishna who drew American Wesley So with the white pieces of the Berlin defence in round six to slip to third place.   Anand looked promising with the Black pieces but Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan had a strong initiative to force a draw. Local challenger Surya Shekhar Ganguly had a disappointing day at office as he managed to score only 0.5/3 and went down to Aronian in his last game of the day with the white pieces in the Italian opening. World Cup champion Aronian looked in some kind of trouble initially but the Armenian star said it was his strategy to deceive Ganguly. ""That's generally my strategy for the game. I tried to create imbalance position just to press Surya on the clock. He is a very solid player. So I thought to create some imbalance and I think I managed to get him excited,"" Aronian, a winner of the 2017 St Louis rapid and blitz title, said. ""At the very last moment, he could still make a draw but I think he thought it's a good moment to have his first win and he lost his way."" Nakamura, world number two in rapid, started the day on a rousing note when he defeated overnight leader Mamedyarov Shakhriyar. Playing white, Mamedyarov had an equal position against the speed chess superstar Nakamura but blundered with a Knight move on the 33rd and there was no coming back and he went on to lose. ""He refused to go for a draw and things simply started going my way. Things became smooth (from round five) after I won the game,"" Nakamura, who outwitted Ganguly and Nihal Sarin in the fifth and sixth rounds, said. Playing each other for the first time on Indian soil, Anand and Pentala Harikrishna had an interesting draw that saw no player taking extra risks. 14-year-old Nihal Sarin had the spectators on their toes as he was on the verge of beating Mamedyarov who managed to hold on with some tricks and then ended in perpetual checks on the 60th move. ""I'm playing quite well here. It's a very good experience, it's my first super tournament and a nice exposure. But I'm not under any extra pressure,"" Sarin, who is the world number one in U-14 section, said.  Results (Round Six): Surya Shekhar Ganguly (1) lost to Levon Aronian (Arm, 4.5); Vidit Gujarati (2.5) beat Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 3); Pentala Harikrishna (3.5) drew with Wesley So (USA, 3); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 3) drew with Viswanathan Anand (3); Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 4.5) beat Nihal Sarin (2).  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/sports/nakamura-jumps-to-joint-lead-anand-draws-at-tata-steel-india-2018-rapid-tournament-1935425.html
2018-11-14,"""I wanted to show the audience what is that I do in some other parts of the world all the time and it was nice to be able to do it here,"" Anand, who played in Kolkata for the first time after the third Goodricke Open in 1992, said.   ""It was just the most magical day for me... Here, I did not have any problem with motivation. It genuinely meant a lot to me to do well here,"" Anand added. The legend was also playing his first competition in India after being dethroned in the 2013 World Championship by Magnus Carlsen at his hometown. ""It's long been a dream of mine. And we have ticked the other boxes, we have good opens, we have strong players. But the one thing that was lacking was frequent visits by the top players in the world. Now we have that. So it meant a lot to me to be able to play here in India and especially here in Kolkata,"" Anand who played his first GM tournament here in 1986 said. In the blitz category, the five-time World Champion of classical chess had last won a bronze medal at the World Championship in December 2017 Riyadh, the same meet where he had also won the rapid title. The American of Japanese descent had a forgettable outing on the final leg where he managed to win four and drew four and suffered a defeat to Pentala Harikrishna in the 11th round. India's youngest Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa did a huge favour to Anand in the last round when he held Nakamura in the final round.  Playing with whites against the 13-year-old Nakamura was on the verge of winning but the wildcard entrant Praggnanandhaa probably displayed the best defensive game of his life to manage a miraculous draw that forced a playoff against Anand. In the play-off, Anand, who is world ranked 11 in blitz, was at his best winning the first in an Italian game.  Nakamura took some risks initially, but Anand displayed a solid game with a one up pawn. They had a rook and pawn endgame where Anand sealed the issue with a superb display. Down 0-1, Nakamura played with a long term strategy in the second game thinking Anand would break down trying to defend. But Anand was at his aggressive best and went in for an all-out attack to put Nakamura in the back foot. Finally, the game was forced in opposite square bishop endgame where Nakamura was forced to concede a draw and hand the title to Anand.  Nakamura gave Anand the best compliment when he said there's no reason why the 48-year-old should stop playing. ""To me what Vishy has done... I am almost certain I won't be playing chess at that age. So it's really remarkable and I think especially if you compare (him) against Gary (Kasparov) for example. Gary kind of came out of retirement to play in St Lucia.  ""And I think Vishy did better than he did. It just shows what a truly amazing chess player he is,"" Nakamura said.  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/sports/viswanathan-anand-seals-blitz-title-in-style-by-beating-hikaru-nakamura-1939421.html

2018-12-17,"Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in June signed a final agreement to create the venture following years of talks, just days before a leadership crisis erupted at the sprawling German industrials group.   Sandip Biswas, a member of Tata Steel's senior management, will become finance chief of the new entity, the groups said. Premal Desai, who serves as the chief financial officer of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit, will complete the board as chief strategy officer. ""The future management board is the right choice to build a strong number two in the European flat steel market,"" Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said. ""I am fully convinced that this Board will successfully lead the integration of the Joint Venture given their extensive technical and operational expertise as well as their broad intercultural experiences."" The appointment of Goss as CEO of the joint venture, which still requires antitrust approval by the EU Commission, was first flagged by Reuters earlier this month, as was the fact that the board would comprise four members. Both groups had originally aimed to have six management board members for the 50-50 venture.

2018-09-15,"The USD 40,000 prize money tournament will feature three top players in the 2800-plus Elo rating, it was announced. The top players include Azerbaijan GM and world number three Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, Armenian GM and world number six Levon Aronian, USA's GM Wesley So who is world number 9, Japanese-American GM and four-time United States champion Hikaru Nakamura who is world number 14 and Russian GM Sergey Karjakin (world number 15).   ""There's a lot of excitement to play here. Hope it revitalises the chess in the region,"" the 48-year-old who is currently ranked 10 in the world said. Anand regained some form at the Sinquefield Cup that ended in August in St Louis, US, after a run of uninspiring performances since May. The first Indian to become a chess GM, Anand went undefeated in the tournament, though he did not manage any wins either, and finished sixth out of 10 participants. Anand is part of the Indian contingent for the Chess Olympiad later this month. It will be his first appearance in the tournament since 2006. Apart from the Indian chess wizard, the Indian GMs include P Harikrishna, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Vidit Gujarati, Nihal Sarin, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa as a total of 11 top-ranked players will comepte in the meet at the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. The participants will play a single round robin (all play all) rapid tournament from November 9-11 followed by a double round robin blitz on the last two days. With an aim to make this a long-term event, Tata Steel vice president Sunil Bhaskaran said, ""We hope it's not a one-off event, there's definitely a plan and it's just the beginning. The idea is to get it into classical format. We are just starting out with the fifty and Twenty overs (rapid and blitz) versions."" Tata Steel has a long-standing association with chess having been the main sponsor of the Wijk aan Zee meet in the Netherlands. ""Tata Steel intends to make this a world class and most sought-after event in professional chess in the years to come,"" Bhaskaran added. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/sports/viswanathan-anand-star-attraction-in-tata-steel-rapid-blitz-in-november-1878475.html
2018-11-15,"While a spokesperson of Tata Sons, which already runs two airlines-- the full-service carrier Vistara in a JV with Singapore Airlines, and the low-cost carrier AirAsia India in JV with Air Asia of Malaysia, refused to comment on ""speculation,"" Jet did not respond to PTI queries on the same.   ""We do not comment on speculation,"" a Tata Sons, which originally owned the present national carrier Air India, spokesperson said when asked for confirmation. Besides Goyal, who along with his family owns 51 percent stake in the carrier, Gulf carrier Etihad Airways holds 24 percent stake in the cash-strapped airline which earlier this week reported Rs 1,261 crore loss for the September quarter against a profit of Rs 71 crore y-o-y,making it the third straight quarters of heavy losses.  This had the airline also putting as many as six of its Boeing 777s on sale to part-fund liquidity. Media reports suggest that the parent company of Vistara, Tata-Singapore Airlines, is looking at all-stock merger with Jet Airways as part of the Tata group's plans to board Goyal's full service carrier. In an exchange filing, Jet Airways described the media reports as speculative. ""...the subject news is speculative in nature and that there is no discussion or decision in the board which would require a disclosure...,"" the airline informed BSE. According to reports, the two sides are inching towards a two-step transaction that would first see Jet Airways merging with Tata-SIA that runs Vistara through a share swap to form a new JV, which will have the Goyal family, Etihad, Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines as its partners. ""We are currently at various stages of discussions with multiple interested parties for both part stake sale in Jet Privilege and fresh equity infusion,"" Agarwal had told analysts during the post-earnings concall Tuesday. He had also said the company hired investment bankers and consulting firms to carry out these tasks. The cash paucity in the country's second largest airline by market share has resulted in delayed payments to some vendors and salaries to a section of its over 16,000 employees.  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/tata-sons-board-likely-to-meet-on-friday-to-decide-on-jet-airways-takeover-1940325.html

2018-07-08,"The Board of Tata Sons had removed Mistry as its chairman on October 24, 2016 and sought his ouster from other group companies. He subsequently resigned from the board of six firms, but dragged Tata Sons and his then interim successor Ratan Tata to the NCLT.   Mistry, in the petition filed under the Companies Act, had claimed that his removal was due to a result of mismanagement by the Board's trustees and “oppression” of minority shareholders of the group.  He had taken over as the chairman of Tata Sons group in 2012 after Ratan Tata announced his retirement. Mistry, who was the sixth chairman of the Tata Sons, was ousted from the position in October 2016. Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd and Sterling Investments Corp — two Shapoorji Pallonji Group entities — in the petition against trustees of Tata Trusts and directors of Tata Sons had alleged abuse of articles of association by outsiders, breakdown of governance and loss of ethical value. The petition claimed that Mistry's removal as chairman and subsequently as director of the board of Tata Sons was a result of “oppression” by promoters who are in-turn owned by Tata Trusts that owns over 68 percent in Tata Sons. The second part of the petition focused on the alleged mismanagement by Tata Sons board and Ratan Tata which caused massive revenue loss for the group. However, Tata Group denied all the charges and said that Mistry was removed because the board had lost confidence in him. It further said that Mistry intentionally and in bad faith leaked sensitive and confidential information causing loss in Tata Group's market value. ""He (Mistry) was appointed at the behest of Tata Trusts and his removal cannot be questioned by minority shareholders,"" the Group's counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi had argued before the tribunal. The Tata Group argued that the law clearly allows removal of a chairperson and director and Mistry was removed by a majority of 7 out of 9. Mistry had not voted for his removal and another official had abstained. NCLT Mumbai's special bench of B S V Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy was expected to deliver its order in the case on July 4, but adjourned it to July 9 as the judgement was not ready. Ahead of the NCLT verdict, Cyrus Mistry had last week questioned the rationale behind some of Tata Group's business transactions done lately. He questioned the sale of the group's telecom arm to Airtel, massive debt-driven acquisitions by Tata Steel and its unequal tie-up with Thyssenkrupp, and a first-ever dip in TCS profit. Questioning the ""free transfer of Tata Teleservices"" to Airtel, the letter said the Tatas did not get any benefit from the deal despite transferring 40 million customers, a large swathe of liberalised spectrum and access to Tata Teles extensive fibre network, while it has immensely benefited the acquirer. Mistry said that he failed to understand the logic of offering Bharti Airtel access to these assets effectively for free. Comparing the massive debt-driven expansion of Tata Steel to its doomed acquisition of Corus, Mistry cautioned against a potential debt burden arising from the Rs 80,000-crore capex (capital expenditure) needed for acquiring Bhushan Steel (Rs 35,000 crore), Bhushan Power & Steel (Rs 24,000 crore through the NCLT) as well as the Rs 23,000-crore expansion of Kalinganagar project.  ""If the commodity cycle and the uptick in steel prices are to change again, leading to a decline in prices, Tata Steel will once again stand highly exposed with serious consequences Tata Sons,"" he warned. In a letter to the directors of Tata Sons, Cyrus Investments Mistry has sought accountability and information from the board of Tata Sons. Mistry family owns 18.34 per cent in Tata Sons, which makes them the single largest individual shareholder in the holding company of the Tata Group. Stating that the board is accountable for governance and performance of the Tata Group as also to the minority shareholders, the letter states that despite staring at several burning issues, ""Tata Sons is hiding behind the veneer of media management to present a rosy picture."" .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/cyrus-mistry-loses-case-against-tata-sons-as-nclt-upholds-ouster-says-ex-chairman-leaked-secrets-1805457.html

2018-12-17,"Wadia filed the complaint in 2016 after he was voted out of some of the group companies, where he was a board member, claiming that Tata and the others had made defamatory statements against him after they removed Cyrus Mistry on October 24, 2016 as the group chairman of Tata Sons.   Wadia was on the boards of group companies like Indian Hotels Company that runs the Taj group of hotels, TCS, TataMotors and Tata Steel among others as an independent director. He was voted out by shareholders at the specially convened general meeting between December 2016 and February 2017. Wadia's counsel Abad Ponda informed a metropolitan magistrate court that the accused persons had alleged that Wadia was acting in concert with Mistry, and thus against the interests of the Tata group as a whole. Wadia in his complaint claimed that he approached the court as he was not satisfied with the explanations the respondents had given him following his letters to them and his complaint seeks to initiate defamation proceedings against them under section 500 of IPC. The magistrate, however, refused to issue process (notice) to Tata Sons observing that it is a company and not an individual person. ""It appears that complainant (Wadia) has made out a case against accused No 2 to 12 (Tata and others) but there is no such case made out against accused No 1 (Tata Sons) for the offence punishable under section 500. Hence issue process against accused No. 2 to 12,"" the magistrate said in his order.  Meanwhile, a Tata Sons spokesperson said all due processes were followed in relation to Nusli Wadia's removal as independent director. ""Tata Sons had, in exercise of its statutory rights, validly issued a 'Special Notice' seeking his removal. While Wadia has alleged that the contents of the Special Notice were defamatory, the matter is currently sub judice and Tata Sons strongly denies such allegations,"" the statement said.  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/nusli-wadia-defamation-case-court-issues-notice-to-ratan-tata-others-1976503.html
2018-05-30,"The CBI has alleged that Air Asia officials colluded with unknown government officials during the UPA rule and tried to lobby with civil servants later to have the 5/20 rule amended.   The 5/20 rule, which came into effect in 2004, stipulated that a carrier needs to be in operation for five years and possess 20 aircraft to become eligible to fly abroad. “Emails purportedly written by me have been circulated in the media in the context of the issue of 5/20 in the aviation sector. This has been a much debated policy matter and Air Asia India was one of the many airlines that had formally sought a review of this policy,” he said.  The first information report (FIR) filed by the CBI said that after lobbying by Air Asia officials, a Cabinet note was floated in February 2014 to amend the 5/20 rule. The policy decision could not be approved as the model code of conduct kicked in soon after when the dates for the Lok Sabha elections were announced, according to the FIR. The NDA government amended the rule in June 2016, removing the 5-year operation clause, though the CBI FIR does not make it clear whether it says the policy change was effected through corrupt practices. Apart from Fernandes and Venkataraman, the CBI FIR also names aviation consultant Deepak Talwar, Rajendra Dubey (director of Singapore-based HNR Trading), and unidentified public servants. It further talks about payments to the tune of Rs 12.28 crore that were remitted to India with an intention to bribe officials. The CBI also alleged that the Malaysia-based Air Asia group violated FIPB and FDI norms by giving effective management control to a foreign entity, and making Air Asia India Limited a de-facto subsidiary rather than a joint venture.

2018-01-13,"A winner here five times, a record that he shares with World Champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway, Anand went for complications right from the beginning when he allowed Matlakov to break through on the queen side in a closed Ruy Lopez.   The Russian managed to weaken whites king side and threatened a beautiful checkmate vide queen sacrifice at one point. Anand came out of that but not without an error that could have left him a pawn less. However, Matlakov missed his chance and then was subjected to a lesson in a major piece endgame. Anands queen and rook dominated the proceedings once the Indian won a pawn and though the technicalities remained, it was all over in 53 moves. ""I was not able to breakthroughs,"" said Anand in the post-game chat adding that it would have been a huge technical task to convert if his opponent had not blundered. When asked about his possible sixth title victory here Anand said, ""If I win now, I'm winning after 12 years, so it's not like I've been blazing but, well, I'll try for sure."" Grandmaster B Adhiban, the other Indian in the 14-player 13-round field, started off with a draw against Peter Svidler of Russia. In the last edition, Adhiban had caused a sensation here when he finished third ahead of many stalwarts.  Besides Anand, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia and local hero Anish Giri were the other winners in the opening round.  Kramnik grinded down Wei Yi of China while Giri scored against highest-ranked woman Yifan Hou of China. Carlsen was held to a draw by Fabiano Caruana of United States. It was a usually long game arising out of a Petroff defense that the world champion could not break. In the Challengers section, top seed Vidit Gujrathi was held to a draw by World Junior champion Aryan Tari of Norway.  It was a Ruy Lopez where Gujrathi played black and sacrificed his rook to force perpetual checks.

2018-02-18,"""One year on, the marathoner Chandra in his typical style seems to have met with some success in leading performance across businesses in a challenging environment. His first year in office has been marked by finding solutions to legacy issues like the Tata Teleservices-NTT Docomo dispute, revamping Tata Motor's domestic operations and also divesting Tata Steel's cash burning European operations,"" said a Bombay House insider.   One of his biggest achievements would be the now- almost-certain acquisition of the crippled Bhushan Steel by Tata Steel for Rs 36,000 crore, which the company has reportedly bid for and thus emerging as the highest bidder for the Delhi-based company that's under NCLT now. Chandra took over the reins last February, when the group was facing a litany of challenges and bad press for the manner in which the board sacked Mistry as the chairman after a four-year stint.  The case is sub-judice now with NCLTs and the Delhi and Bombay high courts hearing a slew of petitions. The issues ranged from loss-making units to aftermath of the acrimonious exit of Mistry, whose family is the single largest shareholder in Tata Sons with an 18.6 percent stake.  Chandra began with clear intent to resolve some of the issues that the group was plagued with during the Mistry era. Some of the most notable resolutions that he could sew up include the USD 1.2-billion settlement with the Japanese telecom major Docomo, and also the sale of its crippled telecom business to Bharti Airtel, the resolution of Tata Steel Europe's highly loss-making business with part sale and a merger with Thyssenkrupp of Germany. Another achievement is the approval to demerge the vast tracts of land parcels of Tata Communications which was previously known as the government-run VSNL. He also simplified the group holding structure, including to unwinding of cross-holdings towards which, according to the Bombay House insiders, has seen the group spending around Rs 10,000 crore towards share buybacks. This has seen Tata Steel buying back 1.6 percent stake Tata Motors held, Tata Global buying back 4.5 percent stake in Tata Chemicals, which in turn sold back its 6.9 percent in it. Tata Sons also increased their holdings in Tata Motors by 1.6 percent, also marginally in Tata Power and T Communication. To deleverage the crippled telecom business, the parent has pumped in a whopping Rs 20,000 into Tata Tele. ""These steps gave the world a clear indication that the Tata Group is serious about business and while they are ready to invest in core businesses for growth, they will also not hesitate to exit non-core businesses that would continue to burn cash,"" said an analyst. Another key area that Chandra focused was on getting fresh blood into the 15-year-old group. The new appointments at the Tata Sons level included Saurabh Agrawal coming in as the group CFO; Aarthi Subramanian as the group chief digital officer; Banmali Agrawala as the head of the newly created infra cluster; Shuva Mandal as the group general counsel; and Rupa Purushothaman of the Goldman fame as the group chief economist among others. At the companies level, key appoints include Puneet Chhatwal as the CEO of Indian Hotels, replacing Rakesh Sarna who was handpicked by Mistry; Rajiv Sabharwal as CEO of Tata Capital in place Brotin Banerjee; PB Balaji as the CFO of Tata Motors; Giridhar Sanjeevi as CFO at IHCL; and Prathit Bhobe as the CEO of Tata AMC. Chandra is also getting a new head for Tata Power, having ensured the company veteran Anil Sardana resigned. On the market valuation front, the group companies led by the cash-cow TCS, Tata Steel, Titan, Tata Global have Tata Chemicals outperformed the indices in the first year of Chandra as the chairman. Most of the key Tata stocks have outperformed the market, which is a clear a thumbs up to his leadership. While Tata Steel has rallied over 47 percent, Tata Global Beverages soared over 94 percent and TCS has crossed the Rs 6-trillion m-cap mount many times since last December, becoming the first domestic firm to do so till RIL too achieved it and since then it’s a tight fight between the two. ""The rally in Tata stocks is credible in the face of the Sensex growing only 18 percent during the same time and therefore is an endorsement of Chandra's leadership,"" said an analyst. But he was quick to note that there are also laggards like Tata Motors which fell a good 18 percent and Tata Power which barely moved up with a paltry 2 percent gain.  In the past one year, across the 22 listed Tata entities, the value of the stocks has grown by Rs 1,45,000 crore registering a growth of over 17.5 percent. ""The market seems to have liked Chandra's efforts in closing some of the legacy issues of Tata Steel including its cash guzzling international operations,"" said an analyst.  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/chandrasekarans-2nd-year-may-begin-with-tatas-largest-domestic-deal-with-bhushan-steel-takeover-1664729.html
2018-09-10,"""ArcelorMittal confirms that it has today submitted a revised proposal to Essar Steel's Committee of Creditors for the acquisition of ESIL,"" ArcelorMittal said in a statement Monday.   ""The financial terms of the proposal are confidential, but represent a material increase to the previous offers made by the company,"" it added. The revised offer, which includes a commitment to pay the entire amount due to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, therefore represents unprecedented value to all concerned creditors, the statement added.  ""Through the revised offer ArcelorMittal demonstrates its serious commitment to India, creditor banks and all ESIL's stakeholders,"" it said. Apart from ArcelorMittal, Russia's VTB Group-backed Numetal Ltd and mining baron Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta are in the race to acquire Essar Steel. The Resolution Professional, overseeing the auction of Essar Steel to recover over Rs 49,000 crore of unpaid loans had sent emails to all the three bidders to be present Monday for the opening of the second round of bids. This followed a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) judgement last week on the eligibility of bids. It had ruled that Numetal's Rs 37,000-crore second-round bid for Essar Steel is valid, but asked rival bidder ArcelorMittal to clear Rs 7,000 crore dues of its previously associated firms within three days to qualify for the acquisition. A two-member bench of NCLAT headed by its Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya in a 68-page order had asked lenders, who are auctioning Essar Steel to recover over Rs 49,000 crore of unpaid loans, to consider the second round bid of Numetal and mining baron Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta. ArcelorMittal's bid will be considered if it pays dues by September 11. For ArcelorMittal India (AMI), which was the only other bidder besides Numetal in the first round, the NCLAT held that it needs to remove the ""stigma of defaulter"" attached to it because of its previous 29 per cent stake in Uttam Galva Steel and KSS Petron. The NCLAT held that the first round of bid by Russia's VTB Group-backed Numetal in February was ineligible as the firm was 25 per cent owned by Rewant Ruia, scion of Essar Steel's promoter Ruia family. But, he exited the firm before the second round of bid was submitted in March, making Numetal eligible. Numetal and steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal had in February submitted separate bids to take over Essar Steel. The Committee of Creditors (CoC), however, disqualified both bids saying their promoters were tied to companies, which were bank loan defaulters and so ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The second round of bids was called where JSW Steel joined Numetal to put in a bid of Rs 37,000 crore, while Vedanta Ltd entered the fray as a third bidder. AMI too put in a bid. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/arcelormittal-ups-bid-for-debt-laden-essar-steel-in-second-round-1873545.html

2018-09-28,"The lease for the hotel will be granted to the group for 33 years at double the license fees.    ""The Tata group's Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) has retained the property at a license fees of Rs 7.03 crore per month including GST or 32.50 per cent of the gross turnover of the property. Earlier, they were paying Rs 3.94 crore per month as license fees,"" a senior NDMC official told PTI. Failing to auction the luxury hotel in two attempts, the NDMC had last month decided to relax the eligibility criteria for bidders and reduce the minimum number of bids required. The auction had to be put off twice as it got less than the required number of bids for the five-star property to go under the hammer. Earlier, the civic body had issued an annulment notice for the e-auction in June when it had to be cancelled as only IHCL -- the existing operator -- had submitted its bid for retaining the property. The Taj Mansingh was given to the Tata group in 1978 on a lease for 33 years, which ended in 2011. The company was since given nine temporary extensions. However, the civic body could not auction the property then as it was tied up in a legal battle with the IHCL.

2018-07-16,"""Given this large contribution, weakening credit metrics at JLR have a direct and immediate impact on TML's consolidated results,"" it added. Moody's said that TML's consolidated adjusted debt/EBITDA is likely to remain elevated over the 12-18 months.    At the same time, large capital and product development expenditure at JLR of GBP4.5 billion annually will keep free cash flows negative, it added. ""Moreover, Moody's also expects that rising commodity prices and a challenging operating environment for JLR will keep TML's EBITDA margins below 3 per cent,"" the rating agency said.

2018-09-16,"Once the heart of the furnace, which is normally more than 1,200 degrees Celsius, has cooled, skilled engineers will begin work to replace parts of the heat resistant interior and vital structural parts, it said.   The project, costing tens of millions of pounds and expected to take several months, will also see the waste gas and dust extraction system being replaced. Alan Coombs, Chair of the Port Talbot multi-union committee, said: ""This investment in Port Talbot is a huge vote of confidence in the workforce, and follows some other major investments which will help sustain the steel industry in the UK."" Tata Steel said Blast Furnace 5 life extension project is a critical part of the company's long-term strategy to strengthen its operations in the UK and will underpin improvements throughout its UK supply chain. Confirmation of the investment came at the same time as the announcement in June of definitive agreements being signed by Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel to form a joint venture of their European steel businesses. On Friday, project engineers began what is known as a salamander tap of the furnace. This involves a number of holes being drilled through the base of the furnace to fully drain it of liquid iron. The operation is carried out remotely and it is expected it could take more than a day to remove all the remaining iron, the company said. Tata Steel is one of Europe's leading steel producers, with steelmaking in the Netherlands and the UK, and manufacturing plants across Europe. The company supplies high-quality steel products to the most demanding markets, including construction and infrastructure, automotive, packaging and engineering. In June, it had announced a historic 50-50 joint venture with German steel giant Thyssenkrupp, creating Europe's second-largest steelworks after NRI steel magnate Lakshmi N Mittal-led ArcelorMittal. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/tata-steel-begins-work-on-blast-furnace-at-uk-plant-1879333.html
2018-10-22,"The effect of impairment was reflected on Tata Sons' consolidated net profit which dropped to Rs 4,379 crore at the end of 2017-18 from Rs 18,432 crore in 2016-17.   On a standalone basis, the net profit of Tata Sons increased by 6 per cent to Rs 873 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 824 crore in 2016-17. According to the filing, Tata Teleservices recorded an impairment loss of Rs 16,891.28 crore, including Rs 1,265.81 crore pertaining to the prior period, on the consumer mobile business assets based on an assessment of its recoverable value. Tata Sons has also made a provision for claims of Rs 4,393.45 crore for the year ended March 31, 2018, after considering various factors "" including the without prejudice discussions with the relevant counterparties"". The filing said that a subsidiary company had evaluated the recoverable value of spectrum that Tata Teleservices acquires in March 2015 and recorded an impairment loss of Rs 905.41 crore around the same. Taking the factors at Tata Teleservices into account, Tata Sons said that ""the company considered inappropriate to write off the entire investment of Rs 28,651.69 crore in the subsidiary company in its standalone financial statements."" Tata Teleservices suffered a jolt after its three licences were cancelled by the Supreme Court in 2012 for irregularities in spectrum allocation to the company and several other new entrants. Following the development, Tata Teleservices ran into a tussle with its partner NTT Docomo which decided to withdraw its investment in the telecom firm. Tata Teleservices became subsidiary of Tata Sons from an associate firm with effect from February 2017 after its arrangement with NTT Docomo ceased. The heavy tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio in 2016 led to Tata Sons signing a pact with Bharti Airtel to hive off consumer mobile business of Tata Teleservices without any debt transfer to the Sunil Bharti Mittal-led firm.  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/tata-sons-writes-off-entire-rs-28651-crore-investment-in-tata-teleservices-1916595.html
2018-01-06,"Jamshedpur, coached by former Man City boss Steve Coppell, had Sunil Bhaskaran, a vice president at Tata Steel and chairman of the Tata Football Academy, give Soriano a full tour of the stadium.   “This is spectacular. Atmosphere is great and we saw some very good football. I am very impressed,"" Soriano said.  Soriano said recently that he expects football to become the biggest sport in all countries all over the world, including the cricket crazy India and the United States.  “I think this is a land of opportunity. There is enough evidence that India has talent and they can be coached to get to the top. For Indian talent to grow, coaching is very important. You need good coaches to come to India who can also coach other coaches here,” he said. Soriano also impressed upon the fact that CFG want to create a strong foothold all over the world in a bid to maximise commercial avenues and develop football. A plan like that is likely to involve more than one club per continent. “We think India is a major opportunity for football because there is talent and passion and we are very positive about the development of football in the country. That’s why we are here. We want to watch some ISL games, meet people and want to see players,” Soriano added. The City Football Group added Girona in Spain as the sixth club after Man City, Major League Soccer franchise New York City FC, Australian A-League outfit Melbourne City FC, Japan’s Yokohama F. Marinos and Club Atletico Torque in Uruguay to join the CFG stable in a £3.1 million takeover last year.

2018-11-14,"Buying Jet, with its fleet of 124 aircraft, would return Tata to the forefront of Indian aviation in terms of size, almost 70 years after its first airline was nationalised, and six years after it re-entered the market with two joint ventures.   However, Tata will also take on an airline which reported its third consecutive quarterly loss on Monday and owes money to vendors and employees alike. With liabilities exceeding assets, Jet's accountants prepared its financial results on a ""going concern basis"" assuming the airline receives a capital injection. ""If Tata is into aviation then they are in it completely or it does not make sense,"" said an industry executive, who declined to be identified as the deal was not yet final. ""Combining Jet with its own airline will give Tata the scale and size it typically operates at in its other businesses."" Tata's businesses are as varied as IT services and car-making. In aviation, it runs the Vistara full-service carrier together with Singapore Airlines Ltd, which applied to begin international flights earlier this year. Tata would likely seek to combine Vistara with Jet, three of the people said, thereby achieving international expansion in a fraction of the time it would take organically. ""If you have to make sure that Vistara is given a leg up, this acquisition is perfectly in line,"" the industry executive said. ""It will move the airline from one extreme to another.""Singapore Airlines' Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on Wednesday told reporters he would not comment on ""speculation"".  Market Growth India's airlines are increasingly looking abroad in search of better returns as price competition intensifies domestically, while a weaker rupee and rising fuel costs have wrought havoc on the finances of carriers such as Jet. Nevertheless, India's aviation market is likely to clock an annual passenger growth rate of 10 to 12 per cent this year on international flights and 18 to 20 per cent domestically, showed forecasts from aviation consultant CAPA. ""Despite the challenges faced by the aviation sector, the wider macro-economic conditions remain strong,"" CAPA said in a client note. ""With airlines offering low fares, demand for travel will be stimulated."" As well as Vistara, Tata operates low-cost domestic carrier AirAsia India along with AirAsia Group Bhd. Group company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd also handles the back-end operations for carriers including Singapore Airlines, British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Should a deal with Jet succeed, Tata would gain access to hard-to-get parking slots at Mumbai's congested airport, most of which are occupied by the 25-year-old airline. However, Tata would also inherit a company struggling to make any money, and whose survival is crucial for the host of lessors from which it leases over 100 of its aeroplanes.

2018-10-04,"""Acceding to this request (of CoC), in order to do complete justice under Article 142 of the Constitution..., we give one more opportunity to both resolution applicants to pay off the NPAs of their related corporate debtors within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of this judgment, in accordance with the proviso to Section 29A(c),"" said the bench in its 154-page verdict.   ""If such payments are made within the aforesaid period, both resolution applicants can resubmit their resolution plans dated April 2, 2018 to the CoC, who are then given a period of 8 weeks from this date, to accept, by the requisite majority, the best amongst the plans submitted, including the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta,"" it said. It also said that in the event where no plan is found ""worthy of acceptance"" by the requisite majority of the CoC, corporate debtor Essar Steel, shall ""go into liquidation"". The bench dealt in detail with Section 29A (c) of the IBC which provides as to who are the persons ineligible to bid for a corporate debtor. It said: ""The interpretation of Section 29A(c) now becomes clear. Any person who wishes to submit a resolution plan, if he or it does so acting jointly, or in concert with other persons, which person or other persons happen to either manage or control or be promoters of a corporate debtor, who is classified as a NPA and whose debts have not been paid off for a period of at least one year before commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process, becomes ineligible to submit a resolution plan."" It further said that the provision ensured that ""the ineligibility can only be removed if the person submitting a resolution plan makes payment of all overdue amounts with interest thereon and charges relating to the NPAs in question before submission of a resolution plan."" The bench added that the position in law is clear that such person ""must first pay off the debt of the said corporate debtor classified as NPAs in order to become eligible under Section 29A(c)"". It held IBC ""lifts the corporate veil"" to ascertain whether a firm has been formed to evade obligations imposed by law and this principle is applied even to group firms so that one is able to look at economic entity of the group as a whole. As per the verdict, ArcelorMittal will qualify to bid for Essar Steel only if it clears the Rs 7,000 crore dues of two firms, Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, it was previously associated with. With regard to NuMetal, it has not specified NPAs of its related corporate debtors which have to be paid off to become eligible to bid for corporate debtors Essar Steel. The bench examined the resolution plan of NuMetal and said it was incorporated in Mauritius on October 13, 2017, ""expressly for the purpose"" of bidding for Essar Steel. It said Aurora Holdings Ltd (AHL) and Aurora Enterprises Ltd (AEL) were also incorporated on the same day by Rewant Ruia, son of Ravi Ruia, who was the promoter of Essar Steel. It also noted that the ""entire share capital of AHL, which in turn held the entire shareholding of AEL, which in turn held the entire share capital of Numetal"". ""At this stage there can be no doubt whatsoever that Rewant Ruia, being the son of Ravi Ruia, would be deemed to be a person acting in concert with the corporate debtor, being covered by Regulation 2(1)(q)(v) of the 2011 Takeover Regulations,"" it said. The bench, however, did not agree to the submission that the Russian bank VTB was barred from bidding for a company in India on account of sanctions imposed by authorities in USA and the European Union. ""What will be noticed is that the sanctions that have been imposed by the authorities of both USA and the Council of EU are not on account of any misconduct on the part of VTB Bank. Rather, they have been imposed politically, because of the conduct of a particular country, i.e. Russia, which has sought to undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty...,"" it noted. Dealing with ineligibility of ArcelorMittal, it said it was absolutely clear that L N Mittal is ""ultimate shareholder"" of ArcelorMittal India Limited and one of the group firms was ""a promoter of Uttam Galva"" whose assets have been declared as NPAs. ""The reasonably proximate facts prior to the submission of both resolution plans by AMIPL would show that there is no doubt whatsoever that AMNLBV's shares in Uttam Galva were sold only in order to get out of the ineligibility mentioned by Section 29A(c)...,"" it said. It also said there was no doubt that ArcelorMittal had a considerable stake in KSS Petron which had also been declared NPA. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/supreme-court-allows-arcelormittal-numetal-to-bid-for-essar-steel-1898497.html

2018-08-23,"A two-member bench headed by its Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya admitted Mistry's appeal and directed Tata Sons and other respondents to file their reply within 10 days.   NCLAT has listed the matter on September 24 for next hearing. On August 14, NCLAT had reserved order over the interim relief sought by Cyrus Mistry camp. Mistry had challenged the orders of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which had dismissed his plea challenging his removal as chairman of the company. In September last year, Tata Sons had received shareholders' nod to convert itself into a private limited company from being a public limited company, limiting in effect Cyrus Mistry family's ability to sell their stake to outsiders. A public limited company allows shareholders to legally sell their stake to anyone, but a shareholder of a private limited firm cannot sell the shares to external investors. The Mistry camp had challenged the July 9 order of the Mumbai bench of the NCLT which dismissed their pleas against his removal as Tata Sons chairman, as also the allegations of rampant misconduct on part of Ratan Tata and the company's Board. A special bench of the tribunal had held that the board of directors at Tata Sons was ""competent"" to remove the executive chairperson of the company. NCLT bench members B S V Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy had also said that Mistry was ousted as chairman because the Tata Sons' Board and its majority shareholders had ""lost confidence in him"". Under the Companies Act 2013, an order of NCLT can be challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Mistry, who was the sixth chairman of Tata Sons, was ousted from the position in October 2016. He had taken over as the chairman in 2012 after Ratan Tata announced his retirement. Two months after his removal, Mistry's family-run firms Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd and Sterling Investments Corp approached the NCLT as minority shareholders, against Tata Sons, Ratan Tata, and some other board members. Mistry in his pleas primarily argued that his removal was not in accordance with the Companies Act and that there was rampant mismanagement of affairs across Tata Sons. He also alleged that Tata Trust chairperson Ratan Tata and trustee N Soonawala interfered with the day-to-day operations of the group companies, they acted as shadow directors, and all of the above caused massive revenue loss for the group.  .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/nclat-says-tata-sons-cannot-force-cyrus-mistry-to-sell-his-shares-in-company-till-appeal-is-pending-1855281.html
2018-07-05,"A joint understanding of Board and Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company, he said.   He added: ""The joint venture of our steel activities with Tata is the next significant step to turn Thyssenkrupp into a strong industrial company. We can be proud of what we achieved until now. For this I would like to thank all employees. They are the most valuable capital of Thyssenkrupp. Tata Steel's 50-50 joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp has created Europe's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal. The JV combines the European steel businesses of the Indian steel major with the German firm to create Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV. The new steel company will have a total workforce of 48,000 employees spread across 34 sites. Prof Ulrich Lehner, chairman of the supervisory board, praised the outgoing CEO and said that the Board, under the leadership of Hiesinger, has freed Thyssenkrupp from an existential crisis and made the company ready for the future by implementing the strategy which was agreed by the Supervisory Board. Without Heinrich Hiesinger there would be no Thyssenkrupp today. I am deeply grateful for what he achieved and especially for how he achieved this: intelligent, modest, consistent; with far-sightedness and social responsibility and always in the interest of our customers, employees and shareholders, he said.

2018-05-23,"It has now cleared all the regulatory hurdles needed to proceed with the acquisition after India's National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved TSL's debt resolution plan for BSL on May 15, 2018, it said.   BSL, which has steelmaking capacity of around 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), was one of five key distressed steel assets put up for bidding under insolvency proceedings in India. ""Under the resolution plan, Bhushan's financial creditors will receive Rs 352 billion for settlement of existing financial debt. This amount will be financed with new secured debt of Rs 165 billion and cash on TSL's balance sheet. TSL will subsequently acquire a 72.65 percent equity stake in Bhushan (Steel),"" Fitch said. TSL's projected steelmaking capacity will increase to 23mtpa with the Bhushan acquisition and including TSL's own 5mtpa capacity expansion scheduled to be completed in 2022, it said. This is in line with management's intention of doubling capacity in India from 13 MTPA in the next five years. Bhushan's main plant is relatively close, about 150 km away from TSL's Kalinganagar plant in Odisha in eastern India. Bhushan's plant is underutilised, producing around 3.5mtpa currently. TSL believes its turnaround plan will enable the plant to reach close to 100 percent utilisation in two years, it added. Bhushan's plant, unlike TSL's, does not benefit from use of captive raw materials currently. However, TSL envisages gains from improvement in operating metrics and from unified marketing and procurement. Bhushan's product mix is enhanced by downstream facilities like its cold-rolling mill and galvanizing units. TSL also has the option to increase capacity at Bhushan's site in the future, which is useful given the significant time required to set up a green field plant in India. The BSL acquisition will enable TSL to improve its domestic market share, but Fitch estimates it will raise TSL's leverage, in terms of net debt to EBITDA, to 4x over the next two to three years from around 3x at end-March 2018. It said TSL's net debt will increase by around Rs 35,000 crore due to the acquisition, excluding additional working capital debt at Bhushan. ""We assume additional EBITDA of around INR45 billion in the second year following the acquisition, based on an output of 5 million tonnes and an EBITDA per tonne of around Rs 9,000, based on TSL successfully improving operations at Bhushan to near-optimum levels within two years,"" the Fitch statement said. TSL has also shown interest in acquiring a controlling stake in another steel asset - Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. The result of that bidding process is likely to be known within the next few months. A successful bid is likely to further increase TSL's leverage over the medium term, Fitch added. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/bhushan-acquisition-likely-to-raise-tata-steels-leverage-fitch-1758025.html

2018-05-31,"Venkatarman had on Wednesday alleged that the ""present accusations qua Air Asia India find their root in baseless allegations made by Cyrus P Mistry and the Shapoor Pallonji Group against Tata Trusts Trustees (me included) and Tata Sons in his 'revenge' legal actions.""    The CBI has registered a case against Air Asia Group CEO Tony Fernandes, Venkataramanan and other officials for allegedly trying to manipulate government policies through corrupt means to get international licence. ""It is well documented that Mr R Venkataraman was intimately involved in the affairs of Air Asia India right from its inception. He has had many roles including that of Executive Assistant to Mr Ratan Tata at the time of the formation of the company (AirAsia India), Tata Sons' nominee on the board, as well as that of a shareholder with a 1.5 per cent stake in the company,"" Mistry said in a statement. The budget carrier is majority-owned by Tatas and Venkataramanan has around 1.5 per cent shareholding in the joint venture with Air Asia Berhad.  ""Therefore, his weak excuse that he was only a non-executive director without any responsibility is totally without any merit...The Board of Tata Sons and the Tata Trustees need to concern themselves over the decline in governance standards at Air Asia India that this shameful case reveals,"" Mistry added in the statement.  The Tata Brand has always stood for the highest levels of ethics and governance, the former chairman said, adding, ""It is therefore deeply disturbing that a few individuals with alleged questionable motives are today bringing disrepute to the Tata Brand."" ""In my capacity as non-executive director of AirAsia India Limited, I have been wrongly named as an accused by the CBI on operational matters where I had little or no role to play,"" Venkatraman had said. ""R Venkataraman, as the Managing Trustee of the Tata Trusts, should know better than to drag the name of such a remarkable institution into an investigation by the CBI over his alleged personal integrity and alleged corrupt business dealings,"" Mistry said in the statement.  ""This ridiculous attempt to question the independence of the CBI and to cloak his alleged misadventures by using my name is treated with the contempt it deserves,"" he said.  His alleged actions, which are under investigation, raise grave public concerns over his (Venkataraman's) credibility and ability to be the custodian of India's largest public charitable trust.

2018-11-28,"The report said that their attorney Daniel Kotchen presented data showing that the company has fired fewer than one per cent of its South Asian employees, who are mostly Indian, in the US, compared with 10.6 per cent of its non-South Asian employees.The suit also alleged that the TCS let go of 78 per cent of its non-South Asian workers who were taken off job assignments, or ""benched"" from work, between 2011 and 2014, while only 22 per cent of benched South Asians were fired, even though they made up half of the company's US workforce. The TCS executives testified at trial that the company had recently raised its year-over-year retention rate to 82 per cent from 69 per cent and that the company had increased the number of US residents it hires and retains, the law360.com report said. It added that in closing arguments, Tata's counsel Terry Garnett of Loeb & Loeb LLP, argued that the company's employment data show there's been a 400 per cent increase in local hires since 2011.  Garnett also said at trial that most of the workers who alleged they had been fired were let go for refusing to relocate for a job. A report in the East Bay Times quoted Garnett as saying that the nine-member jury unanimously ruled that TCS ""did not discriminate on the base of race or national origin."" The report cited a Tata representative as saying that they have always believed the claims in the case were baseless and are gratified that the jury agreed. The verdict came as the Trump administration is doubling down on immigration and its tough stance is impacting companies from hiring and retaining foreign workers on the H1B work visas, which is the most-sought after among Indian IT professionals. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/us-jury-rules-in-favour-of-tcs-accused-of-favouring-indians-1954173.html
2018-10-19,"The company said it will now enter into further final negotiations with the CoC.     Essar Steel was among the 12 companies referred by the RBI for Insolvency proceedings. ArcelorMittal, earlier this week has said it will pay Rs 7,469 crore to the creditors of Uttam Galva and KKS Petron to be eligible to acquire the debt-laden firm, as per Supreme Court order. The Supreme Court on October 4 had granted one more opportunity to the world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and Russia's VTB Capital-backed NuMetal to bid for Essar Steel if they clear their non-performing asset (NPA) dues of their related corporate debtors within two weeks. ""ArcelorMittal announces that, in-line with the Indian Supreme Court ruling dated 4 October 2018, it has approved a payment of 7,469 crore rupees (approx USD 1 billion) to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron to clear overdue debts in order that the offer it submitted for Essar Steel India Limited (ESIL) on 2 April 2018 is eligible and can be considered by ESIL's Committee of Creditors (CoC),"" the Luxembourg-headquartered company has said. Of the Rs 7,469 crore payment, around 80 per cent will be used to settle the dues of Uttam Galva and the rest 20 per cent for KSS Petron, the company said. ArcelorMittal has said its board of directors believes that ""ESIL represents a unique and compelling opportunity for the Company to establish a significant footprint"", with substantial expansion potential, in the high-growth Indian steel market. Russia's VTB Bank on October 12 had moved the Supreme Court seeking clarification of its October 4 verdict by which mining major ArcelorMittal and NuMetal were granted another opportunity to bid for Essar Steel. VTB Bank has recently indicated that it was likely to bid alone for the debt-ridden Essar Steel. A bench of justices R F Nariman and Indu Malhotra had said that ArcelorMittal and VTB Bank-promoted NuMetal can bid for Essar Steel, provided the two pay off the non-performing assets (NPAs) of their related corporate debtors within two weeks from October 4. It, however, had held that ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd and NuMetal Ltd were ineligible to file resolution plans for corporate debtor Essar Steel -- which had NPAs or bad debts amounting to Rs 45,000 crore -- as per the criteria laid down in the amended Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). As per the verdict, ArcelorMittal will qualify to bid for Essar Steel only if it clears about Rs 7,000 crore dues of two firms, Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, it was previously associated with. With regard to NuMetal, the court had held that it was a shell company of Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia and can only become eligible after of the NPAs of the group firms. The court, however, had not specified NPAs of NuMetal's related corporate debtors which have to be paid off to become eligible to bid for corporate debtors Essar Steel. Earlier, both the firms had moved the apex court against the decision of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal which had ruled that NuMetal's second bid for Essar Steel was eligible, but the same by ArcelorMittal would qualify only if it cleared the Rs 7,000 crore dues of two firms it was previously associated with. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/arcelormittal-emerges-as-highest-bidder-for-essar-steel-1914443.html

However, there was no duty hike on motorcycles imported from the US. Last week, India had submitted to the WTO a revised list of 30 items on which it proposed to raise customs duties by up to 50 per cent. The move was in retaliation to the duty hike by the US on certain steel and aluminium products which had tariff implication of USD 241 million on India. The duty hike by India would have an equivalent tariff implications for the US. Sources said out of 30 items proposed, India has ""excluded motorbikes above 800 cc. Now additional customs duties have been imposed on 29 items.""  On March 9, US President Donald Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items, a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war. India has said the duty imposed by the US has affected steel exports by USD 198.6 million and aluminium shipments by USD 42.4 million. India has also dragged the US to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism over the imposition of import duties on steel and aluminium. India exports steel and aluminium products worth about USD 1.5 billion to the US every year.

2018-11-05,"TCS denies any unlawful bias in its US operations and says in court filings that the Caucasian American leading the lawsuit was removed from one of its projects and ultimately terminated over “performance concerns”. TCS told Bloomberg it can’t comment specifically on the pending litigation, but believes it has a strong case and will prevail at trial.   “Our success is based on our ability to provide the best talent available, both in the US and globally, based purely on the individual’s specialized experience, skills and fit for each client’s specific needs,” the report quoted a company spokesperson. “TCS also strictly adheres to all federal and state equal employment opportunity laws and regulations.” The jury is expected to be shown statistical evidence that the odds of race and national origin not being a factor in TCS’s termination decisions are less than one in a billion. That’s because, since 2011, the company fired 12.6 percent of its non-South Asian workers in the US, compared with less than 1 percent of its South Asian employees, according to the complaint. While TCS has won awards as a top employer in North America, the lawsuit paints a different picture. The case was brought as a class action on behalf of about 1,000 non-South Asians — most of them US citizens — who were fired by TCS while on “benched” status, meaning they were laid off by the company while they were between job assignments. The plaintiffs allege TCS has engaged in a “systematic pattern and practice of discrimination” by favoring Indian ex-pats and visa-ready workers from India for US positions. That has resulted in a workforce that’s almost 80 percent South Asian, far greater than the 12 percent representation of South Asians in the US IT workforce, according to the complaint. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/tcs-faces-us-jury-over-firing-of-american-employees-report-1930279.html
