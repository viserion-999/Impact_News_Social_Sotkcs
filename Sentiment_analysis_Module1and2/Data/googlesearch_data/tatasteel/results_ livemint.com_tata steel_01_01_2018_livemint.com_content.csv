2018-03-11,"US President Donald Trump was true to his word and has imposed a 25% import tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium, with effect from 23 March. The only concession the President has made is to exclude Mexico and Canada from these tariffs, subject to continuation of trade talks and with the expectation that they will prevent transhipment through their territory to the US.The US government hopes to revive plants that may have been idled or shut, to increase the share of domestic production and create jobs. The objective is that 80% of existing domestic capacity will be put to use, due to these tariffs. The report that the government used to base this decision says capacity utilization in steel was estimated at 72% in 2017 and for aluminium at 39%.The presidential proclamation goes on to invite any country that believes it deserves an exemption to make a case for one. Even with Mexico and Canada, the government wants to limit imports. The European Union and UK are already calling for an exemption though no formal talks have been held. Rather than collectively take action to compel the US to remove these tariffs, countries or regional blocs are asking for an exemption for themselves. On Friday, a tweet from Trump indicated a deal with Australia was on the cards.That these tariffs have been approved leads to an uncertain period ahead for India’s steel and aluminium producers. While there is a risk of retaliatory tariffs, there is also a risk of excess metal in the market, if exports to the US become unviable. Consequently, metal stocks had a terrible time on the domestic stock market last week.Among companies, Tata Steel Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd have significant operations overseas. Tata Steel’s European steel operations are likely to feel the heat. Even when the European business moves into a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG, the main region of operation will remain Europe. Any significant downturn in steel demand or prices is a risk to be watched for. For steel, a bigger concern could be that prices of iron ore have declined in China last week on concerns that imports fell in February.Hindalco’s subsidiary Novelis Inc. buys aluminium metal or scrap, which it then processes into rolled products to be used to make products such as beverage cans or products used in the automobile industry. Since Canada’s steel and aluminium industry is exempted, the impact on Novelis is likely to be less than expected. When the company’s March quarter results are announced, investors will wait to hear management commentary on what impact the tariffs are having on its business.In sum, Trump’s tariffs are here to stay and how other countries react to these tariffs will be a factor that will determine how prices behave. Company-specific impact should become clear post-March quarter results. The bigger risk is industry-wide effects if other countries retaliate with their own tariffs, which then affects exports or results in a decline in prices.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/OjkIOg3Hi8sGMvXXiEr0rK/US-tariffs-Steel-set-for-a-bumpy-ride.html
2018-10-31,"Mumbai: The European Commission’s (EC’s) investigation into a proposed joint venture (JV) between Tata Steel Ltd and Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG may delay their plan to combine their European steel businesses, analysts say. The EC on Tuesday opened a deeper probe into the proposed joint venture over concerns that it may raise prices and hurt competition. “While there could be a delay due to the probe by the European Commission, we feel that there is currently no risk of the joint venture falling through. The probe is generally expected in such big mergers in Europe. It was a similar scenario in the case of ArcelorMittal where it was trying to acquire ILVA, an Italian steelmaker and a remedy was worked out,"" said Abhisar Jain, metals and mining analyst at Centrum Broking Ltd.On 30 June, Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp agreed to combine their steel businesses in an equal JV called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel.The proposed venture is subject to merger control clearance in several jurisdictions, including the European Union. Until the completion of the JV process, Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe and Tata Steel in Europe will operate as separate companies and as competitors.ALSO READ | EU probe may delay Tata Steel-Thyssenkrupp merger deal“On 30 October, in line with the expected timelines of the merger review process, the EC announced that it will undertake a Phase II review of the merger proposal and will investigate certain areas of preliminary competition concern. Tata Steel has noted the EC’s concerns and will continue its discussions with the EC including providing further information and analysis, especially in relation to sectors they have identified, to secure approval for the proposed joint venture,"" Tata Steel said in an exchange filing on Wednesday. The company added that it envisions the business combination as a structurally robust, sustainable and competitive company, which will be a reliable, efficient and technologically strong partner for its customers. “We also remain committed to continued constructive engagement with the EC in the following months as part of the next phase of this review process,"" Tata Steel added. So far, there are three segments where EC has shown concern—automotive steel, electrical steel and packaging steel. ArcelorMittal has double the market share in automotive steel as compared to what this JV may have so the parties can argue for a relaxation. The Tata Steel group is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 27 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) as on 31 March. It is the world’s second-most geographically diversified steel producer, with operations in 26 countries and a commercial presence in over 50 countries. The company said that over the last few months, Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp have engaged in parallel with EC to provide information in relation to the businesses which would be part of this joint venture. Following pre-notification engagement with the EC, both parties notified the proposed JV to the EC on 25 September. Jain at Centrum Broking said Tata Steel is looking to divest the electrical steel business. “On the packaging steel business, Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp can work out an alternative which may include a potential divestment,"" he said. Tata Steel said, however, that along with Thyssenkrupp, it continues to believe in the strong industrial logic and rationale for the proposed JV, and regards it as the optimal outcome for the future of its European steel business as well as for wider stakeholders in the European steel industry.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/3781oFECm559ivDDzoOFrI/EU-opens-probe-into-Tata-Steel-Thyssenkrupp-deal.html

The deal is expected to be completed in 6-9 months, it added.Tata Steel, in a release, said it has executed definitive agreements for the acquisition of Usha Martin’s steel business through a slump sale on a going concern basis. “It is proposed that the steel business of Usha Martin Ltd will be acquired subject to transaction closing, for a cash consideration of between  ₹ 4,300 and  ₹ 4,700 crore (subject to various transaction adjustments),"" the release said.The closing of the acquisition is subject to fulfilment of various conditions under the agreements. Usha Martin’s steel business comprises the specialised 1 million-tonnes-per-annum (MTPA) alloy based manufacturing capacity in the long products segment based in Jamshedpur, a producing iron-ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.The transaction and acquisition structure would be determined shortly, Tata Steel added.Tata Steel had an annual capacity of 27.5 MTPA as on March 31, 2018.

2018-08-13,"Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd’s consolidated first quarter net profit more than doubled to  ₹ 1,934 crore from  ₹ 921 crore in the corresponding period of last year. The growth in earnings was backed by burgeoning sales growth in the automotive and industrial sectors, and better operational efficiencies. India’s largest private-sector steel producer also witnessed an year-on-year (YoY) increase of 13.8% in revenues to  ₹ 16,405 crore, while EBITDA for the quarter jumped by 75.2% to  ₹ 5,118 crore. “The performance in this quarter has been very strong and Tata Steel India delivered a stand out performance of 31% EBITDA margin on the back of strong underlying business performance and improved market conditions,"" said Tata Steel executive director and chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee.“This reflected in the financial results of the company with Tata Steel India EBITDA at  ₹ 5,118 crore, implying an EBITDA per tonne of  ₹ 17,252 and quarterly EBIDTA of Tata Steel Europe at  ₹ 1,666 crore registering an EBITDA per tonne of  ₹ 6,801. Our quarterly consolidated EBITDA grew 33% YoY and increased to  ₹ 6,559 crore, with an EBITDA margin of 17%,"" he said. On 18 May, Tata Steel had acquired Bhushan Steel Ltd under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The process of consolidation of accounts is complete, said Tata Steel chief executive officer and managing director T.V. Narendran. The synergies between the two companies have started with extra slabs from the Bhushan Steel plant going into Tata Steel, while the former benefits from the coal procurement and product shipping lines within Tata Steel. Tata Steel has also thrown its hat in the ring for the stressed assets of Bhushan Power and Steel, which will witness another round of bid revisions. “For us Kalinganagar is very important, Bhushan Steel integration is very important. But we can’t break our head over this (revision of bids). How many times will we go in the fire? The first time we were declared the highest bidder, then someone comes along and we have to go through these rounds,"" said Chatterjee.“The process has changed, we haven’t changed our position. This is not a battlefield, it’s an acquisition. We will continue to grow but we will acquire at a cost that is fair,"" he said. Regarding Tata Steel’s joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, Narendran said: “We are working on seeking all relevant approvals for our 50:50 JV with Thyssenkrupp for our European business and look forward to a strong and sustainable business.""",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/KdtTGjaa00hqkEroLzct6K/Tata-Steel-Q1-profit-more-than-doubles-lags-forecasts.html
2018-07-02,"Mumbai: Despite its apparent concessions, has Tata Steel actually come out on top in the joint venture agreement with German competitor Thyssenkrupp? Analysts believe that ultimately, Tata Steel’s concessions have been “modest"" and far below what the more vocal of Thyssenkrupp’s investors have been gunning for.Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies said in an analysis of the deal that the 5% lower economic interest that Tata Steel has agreed to at the time of a future IPO “implies $200-350 million of value shift in favour of Thyssenkrupp"" against the original 50:50 agreement on sharing IPO proceeds. This offsets only part of the total value shift in favour of Tata Steel that Jefferies had earlier estimated of $500-600 million.In fact, US-based activist investor Elliott Advisors has accused Thyssenkrupp’s management of offloading assets into the joint venture too cheaply. Elliott had submitted an estimate of the two companies’ fair valuations, demanding an 80% stake in the joint venture for Thyssenkrupp for its more profitable operations. Financial Times reported on 1 July that two members of the Thyssenkrupp board voted against the deal while one member abstained. The newspaper also reported that Swedish activist investor Cevian Capital had voiced concerns regarding the deal’s valuations.In a conference with journalists in Brussels on Monday, Heinrich Hiesinger, CEO, Thyssenkrupp, insisted that his company had received a fair valuation. “We believe that the 55:45 split in IPO proceeds and the synergies (that will accrue) from the joint venture are a fair representation of our valuation and will address concerns that were raised about the valuation gap.""Thyssenkrupp’s management has also been under pressure to present a strategy update to the board of “life after steel"" and to improve margins in its capital goods and elevator business – its new stated areas of focus – and disposal plans for its industrial solutions and material sciences verticals. Managements at both firms have said that Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV – the new company and a 50:50 joint venture between the groups—is expected to have €17 billion in sales and joint labour force of 48,000 workers. It will be the second largest steel player in Europe in the flat steel market after ArcelorMittal. Both companies have stated that the JV will help achieve annual synergies of 400-500 million euros, through joint purchasing including logistics services, higher equipment utilization and reduced administrative expense. If, in the future, Thyssenkrupp decides to take the JV public, the proceeds will be split 55:45 in the German partner’s favour. Speaking to Mint a few days earlier, Atanu Mukherjee, president of global metals and energy consultant MN Dastur & Co., said: “I think it’s a great move for Tata Steel in terms of improving its position after its acquisition of Corus in 2007. With this, assets are pooled in a way that maximises value for Tata Steel globally.""At Monday’s press conference, N. Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Steel, told journalists that his company remains committed to building steel in Europe over the long term. “The Tata group’s approach has been to find a solution for Europe (steel operations). The discussions with Thyssenkrupp took time and there were pension issues to be resolved. There was a certain environment that was needed to create a strong JV with a strong future. This is a good solution not only for shareholders but also for employees.""",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/RenzeZacaGJCjUsTG4MbnL/Tata-Steel-comes-out-on-top-in-Thyssenkrupp-JV-agreement.html
2018-11-13,"Mumbai: Increased sales to the automotive and industrial products segments led Tata Steel, the country’s second-largest private sector steel producer, to report consolidated net profit of  ₹ 3,116 crore in the September quarter (Q2), up 206% from  ₹ 1,018 crore in the year-ago period. The company attributed this to better sales and stronger steel prices in a traditionally weak quarter.Consolidated revenue increased to  ₹ 43,544 crore in the quarter against  ₹ 32,464 crore a year ago. Over the same period, consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) increased from  ₹ 4,664 crore to  ₹ 9,000 crore. The Ebitda margin was 21% while Ebitda/tonne, a key metric of a steel producer’s profitability, was  ₹ 12,131. The company spent  ₹ 2,177 crore in capital expenditure in Q2. Consolidated steel production in the quarter was 7.26 million tonnes (mt) while deliveries stood at 7.42 mt. “This has been one of the best ever quarters for Tata Steel India on the back of strong operating and market performance... The Bhushan Steel integration and synergies have been on track and that is reflected in the Bhushan Steel Ebitda margin of  ₹ 10,291/tonne,"" Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer, said on Tuesday.In May, Tata Steel acquired Bhushan Steel Ltd under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for  ₹ 35,200 crore.One of the company’s key priorities is to reduce leverage by around a billion dollars in the next 12 months, primarily from internal cash flow and sale of non-core assets, Chatterjee said. Net debt was a little more than  ₹ 1 trillion at the end of Q2. Chatterjee said the company had already repaid about  ₹ 1,000 crore of the debt undertaken to buy Bhushan Steel since the transaction closed earlier this year.Regarding Tata Steel’s joint venture with Thyssenkrupp in Europe, T.V.

In addition, Tata Steel has also offered 12% equity stake to lenders in Bhushan Steel.Tata Steel did not respond to requests seeking details of the bid until publishing of this story.With this, Tata Steel has outbid rival JSW Steel Ltd. Mint had reported on 8 February that JSW Steel had offered Rs29,700 crore to lenders of Bhushan Steel. Tata Steel and JSW Steel were the only bidders for the debt laden steel maker and had submitted their bids on 3 February.The liquidation value of Bhushan Steel was fixed at Rs20,000 crore.

2018-02-20,"Fears that Tata Steel Ltd may be biting off more than it can chew have made investors skittish as news reports say the company is in the lead to acquire Bhushan Steel Ltd, and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd.The last time Tata Steel stretched its balance sheet to grow in size, it was to acquire Corus Plc. It took a hard fall on that one. Several restructuring attempts and asset impairment write-offs later, the European operations are set to move into a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG. If Tata Steel’s investors were settling in for a more normal ride from here on, the stressed assets’ bidding changes that.News reports indicate Tata Steel is offering an upfront payment of Rs35,000crore for Bhushan Steel for its financial creditors and Rs17,000 crore for Bhushan Power. This adds up to Rs52,000 crore, but after paying operational creditors and funding working capital, the amount may increase to Rs69,000 crore. At the financial creditors’ level, it translates to a haircut for the lenders of 38% for Bhushan Steel and 63% for Bhushan Power. The haircut in Bhushan Steel’s case seems to be less, which may be worrying investors.The upfront payment is only one aspect and the full transaction structure will give a better picture of what Tata Steel has offered, and what it is asking for in return. For instance, favourable debt refinancing terms could be one concession sought. Therefore, any premature reaction—celebratory or funereal—may be jumping the gun.What is behind Tata Steel’s interest in both companies? Bhushan Steel’s steel capacity is 5.6 million tonnes (mt), while that of Bhushan Power is 2.3mt, based on available information (Bhushan Power is unlisted). Both companies are also implementing expansion plans (including allied activities such as increasing captive power capacity) for their steel operations.The existing capacity of 7.9mt itself is substantial, considering that Tata Steel recently announced plans to expand its Odisha steel capacity by 5mt over four years, which will add to the company’s total steel capacity of 13mt.The location is another positive. Both the Bhushan plants are in Odisha, where Tata Steel’s new steel plant is also located. That should throw up opportunities of rationalizing costs across functions, and even higher operating efficiencies if possible, because of proximity of the plants. Saving costs on the corporate function is a given, as that function will become redundant and so will all the taxation-related concessions to make these stressed assets more attractive to bidders.What’s more, both companies are making profits at the Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level, with fiscal year 2017 numbers showing Bhushan Steel turned in an Ebitda margin of 17.6% at the consolidated level while Bhushan Power’s stand-alone margin was 14%. High depreciation and interest costs pushed them into losses, implying underutilization of capacity and an unfavourable capital structure.A new owner would first focus on cutting costs, improving efficiency and utilization, and then completing those half-done projects that can improve profitability in the near run. Refinancing the debt at a lower cost will also be a priority to improve the net earnings from the acquired businesses.Tata Steel’s capital structure is set to change, which should help ease the burden of this transaction. A rights issue is under way to raise Rs12,800 crore and once the European steel business moves to a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, the debt related to this business will also be lower. That should give Tata Steel breathing room for the increase in debt because of these acquisitions.Still, if not for these acquisitions, Tata Steel would have been left with a much lighter balance sheet and investors could have looked to a simpler life ahead. Now, the balance sheet will be weighed down by these acquisitions, and the additional investments needed to extract their full value. Invariably, such acquisitions are also a strain on profitability in the near-to-medium term. The longer run may see it all turn out well. But the longer run is also unpredictable, especially if the steel cycle goes against Tata Steel. Investors may have to reconcile having a new monkey on their backs.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/FyXGsFeaE4eXlE9e9Y39iM/Tata-Steels-bids-for-Bhushan-a-dj-vu-moment-for-investors.html
2018-06-30,"Frankfurt/Duesseldorf: Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG and India’s Tata Steel Ltd signed a final agreement on Saturday to establish a long-expected steel joint venture, the European steel industry’s biggest shake-up in more than a decade. The final agreement comes after months of negotiations since an initial agreement was announced in September. Both companies hope it will help them respond to challenges in the volatile steel industry, including overcapacity.The largest deal in Europe’s steel industry since the takeover of Arcelor by Laxmi Niwas Mittal in 2006, the 50-50 joint venture—to be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel—will have about 48,000 workers and about €17 billion ($19.9 billion) in sales.Based in the Netherlands, it will be the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal. It forms the core of Thyssenkrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger’s plan to turn his steel-to-submarines conglomerate into a technology company.“The joint venture not only addresses the challenges of the European steel industry,"" Hiesinger said. “It is the only solution to create significant additional value of around €5 billion for both Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel due to joint synergies which cannot be realized in a stand-alone scenario.""Tata Steel chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, in a separate statement, said the joint venture will create “a strong pan-European steel company that is structurally robust and competitive"".The deal comes as European steel makers face tariffs of 25% on their exports to the US, their biggest market. That might force local market to absorb more volume as a result.Since the tariffs were announced in late May, shares in European steelmakers ArcelorMittal, Thyssenkrupp, Salzgitter and Voestalpine have lost 8%-17%.Fresh termsHiesinger had faced pressure from activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott to extract more commitments from Tata Steel, whose European business has performed worse than Thyssenkrupp’s since the agreement was first announced, creating a valuation gap.Thyssenkrupp said the joint venture deal included “proper compensation"" for the gap, which it said was in the mid-triple-digit million-euro range: if the joint venture makes a widely expected initial public offering it would get a bigger share of the proceeds.Thyssenkrupp said it also secured the right to decide when a listing might take place, adding the joint venture was aiming for a dividend payout in the low-to-mid-triple-digit million-euro range.The German group also said it now expects annual synergies of €400 million to €500 million from the transaction. It said additional synergies were possible through managing capital expenditure and optimising working capital.Tata Steel will remain liable for environmental risks in Britain, where its Port Talbot factory, the least profitable of the joint venture, is based, said Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board.He also said that Tata Steel’s Dutch unit would be part of the joint venture’s cash-pooling mechanism. That had been a key demand for German workers concerned that Tata would give its own workers better conditions in the new company. “Yes, we do want to protect people. But we also want a company with better chances and less risks,"" Grolms said.Thyssenkrupp’s management will present a refined strategy to its supervisory board in the second week of July. People familiar with the deal said that may include a sale of its Materials Services unit and further cost cuts.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/NBX24xJtFaODQwdi6wfIgK/Tata-Steel--Thyssenkrupp-seal-landmark-steel-joint-venture.html
2018-10-21,"Mumbai: The entry of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, into the Indian market will force existing private sector players to increase efficiency and control costs, analysts say. A third steel producer, after Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd, with both financial heft and expertise, is expected to be good for the domestic market.On Friday, lenders to bankrupt Essar Steel declared that the highest bid was from the joint venture (JV) of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, promoted by Lakshmi Mittal, and Japan’s Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp. The joint venture had cleared off the  ₹ 7,469 crore of outstanding dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron—the bankrupt companies connected to Mittal—and had tabled a resolution plan that offered  ₹ 42,000 crore to buy out Essar Steel’s assets, which had accumulated debt of over  ₹ 49,000 crore.Essar steel has a 10 million tonne (mt) per annum mill in Hazira, Gujarat. The company is a fully-integrated flat steel manufacturer with ore beneficiation, pellet making, iron making, steel making, and downstream facilities, including cold rolling mill, galvanizing, pre-coated facility, steel processing facility, extra wide plate mill and a pipe mill. In its FY17 annual report, the firm had said that it was the only private steel mill in the country which was allowed to supply steel for warships, submarines, battle tanks and armoured vehicles.With Friday’s announcement, the joiint venture led by ArcelorMittal is inching towards closing the Essar Steel deal. Mittal is known to have built his career on buying out stressed steel mills across the world—in Mexico, Romania, South Africa, and the US—and turning them into profitable ventures, usually by ramping up volumes just in time for the upward steel cycle and controlling costs.Even as ArcelorMittal battles to gain control of Essar Steel in India, it is simultaneously acquiring Italy’s Ilva, Europe’s largest steelmaker by capacity.“ArcelorMittal is very good at turnarounds, at taking businesses in bad shape and making them profitable,"" said Atanu Mukherjee, president of global metals and energy consultant M.N. Dastur. “They bought the Calvert facility in US (from Thyssenkrupp AG) and it is now a world-class auto-grade steel manufacturing facility.""“Traditionally, India has had a very fragmented steel market with a lot of secondary producers,"" he added. “This is a problem because it doesn’t give you economies of scale or the pricing power, and doesn’t help cost structure. With concentration happening among 3-4 larger players and some niche players in the value-added segment supporting them, India will have a more mature steel market without creating monopolies. The steel concentration ratio is moving up faster here than in any other country, but that is good for India."" The acquisition of Arcelor by Mittal Steel in 2005 weighed the new entity’s balance sheet down with debt of $35 billion.Mittal had made several attempts to get his foot in the door in India, notably with projects planned in Odisha and Jharkhand, but neither took shape. With Essar Steel, he’s coming in not with just ready capacity to reckon with, but also at a time when India’s steel consumption is taking off. India currently has per-capita steel consumption of only 70kg a year, less than half the average of other developing nations. The World Steel Association expects Indian steel demand to climb 5.5% in 2018 and 6% in 2019, making us the fastest-growing market among the world’s top 10 steel consuming countries.“For ArcelorMittal, the opportunity is huge,"" Mukherjee of M.N. Dastur said. “The other markets that they are in—mostly in Europe, US—those are saturating. The Essar Steel plant will really lay the foundation for expansion into India. They could, in fact, even increase capacity from the current 10mt to 20-25mt over the next decade. I don’t think that’s isn’t inconceivable.""Despite nameplate capacity of 10mt, the Essar Steel mill at Hazira operates at 6-6.5mt. The bulk of its capacity is fuelled by expensive imported natural gas, unlike its competitors, who use coking coal as feedstock.“ArcelorMittal might need to invest  ₹ 2,000-2,500 crore to de-bottleneck the plant, convert some of the direct reduction - arc furnace production to potentially blast furnace - basic oxygen route, and achieve full capacity utilisation of 10mt,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage firm. “If you look at Arcelor’s balance sheet, its debt-ebitda ratio is 1.2, or 1.3. It is now in a much better position to mobilise funds for the acquisition and operation of the plant. Making this investment is far more viable in terms of cost and time of setting up a greenfield project.""Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.With automobile demand set to rise over the next decade in India, ArcelorMittal will leverage its partner Nippon Steel’s capabilities in creating high-end auto-grade flat steel.“This will be the differentiator between ArcelorMittal, and Tata Steel and JSW in India,"" Mukherjee said. “The latter two are very good, and have partnerships with Nippon Steel and JFE Holdings, respectively. But ArcelorMittal has a long storied history in building steel for automobiles, in AHSS (advanced high-strength steels). This is where Arcelor is the best in the business.""",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/Nq8Q2uOM6FzUd5orkaApyJ/ArcelorMittal-entry-set-to-heat-up-Indias-steel-industry.html
2018-05-17,"Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd. is preparing a Rs11,500 crore ($1.7 billion) loan to help fund its purchase of assets from Bhushan Steel Ltd., people familiar with the matter said.The producer is in talks with banks about a six-month bridge facility, which it aims to refinance with a loan that would mature in about 15 years, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.The acquisition would help Mumbai-based Tata in its goal to double production in five years, as it also plans further expansion at its Kalinganagar plant. The new facility would be the largest Indian local-currency loan since HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd.’s Rs13,440 crore, signed in May 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Lenders in talks with Tata for the loan include Axis Bank Ltd., HDFC Bank Ltd., IndusInd Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Plc, State Bank of India and Yes Bank Ltd., the people said.

2018-03-28,"Duesseldorf/Frankfurt: Plans by Thyssenkrupp AG and Tata Steel Ltd to combine their European steel operations face renewed opposition from German unions, who say the companies’ labour agreement in the Netherlands goes too far in protecting work and sites there.Last month Tata Steel guaranteed its Dutch division it could continue to operate as an independent company within the planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, with control over its own profits and an independent supervisory board.The plant in IJmuiden would remain a “fully integrated steel company"", Tata Steel Netherlands said. Tata Steel also operates a plant in Port Talbot, Britain.“It is not acceptable that only we in Germany are to be responsible for the risks of the joint venture and the Dutch entity is dodging responsibility,"" Thyssenkrupp supervisory board member Tekin Nasikkol told Reuters, adding German employees would not accept this. “We will not accept a free state of IJmuiden.""The planned tie-up will be discussed at an extraordinary meeting of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board on April 12, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last year announced plans to combine their European steel operations to create the continent’s second-largest player after ArcelorMittal, including up to 4,000 job cuts.Thyssenkrupp and Tata have said the deal will help them tackle overcapacity in Europe’s steel market, which faces cheap imports, subdued construction demand and inefficient old plants.The signing of the deal was originally planned for the beginning of the year but a key condition is still lacking: a final labour agreement between Tata Steel and its workers in Britain and the Netherlands.Last month, steel workers at Germany’s Thyssenkrupp voted in favour of a labour agreement that will safeguard jobs and plants in a planned joint venture with Tata Steel until 2026, removing a key hurdle for the tie-up.Dutch union members still have to approve a similar preliminary agreement with Tata Steel, and are waiting for a positive opinion from Tata’s Dutch workers representative committee before they give their final consent.“That will probably still take several months,"" Peter Boeseken, a spokesman of Dutch union CNV, said, adding Tata and ThyssenKrupp could proceed with the joint venture without consent “as long as no irreversible measure are taken"".Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.Although not essential to the creation of the planned joint venture, workers’ approval of the labour agreement is seen as a precondition to getting the deal done as it removes the risk of strikes and potential delays.

2018-07-06,"Duesseldorf/Frankfurt: Thyssenkrupp will take its time to replace chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger after his resignation, dampening hopes of a speedy restructuring or even a break-up of the German industrial group.Hiesinger’s resignation came less than a week after he sealed a landmark joint venture deal with Tata Steel, the culmination of two years of negotiations that in the end came too late to placate investors hungry for change.Activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott had criticized Thyssenkrupp’s performance under Hiesinger, with shares down 28% since he took office in January 2011. There have been calls to break up the company that spans submarines, elevators and car parts.The board did not appoint an interim CEO, but said it had asked the remaining executives—Guido Kerkhoff, Oliver Burkhard and Donatus Kaufmann—to lead the company for now.“In this difficult situation it is most important now for the company to remain on course,"" the supervisory board’s chairman Ulrich Lehner said in a statement.The chief executive had been set to present a revamped strategy for the group, which was forged by the merger of two German steel groups founded in the 19th century. Such a presentation now looks likely to be delayed.“The succession to Dr Heinrich Hiesinger as chief executive will follow in a structured process,"" Thyssenkrupp said, without providing details on possible candidates or a timeline.Thyssenkrupp’s stock jumped as much as 6.6% to the top of the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 index on Friday before giving up some of its gains to trade 1.7% higher by 1415 GMT.Hiesinger, 58, was brought in to turn around Thyssenkrupp seven years ago after it lost billions of euros in an ill-fated venture in the Americas that had forced his predecessor Ekkehard Schulz to step down.The former Siemens executive vowed to fix the “disaster"" at the group, axing half his management board amid losses and corruption allegations. He presided over Thyssenkrupp’s protracted exit from its volatile steel business, whose roots go back more than 200 years and provided the company’s backbone for many generations.But his shareholder backing dwindled during his quest to simplify the group’s structure while still keeping it intact.“We welcome the CEO’s resignation as this could be a sign of a change of strategy, a move toward the split of the company’s assets and the end of the conglomerate discount,"" said Frederic Guignard, European equities fund manager at Aviva Investors, a top-30 investor in Thyssenkrupp.Breaking up conglomerates is tougher in Germany than, for example, in the United States, mainly because of the power of labour unions on German company boards. “Now there is an opportunity to develop a new strategy, to advance restructuring and to reposition the group,"" said Ingo Speich, fund manager at Union Investment, which holds about $28.5 million worth of Thyssenkrupp stock.“A successor should therefore add a new perspective rather than hold on to the existing strategy,"" he added.The resignation was the fourth by a German blue-chip company’s CEO in as many months, after the chiefs of Deutsche Bank, Volkswagen and Beiersdorf.Hiesinger “was apparently sick of letting himself be worn down by divergent interests at Thyssenkrupp,"" Independent Research analyst Sven Diermeier said.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/qhd4CosCkS3p18MpjeKpJI/Thyssenkrupp-CEO-Heinrich-Hiesinger-resigns-after-Tata-Steel.html

It was, however, clarified that the acquisition process would be subject to the final outcome of the appeal.The NCLAT bench issued notice to the resolution professional, committee of creditors and Tata Steel, asking them to file their replies within seven days.The bench also asked Tata Steel to enclose the relevant portion of its resolution plan for Bhushan Steel, disclosing the proposals for financial creditors, operational creditors, secured and unsecured creditors as well as shareholders and submit an estimated deadline for the execution of its resolution.Notices were also issued to two more parties—Bhushan Steel Employees Union and Larsen and Toubro Ltd—that had raised objections against the resolution plan submitted by Tata Steel before the NCLT.Counsel appearing for Singal, UK Chaudhary, argued that Tata Steel was ineligible to bid in view of Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Chaudhary further sought setting aside of the resolution process for Bhushan Steel arguing it was “illegal"".L&T, which has a claim of over Rs900 crore against Bhushan Steel, has moved a separate appeal against the approval granted to Tata Steel’s resolution plan, saying that it is oppressive against operational creditors.On 15 May, The NCLT’s principal bench approved Tata Steel’s resolution plan promising an upfront payment of Rs35,200 crore to lenders, along with a 12.27% stake in the steel maker.Pursuant to the order, Tata Steel has reportedly acquired a controlling stake of 72.65% in Bhushan Steel for around Rs36,400 crore.The appeal will be next heard on 30 May.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/7E5LHouiwRoJZqw7M94nqN/NCLAT-issues-notice-to-Tata-Steel-over-sale-of-Bhushan-Steel.html

He will also chair the management board of Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV, the joint venture.Goss is currently chief executive officer of Thyssenkrupp’s steel division.Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp AG signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their European steel businesses in a 50/50 joint venture. The proposed new company, to be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV, headquartered in the Amsterdam area, will be a pan-European flat steel producer. The joint venture is subject to merger control clearance in several jurisdictions, including in the European Union.Hans Fischer, currently the CEO of Tata Steel Europe, will be the deputy CEO and chief technology officer of the new company. Sandip Biswas, currently the group executive vice-president (finance) of Tata Steel Ltd, is the designated chief financial officer while Premal Desai, currently the chief financial officer of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, will be the chief strategy officer of the joint venture.Apart from the above appointments, Tata Steel said in its release that it will announce the next management level for the joint venture early in the new year.“The management board and the future top leadership team will be responsible for the planning and execution of the post-merger integration and the long-term business strategy once the planned joint venture has received the necessary regulatory approvals and after closing,"" the release said.Until the completion of the merger process, Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe and Tata Steel in Europe will continue to operate as separate companies and as competitors and the incumbent organisation of the respective companies will continue to operate as currently. The members of the designated management board will continue in their existing roles within their businesses until the formation of the joint venture post all regulatory approvals.The European Commission has launched a deeper investigation into the Tata Steel-Thyssenkrupp merger over concerns that the joint venture would gain majority market share and hence affect competition in steel for the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and grain-oriented electrical steel.At the time of the announcement of the joint venture, the companies had said that due diligence and fairness opinions had confirmed the economic viability of the new company and the expected annual recurring synergies of approximately €400-500 million.“After closing, the synergies will be generated in several areas, including procurement, consolidation of overheads and through a better asset utilization.

Ramadorai, will be replaced by Tata Sons president (infrastructure, defence and aerospace) Banmali Agrawala, while AirAsia Group chief executive Tony Fernandes and deputy group chief executive Bo Lingam, have also stepped down from the AirAsia India board.Mint couldn’t independently verify this.The report added that AirAsia India is likely to undergo a leadership reshuffle under Agrawala.“We are delighted to welcome Mr Bhaskaran as the new CEO & MD of AirAsia India. With India’s aviation sector growing at a rapid pace, we are confident his extensive experience, ability to drive performance and work seamlessly with all stakeholders will be a great asset for AirAsia India,"" said Ramadorai.The Tata Group did not offer comments on the issue.Agrawala also did not offer any comments.The changes come in the backdrop of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on 29 May raiding the offices of AirAsia India, after filing a complaint against Fernandes and others on 28 May, for allegedly lobbying the government for overseas flight permits and violating rules that prevent foreign airlines from controlling Indian operators.CBI’s first information report (FIR) said that the violations occurred from 2013 to 2016, before the government eased restrictions on Indian airlines starting overseas flights in June 2016.AirAsia India has in a statement denied any wrongdoing and said it had co-operated with all regulators and agencies to present the facts.However, Mint had on 1 June reported that key decisions across the board at AirAsia India needed approval from Malaysian shareholder AirAsia Group Bhd, quoting from the brand licence agreement between the two entities. In India, regulations state that effective control of airline companies jointly owned by Indian and foreign entities should lie with the domestic company.“The move (to put Bhaskaran at the helm of AirAsia India) shows that the Tata group wants to retain control and decision-making at AirAsia India,"" said an airline executive, who did not want to be named.AirAsia India, which started operations in June 2014, has 19 aircraft in its fleet and plans to begin international operations soon.The airline also has plans to add up to 70 aircraft to its fleet over the next four to five years as it seeks to aggressively expand services, domestic market share, and network, Mint had reported in February.The company, which had a market share of 4.7% in August 2018, carried 537,000 passengers during the month, according to data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/pEsO4i27qJIrxlCe5YdbYI/AirAsia-India-likely-to-appoint-Tata-Steels-Sunil-Bhaskaran.html

The two-member bench at NCLT also asked the COC to submit a detailed date-wise development from 20 November last year to 8 February.The last date for submission of bids was 8 February.The bid was rejected by the legal team of the interim resolution professional (IRP) without opening as it was submitted on 20 February, much after the 8 February deadline set by the IRP for submission of bids. Liberty House approached NCLT on 22 February following the rejection. The next hearing of the case is scheduled on 5 March.Liberty House has also contended that the committee of creditors should have the ultimate right to reject the bid and not the resolution professional. Two other bidders who submitted the bids for Bhushan Power are JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd. Both submitted bids before the deadline. Tata Steel is said to have emerged as the highest bidder for Sanjay Singhal-owned Bhushan Power and Steel with an offer to pay Rs17,000 crore to lenders and infuse additional cash of Rs7,000 crore for working capital and payments to operational creditors and employees.JSW made an offer of Rs11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs2,000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm.

Both Mehta and Kadam raised objections to a plea moved by the employees of Bhushan Steel, challenging the acceptance of Tata Steel’s bid for being in violation of Section 29A of the IBC Code. Section 29A (d) of the Code makes a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more ineligible from submitting a resolution plan. Tata Steel UK, a foreign subsidiary of Tata Steel, was fined £1.4m over violation of health and safety norms by an English Court in February 2018. It was argued that the plea brought by the employees failed to show how Tata Steel’s resolution plan adversely affected them, when, in fact, it secured their financial and employment status. A.S. Chandiok, appearing for Bhushan Steel employees, submitted that CoC’s decision of “not rejecting"" Tata Steel’s bid for being disqualified under Section 29A(d) was “not informed"" and said that the IRP was under a statutory obligation to provide reasons for arriving at a decision in a “speaking order"".

On Monday, NCLAT heard the arguments made by the counsel appearing for Tata Steel and adjourned the hearing of the matter to 1 November.Last week, more than two-thirds of lenders to BPSL voted in favour of a revised offer by JSW Steel, turning on the heat in a contest for an asset that is also being pursued by Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House.In the initial round of bidding, BPSL received bids of  ₹ 11,000 crore from JSW Steel,  ₹ 17,000 crore from Tata Steel and  ₹ 18,500 crore from Liberty House.

2018-03-25,"The shotgun marriages being conducted through the insolvency process have not been without controversy or twists. Bhushan Steel Ltd’s resolution is nearing completion, with Tata Steel Ltd emerging as the winning bidder.But bids for Essar Steel Ltd, another distressed steel major, ran into trouble with the eligibility of both bidders Numetal Mauritius and ArcelorMittal being called into question. A second round of bidding will be conducted, which allows those who submitted an expression of interest in the first round to bid again.What happens next, will more than two bidders emerge and who is likely to get Essar Steel? There are two parts to this.One part pertains to the two companies who submitted a first bid: Numetal and ArcelorMittal. They need to rid themselves of the defects that made their bids ineligible. ArcelorMittal may get there soon, as Uttam Galva Steels Ltd announced that ArcelorMittal is no longer in its promoter category.If this is accepted, then ArcelorMittal will no longer be a promoter of a company that has defaulted on its bank loans. That will put it on the right side of Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which among other things prohibits promoters of any defaulting company from bidding in the resolution process.In Numetal’s case, it has filed a case in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to declare itself as an eligible bidder and the suit is scheduled to come up for hearing on 4 April, according to a Mint report. What remains to be seen is if Numetal pursues that route or chooses an alternative one. In its case, Essar Steel’s promoter group owned a stake in Numetal. News reports had indicated that Numetal had offered to correct this, to become eligible. Which route they take, legal or stake sale, is not certain but Numetal can be expected to bid again. That’s two bids in the bag, for sure.What about the rest? That they did not submit final bids is proof they were not interested, for some reason. There’s Tata Steel Ltd, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., Vedanta Group and Steel Authority of India Ltd. Still, one must consider the possibility of a rethink.Last week, it was announced that Tata Steel was successful in its bid for Bhushan Steel Ltd, which itself involves a substantial outlay. If Tata Steel also wins the bid for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd, whose resolution is currently on hold due to litigation, its appetite will be fully sated. Chances of it re-bidding for Essar Steel appear negligible at this point.ArcelorMittal had said in early-March that its bid for Essar Steel included Nippon Steel as a joint venture partner. It also said it was always the intention to bid together. One can therefore assume the second bid will also be a combined one, and Nippon Steel will not bid separately.The Vedanta Group has the financial power to participate in this resolution. But it has also submitted a final bid for Electrosteel Steels Ltd, and in a recent interview to ET Now, seen on economictimes.com, group chief Anil Agrawal said he was not interested in Essar Steel. That rules them also out, for now.Steel Authority of India Ltd may have reasons to be interested in Essar Steel but its own financial performance has just begun to look up. When other steel majors were reporting good results in FY18 on the back of rising steel prices, Sail was incurring losses in the first half, partly due to higher depreciation and interest costs.With a debt-to-equity ratio of 1:1.3, Sail has enough on its plate, one would think. It has invested in modernization and capacity expansion, with some way to go before it is completed. If that’s why it decided against submitting a final bid, it was a wise decision and it may decide to stay away in the second round as well.That then brings us back to ArcelorMittal (with Nippon Steel in tow) and Numetal as the chief contenders, barring any surprise change of mind among the others. Since eligibility will not be in question now, the main concerns will be the financial offer and industry experience.On the industry experience front, ArcelorMittal at present has an advantage though Numetal also has an option to bring in another steel major as a JV partner. Numetal’s majority shareholder is Russia’s VTB Bank. On the financial front, both companies appear to have the firepower needed for an aggressive bid. With Bhushan Steel gone, this is the last remaining large distressed steel asset on offer. The financial details of the bids are not known, one does not know what the companies had offered. Irrespective of that, Bhushan Steel’s resolution process has set the bar high. One can expect aggressive financial bids, with ArcelorMittal or Numetal set to emerge as the winning bidder.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/aY45y2irX04o3NLEybZckI/The-curious-case-of-who-will-acquire-Essar-Steel.html
2018-02-11,"Mumbai: A combine of ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, Tata Steel and NuMetal Mauritius, a consortium of Russia’s VTB Capital and the Ruia family, are expected to submit binding bids for debt-laden Essar Steel, the deadline for which ends on Monday, at least three people with direct knowledge of the ongoing bidding process of the company said.Mining baron Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd and Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel, who were earlier tipped to be among the contenders for Essar Steel, which is currently under corporate insolvency proceedings, have decided to not bid for the asset, the people cited above said.The liquidation value of Essar Steel has been fixed at Rs20,000 crore, they said.With this, the final ownership of Essar Steel is likely to be a three-way fight, but legal challenges remain around the bids of both ArcelorMittal and Numetal. ArcelorMittal itself has been a corporate defaulter as a shareholder in distressed steelmaker Uttam Galva Steel, which is also in the Reserve Bank of India’s ( RBI) second list of companies set to face bankruptcy proceedings. NuMetal too may face scrutiny under the amended bankruptcy laws that bar defaulting promoters from bidding for the assets. Current Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) laws don’t allow defaulter promoters to bid for assets under insolvency.Essar Steel owed lenders around Rs45,000 crore, of which Rs31,671 crore had become non-performing as of 31 March 2016. The company owes as much as 93% of this amount to a consortium of 22 creditors led by State Bank of India, Mint reported in August.Essar Steel Hazira is the country’s largest single-location flat steel plant. The complex also houses a 30 million tonne per annum (mtpa), all-weather, deep draft, dry bulk port and a 515MW natural gas-operated power plant. Mint reported in October that Tata Steel Ltd had expressed preliminary interest in acquiring debt-laden Essar Steel’s Hazira plant in Gujarat. Apart from the Hazira plant, Essar Steel operates a downstream capability hub in Pune, beneficiation plants in Bailadila (Chhattisgarh) and Dabuna (Odisha) and pellet manufacturing plants in Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Paradip (Odisha).

The EoIs were submitted by Tata Steel Ltd, Numetal Mauritius, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., Vedanta Group, Arcelor Mittal and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL).“Lenders believe that inviting new bidders will result in repeating the entire diligence process which may lead to missing the 29 April deadline for completing the IBC process,"" said one of the bankers cited earlier. “Also, it’s important to keep new bidders outside to maintain the sanctity of the process,"" the banker added.Mint had reported on Wednesday that JSW Steel Ltd may bid for the stressed asset if lenders permits new bidders. JSW has submitted a letter to the insolvency resolution professional showing interest in the bidding process. “If the firm is not allowed to bid in the fresh round, it will consider joining hands with other eligible bidders who have already submitted EOIs,"" said another person close to the development.A JSW Steel spokesperson declined to comment.On Wednesday, the committee of creditors decided to reopen bidding after declaring Arcelor Mittal and Numetal Mauritius ineligible under Section 29 (a) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code. The clause bars wilful defaulters, defaulters whose dues had been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) for more than a year, and all related entities of these firms from participating in the resolution process. In Arcelor Mittal’s case, the firm had a stake in Uttam Galva Steel Ltd, a delinquent borrower, while in Numetal’s case, one of its minority shareholders is owned by a trust that has Rewant Ruia, son of Essar Group’s co-founder as a beneficiary. “Both companies will have to make themselves eligible before they can submit fresh bids,"" said the first banker. “Arcelor will have to declassify themselves as a promoter of Uttam Galva whereas VTB will have to drop Rewant Ruia as consortium partner to be to be eligible to bid,"" he added. VTB is the largest shareholder of Numetal.On Wednesday, before the creditor panel arrived at its decision, Numetal filed a petition at the Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to determine its eligibility as a resolution applicant. The firm said the creditor panel decision would be subject to the order passed by the court.Essar Steel is one of the 12 bad loan accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India for early resolution under the insolvency code.

2018-12-25,"New Delhi: In the second half of 2018, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd began thinking of life beyond Gurugram. It had become far too cumbersome to continue manufacturing cars in the middle of a city which had turned into a bustling megapolis in the blink of an eye. This marks the end of an era—Maruti’s spell in Gurgaon, which dates back to the early 1980s, is an ode to India’s economic transformation. What Jamshedpur is to Tata Steel Ltd, Gurgaon is to Maruti. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint
India of the early 1980s was a strange place. It was a time when the central government thought it knew how best to manufacture passenger cars; when defective fuel pumps in Maruti 800’s early fleet became a matter of parliamentary debate; and when India’s nascent forays into the realm of global automotive competence had to first bypass the pesky problem of dust (Maruti found its home in the southern edge of Delhi by keeping the air pressure inside the shop floor artificially higher than outside at all times).For a long time, the existence of Maruti in 2018 was far from a certainty. That could be said about Gurgaon too, which began as a dusty, barren backyard of Delhi and got its initial boost by playing host to a spunky Indo-Japanese joint venture company which grew into one of the world’s largest small carmakers. With the birth of the millennium city and the ‘people’s car’ so entwined, it’s hardly surprising that the Gurgaon-based Maruti plant evokes much nostalgia. What Jamshedpur is to Tata Steel Ltd, Gurgaon is to Maruti.Reminiscing about the good old days at a recent company event, Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said when Osamu Suzuki (of Suzuki Motor Co.) first came to visit the under-construction campus, he was quite taken aback to see it being overrun with monkeys. “He asked me how we would make cars here if the monkeys continue to be around?"" said Bhargava. Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint
“I told Mr. Suzuki that Maruti is another name for Lord Hanuman and assured him that once manufacturing started, they will all leave the place. As predicted, the monkeys vanished once the plant was commissioned,"" he added.That oft-repeated, possibly apocryphal story is a good yardstick for the myth and magic realism that has come to be associated with Maruti’s rise. However, the reality of modern-day, congested Gurgaon doesn’t leave much room for magic. Suzuki Motor Co. chairman Osamu Suzuki. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint
“When Maruti started making cars, there was no National Highway (NH) 8 and Gurgaon was a village. Today, if you take the NH 8 on a normal day, it is perennially chocked with traffic due to the truck movement that takes place between the plants of Maruti and its suppliers,"" said a person who has been associated with the carmaker since its inception, requesting not to be named. When residents in the vicinity began to repeatedly lodge complaints with the civic body, the writing on the wall was clear.The existing factory in Gurgaon will probably still be used for manufacturing engines and testing vehicles. But new cars will no longer roll out of the campus.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/wM1ezexHQ9tE2RL8LpXdxL/The-end-of-an-era-Maruti-drives-off-Gurugram.html
2018-12-08,"Duesseldorf/London : Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and India’s Tata Steel are close to deciding who will lead their planned European steel joint venture, four people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Settling on the venture’s leadership has been delayed by a strategy crisis and change of CEO at the German industrial conglomerate, which has said it would split into two companies. The holdup has riled the Thyssenkrupp workforce. A labour leader on Wednesday said there would be “trouble"" if the matter was not resolved soon.Andreas Goss, head of Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit, is the front runner to become chief executive of the combined entity, which will be Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, the people said.The new company will have around 48,000 workers and about 17 billion euros ($19.4 billion) in sales, with production facilities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Goss, seen as well connected in the industry, has led Thyssenkrupp’s steel division since 2014. The unit’s adjusted operating profit rose by 26 percent to 687 million euros over the past financial year.His appointment would further strengthen Thyssenkrupp’s position in the 50-50 venture, which already includes a greater share of proceeds should the entity be listed on the stock exchange, which is widely expected.Signed in June, the planned entity still needs European antitrust approval, which is expected towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. The groups might have to divest assets to secure approval, sources have previously said.Hans Fischer, chief executive of Tata Steel’s European subsidiary, is also likely to join the venture’s management board, the people said, adding it was unclear how many seats the board would have.Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in June said the joint venture’s management board would consist of six members, shared equally between both groups.That number could be reduced to four to give a more focused structure to the entity, which will be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the people said.A decision will be announced very soon, the people said. Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said last month a decision on the joint venture’s leadership would be made before Christmas.“The joint venture would have a two-tier management structure comprising a management board and a supervisory board,"" a Tata Steel spokesman said.“Both boards would have equal representation from Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel,"" he said, adding further announcements will be made “in due course"".When asked about the issue, a spokesman for Thyssenkrupp referred back to Kerkhoff’s remarks.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

2018-09-21,"London: The smoking towers of the Port Talbot steelworks have dominated the South Wales skyline for more than a century. If they’re to continue to do so for decades to come, they’ll need to make more money.The past decade has seen some of the most traumatic years for the plant. Hurt by the global financial crisis and then by a commodity-price collapse in 2015, site owner Tata Steel Ltd. struggled to make money in the UK. It has sold most of its British assets, bought as part of a $12 billion deal just a decade ago, but still runs Port Talbot after abandoning a sale process in 2016.“The objective of any site should be that it can take care of itself. That’s your best guarantee for the future,"" said T. V. Narendran, managing director of Mumbai-based Tata Steel. “The effort put in in the last three years has brought the business to 60% of where it should be.""While the curtailment of cheap Chinese supply has helped the market recover in the past couple of years, Tata is merging its European steel operations with German rival Thyssenkrupp AG to better compete. Though the companies say this will create a stronger business on the continent -- second only to ArcelorMittal -- Tata’s UK operations have long underperformed its Dutch assets and Thyssenkrupp’s German plants.Site commitmentFor now, Tata remains committed to Port Talbot. It’s working on extending the life of one of the two blast furnaces and has pledged to run both of them until at least 2022. After that it will come down to performance.“A lot depends on our ability to continue to improve the performance in the UK, and to continue to generate cash in the UK and run a competitive business there,"" Narendran said. “We are also waiting to see the outcome of Brexit and what the impact of that is on our operations, and then we will decide.""British steelmaking has been in decline for more than a century, eclipsed by the US by the start of World War I and later overtaken by Germany. In the 1970s and 1980s, inefficient and outdated plants saw production slump, falling behind France, Italy and Belgium. More recently, a lack of investment, higher energy costs and a tough regulatory environment have hurt UK steelmakers that once produced about 40% of global supply.Tata also faces Brexit uncertainty. With just six months until the UK is set to leave the European Union and lawmakers from both sides yet to reach an agreement, the steel producer says it’s preparing for the worst.Until “the terms of Brexit are clear, it’s difficult for us,"" Narendran said. “It will impact us because 30% to 40% is exported. We will be impacted because of what happens to the pound. We will be impacted by what happens to our customers. There are multiple moving parts.""Still, Tata said much preparation can be done in advance to ensure supply chains between the Netherlands and U.K. run as smoothly as possible, and that it has been given pointers from the British government to help that.“There are too many ifs and buts now,"" said Narendran. “It’s a question of adjusting to a new way of life and adapting to that.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

2018-10-29,"Kolkata: Prashant Jhawar and Rajeev Jhawar, co-promoters of Usha Martin Ltd, have for now put aside their differences over the sale of the company’s steel business and cleared the deck for its takeover by Tata Sponge Iron Ltd. Prashant Jhawar, who along with his father Basant Kumar Jhawar owns 25.5% in Usha Martin, on Monday issued a statement saying he would vote in favour of the proposed sale of the unit at the shareholders’ meeting on 10 November. “We have also conveyed our decision to the lead banker—State Bank of India,"" Prashant Jhawar said.The company’s shares on Monday closed at  ₹ 26.50 on BSE, down 3.28% in a flat market.In April 2017, Prashant Jhawar was ousted as non-executive chairman by the company’s lenders and has since been fighting legal battles against his cousin Rajeev Jhawar, who continues to be the managing director.In September this year, the Tata group agreed to acquire Usha Martin’s 1 million tonne steel unit for  ₹ 4,500 crore, adjusted for working capital deployed at the time of closure of the transaction. The steel business includes iron ore and coal mines in Jharkhand, which are also to be transferred to the Tata group.The cash generated from the proposed sale will be used to repay Usha Martin’s debts. The company’s wire-rope division will then be indebted to the tune of  ₹ 300-400 crore, which it can “easily service"" from its cash flow, said a company official, who asked not to be named.Usha Martin produces around 150,000 tonnes of wire rope a year.Prashant Jhawar said though he has agreed to support the sale of the steel unit, his “concerns"" over utilisation of the sale proceeds such as clearing so-called contingent liabilities to the tune of  ₹ 860 crore “remain unaddressed"".These liabilities include claims made by the state government of Jharkhand because of “irregularities in mining operations allegedly carried out by the present management,"" he said.London-based Prashant Jhawar, who has distanced himself from the day-to-day operations of Usha Martin, appears to have realised that the sale of the steel unit will benefit all stakeholders, said the company executive cited above.Usha Martin had earlier planned to sell its wire-rope division and keep the steel unit. It had even engaged Royal Bank of Canada as an investment banker to advise it on the sale of the unit.Although the management has always held the more profitable wire-rope division as the company’s core strength, the board was initially skeptical about finding a buyer for it. In June, Usha Martin’s board agreed to explore the sale of the steel unit looking at the interest shown in distressed assets by companies such as Tata Steel Ltd and ArcelorMittal SA.With Prashant Jhawar coming around, the proposal to sell the steel unit is expected to get shareholders’ approval, according to the executive cited above. The company now needs regulatory clearance from the Jharkhand government and the central government to conclude the deal.This may take four to five months, added the person quoted above.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/gpRpznNb9ix6hbJWR5V6dI/Usha-Martin-promoters-put-aside-differences-over-sale-to-Tat.html
2018-10-14,"Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd plans to “eventually"" scale up the nameplate capacity at its newly-acquired Tata Steel BSL (BSL), formerly Bhushan Steel Ltd, to 8.3 million tonnes (mtpa) from 5.6 mtpa.The plan was laid out by Rajeev Singhal, the new managing director of Tata Steel BSL, in an article published in the July-September edition of the Tata Review, an internal magazine of the Tata group. Tata Steel had on 18 May acquired Bhushan Steel in a  ₹ 35,300 crore deal under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. At the time, Bhushan Steel was operating at 3.5mtpa, far below its installed capacity.Tata Steel executives said later that said synergies between the two companies have commenced, with slabs from Bhushan Steel’s factory sent to Tata Steel, while the former is gaining from coal procurement and product shipping lines of Tata Steel.A Tata Steel spokesperson did not offer a timeline for the capacity expansion.Singhal said the aim is to make the Bhushan Steel plant run at full capacity within two years. “Our immediate focus area is to stabilize operations and realize the full potential of the company,"" he said, according to the magazine.“The aspiration is to reach an EBITDA margin of 25% on purchased raw material basis and be the benchmark,"" he said. Tata Steel, excluding Bhushan Steel, had an Ebitda margin of 31% in the April-June quarter.Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.“Tata Steel’s plan is to eventually converge the EBITDA per tonne metric of Bhushan Steel with its own plant in Kalinganagar,"" said a metals analyst. He did not wish to be named as Tata has yet to officially announce the plans.“Tata Steel has several captive iron ore mines in and around Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar, and with a small amount of capital expenditure, this can also be made available to the Bhushan Steel plant to ramp up capacity,"" said the analyst. “Once they get permission to increase production from their captive iron ore mines, these reserves can be used for Bhushan as well.""Tata Steel, which trails JSW Steel, has been aggressive in its plans to become the largest private sector steel producer in India. The company has already begun expansion work at the Kalinganagar plant in Odisha from 5 to 8mtpa. It earlier said the capacity at Kalinganagar would be eventually ramped up to 16mtpa.In the same article, Koushik Chatterjee, Tata Steel’s executive director and chief financial officer said: “I won’t call this a race (to the top). The primary focus is running your own course. It is important to be value-driven, rather than just volume-driven…(But) we will certainly be aggressive in the market place and in volume growth.""The analyst said “the problem that the erstwhile promoters of Bhushan Steel faced was that they went aggressive on expansion at the wrong time, as a result of which working capital dried up. Eventually, so much of the earnings went into servicing debt that they could not take advantage of higher steel prices. If you don’t have adequate working capital, then you can’t fund the next production cycle, especially in a capital-intensive business like steelmaking.""The infusion of working capital, which the Tata Steel will bring, will be enough to revive Bhushan Steel, he added.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/4XlSLU6yqWVSldJZvlQptI/Tata-Steel-plans-capacity-expansion-at-Bhushan-Steel-plant.html
2018-02-25,"London: Tata Steel is seeking UK government backing for a £60 million project at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, according to a media report on Sunday. The project is aimed at overhauling a production line at Port Talbot to be able to make lighter steel for car-making, which is expected to secure the future of Britain’s largest steel operation. The Indian steel giant is believed to have informally requested financial support from the government to upgrade its continuous annealing process line (CAPL) to make lighter, thinner and stronger galvanised steels, the Sunday Times reported. The move is aimed at meeting demands from the automotive sector, which is trying to slash the weight of cars to cut emissions. Industry people in the know told the newspaper that UK taxpayer support for the CAPL upgrade was integral to Tata committing to reline an ageing blast furnace. Without the extra investment, one of the two towering furnaces that convert iron ore into molten iron is due to finish operations by the end of next year. Tata Steel is understood to be working on a plan to extend the furnace’s life until about 2026. However, this plan falls short of a full relining, which would cost about £150 million. Maintaining Port Talbot’s two furnaces is seen by workers’ unions and the UK government as crucial to the survival of the plant, which has about 4,000 workers. In September 2017, UK business secretary Greg Clark wrote to Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, asking for a “specific commitment"" to the relining. Chandrasekaran said overhauling the site would help “develop the business viability"" for the reline — but fell short of a commitment.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/V2isulN6nuOi61paC9At1I/Tata-Steel-said-to-be-seeking-UK-government-funds-for-Wales.html

This is expected to give us about 72.65% equity in the company and close to 100% of economic interest in the company because of the way in which the transaction has been structured,"" Tata Steel told PTI in an e-mailed response. From a financing perspective, it said, the transaction is largely financed by “our cash and incremental debt is only about Rs16,500 crores which will be raised on the target balance sheet eventually"". The company said Bhushan Steel will have about Rs16,500 crore of secured debt and it would be contributing significant amount of its own capital into the Bhushan Steel, so the incremental capital structure will be healthy and sustainable for the future. “And we believe that with synergies getting realized over a period of time, we have a good match between the earnings capability of the entire facilities and assets and the capital structure that we are putting in,"" it said. Stressing that Bhushan Steel has been a very important acquisition for the company, it said Bhushan Steel’s Odisha plant is 150 km away from Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant.“It is a running plant with good facilities and we believe it will complement our existing footprint, not only in Odisha but also in the important markets that we operate in. We hope to achieve a kind of 100% ramp up in the next couple of years, and we see significant scope for additional synergies and improvement in the operating KPIs (key performance indicators),"" the steel giant said.

Ltd moved the Kolkata bench of the NCLT alleging in two separate petitions that both Tata Steel and Vedanta were ineligible for bidding under section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) because they have been found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail.Tata Steel and Vedanta were not immediately available for comments. Dhaivat Anjaria, the resolution professional, also could not be contacted immediately.In its order, the bench directed the resolution professional to inform Renaissance Steel about his stand on the eligibility of Tata Steel and Vedanta within three days, following which Renaissance Steel is to hand in written objections, if any, to the resolution professional’s views. The bench further directed the resolution professional to place Renaissance Steel’s objections before Electrosteel Steels’ committee of creditors, according to two lawyers who had seen the order. They asked not to be named.Renaissance Steel had alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd, a subsidiary, had pleaded guilty several times to violating the UK Health and Safety at Work Act. The company faced multiple prosecutions and was convicted each time, Renaissance Steel said in its petition. The offences were punishable with two years in jail, but the UK authorities chose to impose fines.Under section 29A of IBC, anyone convicted in a criminal case punishable with two or more years in jail is barred from bidding for stressed assets.Similarly, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc—Vedanta’s UK-based holding company—had violated pollution norms in Zambia, Renaissance Steel said. Konkola Copper Mines of the Vedanta group had in 2010 pleaded guilty to four charges brought against it under pollution laws. Some of these offences were punishable with three years in jail, the Renaissance Steel petition said.Renaissance Steel had said that the resolution professional accepted the so-called undertaking of eligibility at “face value"", whereas he was “duty-bound to examine the issue of eligibility"" before receiving the bids. Enough information was readily available in the public domain to question the eligibility of Tata Steel and Vedanta, Renaissance Steel said in its petition.Though the resolution professional has received bids, the creditors haven’t decided yet on a resolution plan for Electrosteel Steels.

2018-06-12,"London:Tata Steel’s proposed joint venture with German steel major Thyssenkrupp is likely to be hit by delays as workers and investors questioned the viability of the current business plan.Representatives from the Tata Steel European Works Council (EWC), formed to address issues of transnational interest that significantly affect the Indian steel company’s employees in Europe, said in a statement this week that they remained “unconvinced"" and also found Thyssenkrupp’s lack of engagement with them “deeply regrettable"". “The EWC acknowledges there is an industrial rationale for pursuing this JV, but with the matters outstanding the EWC remains unconvinced that this partnership with Thyssenkrupp would be in the best interests of the TSE (Tata Steel Europe) operations and the employees we represent,"" the statement notes.“At this stage there are still significant gaps in our knowledge which makes it difficult to reach definitive conclusions. In particular, the financial structure of the deal remains a work in progress and there is very little available detail on the JV business plan,"" it notes. The statement is expected to delay the JV process, coming on the back of doubts expressed by American asset management fund Elliott Management Corp. In a recent letter addressed to Thyssenkrupp, Elliott highlighted the divergence in performance in Tata and Thyssenkrupp’s steel businesses and stressed that the German firm must seek a better deal. “This significant divergence in relative valuation should be adequately reflected in the final terms of the steel JV,"" Elliott wrote in the letter reported by German newspaper ‘Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung’. Thyssenkrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger had hoped for the JV to make significant progress by the end of this month. However, he still needs to convince the company’s supervisory board to sign off on the deal and the latest developments seem to have thrown the timelines further off-track. Tata Steel said it welcomed the European Works Council’s recognition of the industrial rationale for the proposed joint venture with Thyssenkrupp and the conclusion of this stage of their consultation process.A spokesperson said: “We believe in the business plan for the proposed joint venture and we are committed to delivering the joint venture without the need for compulsory redundancies. “We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our employee representatives throughout the process of creating the proposed joint venture."" The proposed JV between two of the world’s major steel companies would combine Thyssenkrupp’s and Tata Steel’s European steel operations to create Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after steel tycoon Lakshmi N. Mittal’s ArcelorMittal. Meanwhile, Tata Steel said it will continue to share information with the European Works Council about a recent announcement to sell its Cogent electrical steels business as part of a strategy to strengthen focus on strategic strip products and markets.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/JNPE2ZHNPxyweQWEW5jC6M/Tata-Steels-joint-venture-with-Thyssenkrupp-hits-delay.html
2018-09-25,"Tata Steel Ltd will pay  ₹ 4,300-4,700 crore to acquire the domestic long steel business of Usha Martin Ltd, which seeks to lower its stand-alone debt of  ₹ 3,484 crore. Usha Martin will now focus on its wire and wire ropes business.An insatiable appetite for acquisitions led Tata Steel to make its latest acquisition, despite the fact that the profitability of the Usha Martin unit is relatively low. Tata Steel will have a task on its hand to improve the performance of the steel business. Earlier this year, Tata Steel had picked up Bhushan Steel Ltd, and remains in the fray to acquire Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd.The price for the Usha Martin unit was not cheap either. Consider what JSW Steel Ltd, which gets most of its revenue from India, trades at—a market capitalization-to-sales ratio of 1.4 times its FY18 revenue. Its profitability is way ahead of Usha Martin. Even then, Tata Steel agreed to pay 1.3-1.4 times the company’s FY18 revenue.Now, Usha Martin comes with a one-million-tonne-per- annum long steel plant, very near Tata Steel’s Jamshedpur operations. It also has an iron ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants. This means that on the raw material front, other than working towards making the coal mine operational, there is little to be done that can lower costs.Usha Martin had said how rising costs of input, such as coking coal, had affected its revenue in FY18. Savings can be earned on procurement, logistics and marketing by being part of Tata Steel. But the gap in profitability is significant.In FY18, Tata Steel’s India business had a segment Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 26%, compared to Usha Martin’s steel business, which earned a segment margin of 2.9%. This improved in the June quarter, with Usha Martin’s profitability improving to 10.8%, but lower than Tata Steel’s 31.2%. That’s a wide gap in the profitability.Usha Martin’s revenue is relatively low at 5.6% of Tata Steel’s business and the overall impact will not be much. Still, Tata Steel will certainly like to improve its profitability. The company has, however, not said how it intends to achieve that. Tata Steel could improve utilization rates for now and later invest in capacity expansion and modernization. Since its own integrated steel operations are nearby, the company also has the option to bring operational changes or utilizing some of its raw material sources for its requirements.Tata Steel’s shares fell by 2.9% on Monday, but this was in line with the decline in steel stocks. The Usha Martin acquisition will not move the meter much, but at a time when its balance sheet is getting stretched by acquisitions, with more in the pipeline, investors would like to see how Tata Steel intends to make this acquisition work.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/kiSOgBmChlJXdg2NoVw8OP/Tata-Steel-is-not-willing-to-give-even-an-inch-on-the-acquis.html
2018-03-13,"So far this fiscal year, Tata Sons Ltd has received dividends worth Rs6,853 crore from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Besides, it tendered shares worth Rs10,278 crore in the IT services company’s buyback last June. But evidently, even these massive inflows of $2.6 billion aren’t enough to fill the holes created by the group’s non-performing assets such as telecom.So, for the first time in nearly a decade, Tata Sons has sold a stake in TCS to raise another $1.4 billion. Also, for the first time in more than a decade, it plans to raise $1.5 billion through an offshore syndicated loan, Bloomberg reported last week.A large part of these funds is likely to be used to clean up the mess created by Tata Teleservices Ltd. Tata Sons is honouring the implicit loan guarantees for loans taken by the telecom subsidiary, besides which it had to foot the tab for buying back NTT DoCoMo Inc.’s stake. The damage is expected to be around $5 billion, without including the write-down in the value of the group’s equity investments in the venture.One concern for TCS investors is if such requirements will keep coming up, necessitating future stake sales by its promoter.Now that the telecom misadventure has ended and with the troubled Corus acquisition in the process of being housed in a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG, the group has been showing a penchant for taking over other stressed assets. Tata Steel Ltd was reportedly the most aggressive bidder for assets of Bhushan Steel Ltd, and as some analysts see it, it is threatening a repeat of Corus. Besides, the group has said it will consider buying Air India with a view to gaining scale in the aviation industry.Investors worry that if these or some other projects backfire, the Tata group will fall back again on a TCS stake sale to get by.But if all goes well, and some of the proposed acquisitions create value, like Jaguar Land Rover did for Tata Motors Ltd, the decision to sell a small portion of the family silver would prove to be a masterstroke. After all, while TCS may be the proverbial goose that lays golden eggs, the flipside is that the Tata group’s exposure to this one company is at unhealthy levels. In FY17, dividend from TCS accounted for 92% of Tata Sons’ total dividend income and 86% of total revenue from operations. In that backdrop, selling down its stake in TCS and reinvesting the proceeds elsewhere is not a terrible idea. It’s also important to note here that TCS has been enjoying rich valuations lately, and the stake sale has been timed well. As pointed out earlier in this column, the TCS stock has been pricing in growth estimates that seem nearly impossible to achieve.Prima facie, the stake sale by the company’s promoter appears to support the view that returns may not be great from current levels. But as pointed out above, the Tata Sons management may have been guided by other factors— such as the need to raise funds to plug some holes and create new opportunities, as well as to de-risk the group from a disproportionately high exposure to TCS. Besides, the gains from the stake sale will help offset the write-off necessitated by the shutdown of the wireless business. It will spruce up Tata Sons’ profit and loss statement for FY18 and enable it to continue paying dividends. As such, TCS investors needn’t read too much into the timing of the sale.But the concern that this may not be the last of such sales may well be a valid one. TCS shareholders need to live with the risk of a sell down by its promoter to support the group’s other adventures and misadventures.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/xtGm6VlmMwHqWKiCm2ATjN/Why-is-Tata-Sons-selling-stake-in-the-goose-that-lays-golden.html
2018-11-26,"Mumbai: India’s two biggest private sector steel companies JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on steel giant ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter the country. In October, creditors of bankrupt Essar Steel India approved a  ₹ 50,000 crore joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for Essar Steel’s assets, paving the way for the first major foreign bets on steel manufacturing in India.Both JSW Steel and Tata Steel, during separate meetings with media on 13 November, said the entry of the global giant in India’s fast growing steel market would be good for competition.However, the companies said their customer relationships, array of value-added products and customisation would help them retain and grow market share and take on competition.“Obviously from Tata Steel point of view, we will continue to up the ante,"" T.V. Narendran, chief executive and managing director of Tata Steel said. “We have the technology and the product lines that are required.""ArcelorMittal’s entry into India comes at a time when Indian steel demand is growing at the fastest pace in the world. India is expected to overtake the United States in steel consumption in 2019 to become the second biggest market behind China, global steel body World Steel Association said in a report last month.ArcelorMittal plans to increase capacity of Essar Steel’s plant to 15 million tonnes from 10 million tonnes now, and produce higher grades of products. Owned by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal is the world’s biggest steel company with a total tonnage of 97.03 million tonnes in 2017.Analysts feel ArcelorMittal’s foray will force major Indian steelmakers to innovate, despite them downplaying the impact.“ArcelorMittal’s entry would spur a shift from steel capacity expansion to product/technology evolution by incumbents,"" said domestic broking firm Edelweiss in a report.Indian steelmakers say this is already in the works. “Each one of us in my view has enough space,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, said on 13 September, referring to India’s growing steel market.Rao said in-line with global trends JSW Steel had already started to move from “volumes to value"" to secure its profitability and market share in the future.JSW Steel is spending up to  ₹ 6,000 crore to expand its value-added offerings like automotive steel, electrical steel, and galvanised products by over 60% over the next three years, out of a total spend of  ₹ 4,500 crore on expansions.“We will completely transform JSW Steel...and also align the company in-line with what the market demands,"" he said.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/FcdvQ8UkZ81xnk46KrMtxI/Standard-Chartered-Bank-moves-NCLT-against-CoC-selecting-Arc.html

2018-02-12,"New Delhi: Shares of Tata Steel Ltd rose more than 5% in morning trade on Monday after the company reported a five-fold jump in its third quarter profit. Tata Steel had on Friday reported a five-fold rise in consolidated net profit to Rs1,135.92 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December. It had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs231.90 crore in the same quarter of last fiscal.Tata Steel shares closed 4.22% higher at Rs712.50 on BSE. In intraday trade, shares rose 5.2% to Rs718.

2018-06-12,"If Tata Steel Ltd’s shares are falling owing to fears its European joint venture has hit a roadblock, they may be overreacting. Both Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp remain keen on the idea of moving the European steel businesses off their books. The opposition from some Thyssenkrupp investors is on the structure. Even opposition from workers could be a negotiation tactic to get better terms. Since the final contours of the transaction are being worked out, there is time to make changes to keep both investors and employees happy.The most recent cloud on the deal comes from an activist investor. Elliott Management Corp. has asked Thyssenkrupp to negotiate a better deal, saying that Tata Steel’s performance has deteriorated since the deal was first proposed, according to a Bloomberg report.When the memorandum of understanding was signed in September 2017, both companies’ European steel business had a near identical Ebitda margin, with Thyssenkrupp’s at 10.1% and Tata Steel Europe at 9.5%. While Thyssenkrupp has maintained around those levels, Tata Steel Europe has dropped to around 7%.The latest four quarters show Tata Steel Europe’s Ebitda on a declining trend. Tata Steel Europe started FY18 with the first quarter Ebitda declining sequentially, which it attributed chiefly to higher coking coal prices negating the effect of higher product prices. The second quarter saw selling prices decline sequentially, even as costs increased and volume declined. The third quarter was a seasonally weak one due to planned shutdowns, but Ebitda stabilised as costs were lower. In the last quarter production recovered, which along with higher selling prices offset higher costs and Ebitda gained. Thyssenkrupp has said that its Ebitda benefited from higher selling prices but also from cost efficiency.This divergence in performance is why a few investors believe there is a case for better terms for Thyssenkrupp. Eventually, that depends on whether the underlying reasons are permanent or temporary in nature. Even while keeping the equity stake at 50%, the two companies can negotiate other terms in a manner that allows concessions for such divergences.Fortunately, the companies don’t seem to be having second thoughts about the transaction. Certainly, tough opposition from institutional investors cannot be ruled out, but even if they force a recast that is still better for Tata Steel than the deal falling through. Its acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd and likely acquisition of other distressed steel assets will increase the strain on its balance sheet. Moving the Europe steel business off its books not only makes its balance sheet healthier but should also improve profitability.Tata Steel shares were down 0.30% at Rs578 in early trade on Wednesday.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/lboDsKv3JnpqZuSX2GPiBL/Tata-Steel-Thyssenkrupp-JV-faces-investor-hurdle-but-is-not.html

2018-12-25,"New Delhi: Tasked with a key job of helping recover unpaid corporate loans, the NCLT has helped resolve insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings involving more than  ₹ 80,000 crore in the year passing-by and the kitty is expected to swell beyond  ₹ 1 trillion in 2019 with several big-ticket default cases pending.Plans are afoot to further strengthen the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by increasing number of judges and benches and provide adequate infrastructure to fast-track the process, according to government officials.The new year will not only test the mettle of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), but also of the NCLT and its appellate body NCLAT, as several high-profile cases need to be resolved—Essar Steel Ltd (involving over  ₹ 80,000 crore alone) and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (about  ₹ 45,000 crore due to its lenders) are just a few, experts said.In 2018, over  ₹ 80,000 crore was recovered from various corporate debtors, which had defaulted payments, under the IBC through various insolvency proceeding at the NCLT and the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal), Ministry of Corporate Affair Secretary Injeti Srinivas told PTI.As per estimates, the IBC has helped address stressed assets worth approximately  ₹ 3 trillion directly or indirectly—since the new law came into force in December 2016.“The estimated amount includes recoveries made through resolution plan and cases settled before admission by the NCLT,"" he added.In 2019, the NCLT is expected to finalise corporate insolvency resolution process of several stressed assets through its 11 functional benches across India. These cases would include Essar Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel, Videocon Group, Monnet Ispat Co. Ltd, Amtek Auto Ltd, Ruchi Soya Ltd, Lanco Infratech Ltd and Jaypee Infratech, among others.Acording to law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan executive partner Punit Dutt Tyagi, the new year is likely to “test the mettle of the IBC as well as of the NCLT and NCLAT"".“Most of the major cases pending before the NCLT are likely to be resolved and these debtors are likely to come into hands of successful bidders,"" he added.In 2018, insolvency proceedings against some companies including Bhushan Steel, Electrosteel Steel, Binani Cement were almost completed and the new management from their successful bidders—Tata Steel, Vedanta group and Adity Birla-led UltraTech Cement Ltd, respectively—have taken over the management control of the stressed assets.Big Corporate houses—including ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, UltraTech Cement, UK-based Liberty Group, Vedanta group, Dalmia Bharat group—were among the leading companies which had submitted their resolution plans to acquire the debt-ridden firms.Other major insolvency cases being handled by the NCLT and the NCLAT include RCom, Videocon group, Alok Industries, Lanco Infratech, Jaypee Infratech, Jyoti Structures and ABG Shipyard.Although, the IBC mandates completion of insolvency proceedings within 180 days of appointment of a resolution professional by the NCLT, with provision for a further extension of 90 days totalling to 270 days, several matters are running behind the schedule.“Although the 270-day deadline could not be met in a majority of the cases, the NCLTs and the NCLAT have largely delivered well-reasoned decisions. It is commendable since these tribunals are not just applying the settled law, but also interpreting new legislation such as the IBC,"" Tyagi said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has appeared in some major IBC cases including of Essar Steel, said there is a shortage of staff and the government should appoint more judges.“The NCLAT is managing well despite the odds. Judicially, they need many more members, at least double more. They are also hugely under-staffed. It’s more quantity (that is required), but quality of staff also needs serious up-gradation,"" Singhvi said.He also said the NCLAT premises are cramped and squeezed.The senior lawyer said a huge workload is difficult to handle with such severe infrastructure problems and these issues must be addressed immediately by the government.“There is no point in creating institutions and then crippling them,"" he added.According to Srinivas, there are around 10,000 cases pending before the NCLT and the NCLAT at different stages and most of the new cases coming at these quasi-judicial forums are from the insolvency side.“The government is focusing on these issues by increasing the number of members at NCLT and NCLAT. We would open more benches as per requirement and provide them more support in terns of trained staff, specially the young professionals and assistants, who would help the benches directly by doing research etc,"" Srinivas said.He further said, “We are putting a lot of emphasis on capacity building because these are all complex laws and new challenges keep coming. Whatever best capacity development can be done by holding seminars, conferences, all that has been done... We have tried to de-clog the NCLT."" In 2017, the RBI had issued its first list of 12 companies defaulting on loan payments and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against them. Later, a second list was also issued and these matters are given a high priority in the NCLT hearings.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/HivcqyYSmVjf6hZDIvY2KM/NCLT-helps-recover-Rs-80k-crore-in-2018-Kitty-may-cross-Rs.html

Mark Davies, works manager hot rolled products, said: “The system is designed to cool steel to very specific temperatures, depending on what it is to be used for, rather than waiting for it to cool naturally. This fine temperature control also allows us to more tightly control the mechanical properties and surface quality of steel used in specific and demanding applications."" The latest “capability upgrade"" is part of a series of investments to Tata Steel’s European operations designed to strengthen operations and long-term capability and allow the development and production of high-performing steels. “This will help meet the emerging need for next- generation steels for hybrid and electric cars, as well as for energy-efficient homes and buildings and innovative food packaging,"" Tata Steel said.In November 2017, the company had announced around £30 million pounds of investments, including the replacement of a basic oxygen steelmaking vessel—weighing 500 tonnes—at Port Talbot—Britain’s largest steelworks. At the same time, the company is replacing the massive cranes in the steel plant as well as installing enhanced dust extraction hoods and energy-efficient drives to minimise emissions. “This investment has created a stronger, more efficient and more reliable platform from which we can meet the needs of our customers. We took the opportunity of a planned maintenance shutdown to upgrade several plant areas to further improve production of high-value steels and their delivery to customers,"" said Jon Ferriman, Tata Steel’s director of strip products UK. Port Talbot produces high-quality steel which is processed at Tata Steel’s steel mills around the UK for manufacturers in Britain, mainland Europe and other countries around the world.

It had sold 3.21 mt in the domestic market in the same period last year, while the production stood at 3.20 mt. The company cited breakdown in the blast furnace at Kalinganagar plant as the main reason for lower production and sales, according to a statement released on Friday. Tata Steel Europe sales volumes were also lower at 2.48 mt in Q4FY18, compared with 2.85 mt in Q4FY17, while the production remained flat at 2.62 mt mainly due to unplanned outages, it said. However, the production and sales volumes of the company in South East Asia were stable on a quarter-on-quarter basis, according to the release. The company had earlier this month reported a 11% rise in domestic sales at 12.13 mt in financial year 2017-18, compared with 10.97 mt in FY17.

The three bidders for Bhushan Power—Tata Steel Ltd, Liberty House and JSW Steel Ltd—have been directed to “improve their financial offer"" by 13 August. In its last hearing, the appellate tribunal had set the deadline as 6 August.The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J.

2018-09-27,"Frankfurt: German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is considering a major overhaul which involves a separation of individual business units, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.The group which makes elevators, submarines, industrial plants and automotive components, has been under pressure to simplify its sprawling conglomerate structure, and could make a decision on the matter as soon as this week, the people said.No formal decision has been reached, and talks could still fall apart, the sources said.Shares in the group rose by more than 5 percent on the news to hit a seven-week high. Shares in Finland’s Kone, which has been considered a potential partner or suitor of Thyssenkrupp’s elevator business, also jumped on the news.Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.The group has been in crisis-mode ever since the sudden departure of both its Chief Executive and Chairman in July, bowing to pressure from shareholders that have long demanded a significant improvement in the group’s operating performance.Thyssenkrupp has in the past said it wants to focus on strengthening its capital goods business, which comprises elevators, car parts and plant engineering.Thyssen’s strategy evaluation comes as rival conglomerates including Siemens and General Electric are slimming down their businesses.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/IKByZNvKNUdI2M4wuZnMhL/Thyssenkrupp-mulls-separation-of-major-businesses-reports.html
2018-06-13,"Tata Steel Ltd’s shares are falling owing to fears that its European joint venture (JV) has hit a roadblock. They may be overreacting. Both Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp AG remain keen on the idea of moving the European steel businesses off their books. The opposition from some Thyssenkrupp investors, which may be causing concern, is on the structure of the deal. Even the opposition from workers could be a negotiation tactic to get better terms.Since the final contours of the transaction are being worked out, there is time to make changes to keep both investors and employees happy.The most recent cloud on the deal comes from an activist investor. Elliott Management Corp. has asked Thyssenkrupp to negotiate a better deal, saying that Tata Steel’s performance has deteriorated since the deal was first proposed, according to a Bloomberg report.When the memorandum of understanding was signed in September 2017, both companies’ European steel businesses had a near identical Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin, with Thyssenkrupp’s at 10.1% and Tata Steel Europe’s at 9.5%. While Thyssenkrupp’s profit margins have remained around those levels, Tata Steel Europe’s have dropped to around 7%.The last four quarters show Tata Steel Europe’s Ebitda on a declining trend. Tata Steel Europe started FY18 with the first quarter Ebitda decline sequentially, which it attributed chiefly to higher coking coal prices negating the effect of higher product prices. The second quarter saw selling prices decline sequentially, even as costs increased and volume declined. The third quarter was a seasonally weak one due to planned shutdowns, but here Ebitda stabilized as costs were lower. In the fourth quarter, production recovered, which along with higher selling prices offset higher costs and Ebitda gained. Thyssenkrupp has said that its Ebitda benefited from higher selling prices but also from cost efficiency.This divergence in performance is why a few investors believe there is a case for better terms for Thyssenkrupp. Eventually, that depends on whether the underlying reasons are permanent or temporary in nature. Even while keeping the equity stake at 50% the two companies can negotiate other terms in a manner that allows concessions for the divergence in performance.Fortunately, the companies don’t seem to be having second thoughts about the transaction. Certainly, tough opposition from institutional investors cannot be ruled out, but even if they force a recast that is still better for Tata Steel when compared to the deal falling through. Its acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd and the likely acquisition of other distressed steel assets will increase the strain on its balance sheet. Moving the Europe steel business off its books not only makes its balance sheet healthier, but should also improve profitability at the consolidated level.",https://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/VddPKSkzgsxTTA4VrJeVgP/Tata-Steel-Europe-JV-faces-investor-hurdle-but-it-is-not-a.html

The companies have already announced 4,000 job cuts as part of the tie-up.Although not essential to the creation of the planned joint venture, workers’ approval to the labour agreement is seen as key to getting the deal done and shows Thyssenkrupp’s commitment to seek workers’ consent for far-reaching structural changes.The joint venture still needs to be approved by Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board and chairman Ulrich Lehner could in theory use his casting vote to get the deal through should all labour representatives be against it.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/JH3sZebMgVsKvUjMXuP1eJ/Steel-workers-approve-ThyssenkruppTata-Steel-labour-deal.html
2018-03-21,"Mumbai: Lenders to Essar Steel Ltd have decided to reopen bidding for the debt-ridden steel maker after declaring ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius Ltd ineligible, said two people aware of the matter. The committee of creditors of Essar, which met on Wednesday, took this decision. Bidding will be open to all six companies which had submitted expressions of interest in Essar Steel in the first round of bidding, said these people. ArcelorMittal and Numetal can also bid provided they take “corrective action"". The tentative deadline for fresh bids is 2 April.On Wednesday, Essar’s committee of creditors cited section 29 (a) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code to reject ArcelorMittal’s and Numetal’s bids. The clause bars wilful defaulters, defaulters whose dues had been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) for more than a year, and all related entities of these firms from participating in the resolution process. The defaulters can become eligible for bidding if they pay up the amount outstanding. In ArcelorMittal’s case, the firm had a stake in Uttam Galva Steel Ltd,a delinquent borrower.“ArcelorMittal has sold off its stake in Uttam Galva Steels but the firm’s exit needs to reflect in the official documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India as well, which has not happened so far. Moreover, in the previous round of bidding ArcelorMittal was still holding stake in Uttam Galva which made it ineligible as well,"" said one of the people cited earlier.An ArcelorMittal spokesperson declined to comment.In Numetal’s case, one of its minority shareholders, Auro Enterprises, is owned by a trust that has Rewant Ruia, son of Essar Group’s co-founder as a beneficiary. The person cited earlier said that lenders have suggested that the Ruia-connected entity exit its holding in Numetal to become eligible for the next round of bidding. Numetal did not respond to an email seeking comment. Earlier on Wednesday, before the creditor panel arrived at its decision, Numetal filed a petition at the Ahmedabad NCLT to determine its eligibility as a resolution applicant. The firm said that the creditor panel decision would be subject to the order passed by the court. “Numetal’s application was necessitated as there is some apprehension that Numetal’s resolution plan may not be considered properly by the committee of creditors,"" Numetal said in a statement.

2018-04-06,"London/Mumbai/Frankfurt: Tata Steel Ltd would consider taking a majority stake in its planned European steel joint venture with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG after the business has publicly listed, according to two people familiar with the matter.Tata Steel’s willingness to increase its holding is a sign of its commitment to expanding its steel empire globally, said the people. This had been questioned by investors and analysts in recent years after the company, under former group chairman Cyrus Mistry, put its British steel assets up for sale following years of losses.Such a development in the planned joint venture, which would create Europe’s second-largest steel group after ArcelorMittal, would also fit with Thyssenkrupp’s strategy of reducing exposure to steelmaking to concentrate on manufacturing high-margin industrial and technology goods.“They have different visions. Thyssenkrupp is looking to exit the steel sector while Tata is looking to stay and grow,"" said one of the people mentioned earlier.Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.The two companies struck a preliminary deal last year to merge their European steel assets into the 50:50 joint venture. Investors widely expect a flotation of the business, something that both companies have said could happen.Tata Steel would “down the road be open to taking over a larger piece of the pie"" in the Thyssenkrupp tie-up once the merged entity is publicly listed, the second person said.This person added that this would depend on market conditions at the time of a listing and how well the company’s operations were in doing in India.Thyssenkrupp and Tata must retain a joint stake of at least 50.1% in the venture for at least six years following the deal’s closing in the event of an IPO, according to a labour agreement between Thyssenkrupp and its workers seen by Reuters.The deal does not specify how that stake should be split up, however, meaning Thyssenkrupp could in theory reduce its stake to, for example, 1%, if Tata Steel agreed to take on the other 49.1%.“We haven’t addressed at all the question of an end, of a minimum (stake),"" Thyssenkrupp chief financial officer Guido Kerkhoff told journalists in February when asked about whether both groups would equally divide the 50.1% stake.Global steel equity values have more than doubled since hitting 12-year lows in early 2016 at the depth of the steel sector crisis.Tata’s push to expand reflects a broader global trend towards consolidation of a fragmented steelmaking industry. The biggest players, including industry leader ArcelorMittal, China’s Hebei Iron and Steel Group (Hesteel) and India’s JSW Steel are looking to snap up assets across the world as the market rebounds.Patriarch powerThyssenkrupp, an industrial firm as opposed to a pure steel player like the others, has long been open about its desire to sell out of steel. Both the Tata tie-up and last year’s sale of its Brazilian steel mill CSA were done with a view to drastically lower Thyssenkrupp’s exposure to steel and transform the group into a technology and industrials powerhouse.Many investors have welcomed this strategy to slim down the sprawling industrial group to remove some of the conglomerate discount that they say weighs on the stock.For Tata Steel, by contrast, the joint venture is a move to save its ailing European steel business, which has been burning through about $1 billion of cash a year, by getting better economies of scale.Another major contrast between the two companies centres on ownership structure and corporate philosophy.Tata Steel’s holding company is Tata Sons Ltd, a $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate which is 65 percent owned by Tata Trusts - public charities that have a major say in group decisions and have historically favoured the good of all stakeholders over shareholder returns.In 2016, former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was ousted by family patriarch and Tata Trusts chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, in a dispute that involved competing corporate ethics and vision.The octogenarian Tata was acquisitive, legacy driven and an exponent of the traditional Tata Trusts view that companies exist to provide value and service to a community, making profits as a by-product of that process.Mistry, by contrast, was more focused on increasing shareholder returns, being nimble and cutting debt. He put Tata Steel’s British assets up for sale in 2016 and even considered closing down the business.Ratan Tata took issue with the move, even though the UK operation was losing £1 million ($1.4 million) a day at the time.Thyssenkrupp, too, is 21% owned by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, a philanthropic institution, but their stake is below the 25% threshold required to block important strategic decisions.

2018-04-19,"Nashik: Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG will take till the end of the year to set up its joint venture with Tata Steel UK Ltd, about six months later than it had earlier indicated, as negotiations between the steel makers and their workers are taking longer than estimated.In September 2017, Thyssenkrupp AG and Tata Steel UK had said that they would combine their steel making capacities in Europe into an equal joint venture. This would make their combined operations the second largest in the continent, after ArcelorMittal. However, talks with labour unions have taken longer than expected. “We’re still in discussions with the unions. After that, we will have to get approval from Europe’s competition authority. We expect the deal to close before December,"" said Jens Overrath, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel. The deal closure date has been pushed from March 2018 to June and now December. Thyssenkrupp’s labour union has asked for guarantees on jobs, plants and investment before they support the merger. While the support of the unions is not strictly necessary for the deal to go through, getting the workers on board will prevent labour strikes later. Overrath was in India to inaugurate the manufacture of cold-rolled grain-oriented (CRGO) electrical steel at the company’s Nashik plant. The plant, with a capacity of 35,000 tonnes of CRGO a year, is the first in India to produce such high grade steel. CRGO steel’s primary use is in transformers. The high-grade steel is designed to cut transmission losses for power distribution companies and make electricity more affordable for consumers. Indian demand for CRGO is at 400,000 tonnes currently, all of which is met by imports. Overrath said that 15% of Thyssenkrupp’s CRGO exports go to Asia, of which India is the biggest market. The Nashik plant will meet part of Indian and South Asian demand, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The plant can be expanded quickly to 50,000 tonnes a year capacity, if demand picks up, Overrath added.

2018-07-04,"Mumbai: The city bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has deferred its judgment on Cyrus Mistry-Tata Sons case to 9 July. The key allegation by Mistry camp is that his removal as chairman and subsequently as a director of the board Tata Sons was a result of oppression by the promoters who are in turn owned by Tata Trusts that owns over 68% in Tata Sons. The second part of the plea focused on the alleged mismanagement by Tata Sons board and Ratan Tata which caused revenue loss for the group. He has also termed the changes to the articles of association since his dismissal from office as “arbitrary"". Mistry’s family owns over 18% stake in Tata Sons, though holding with voting rights is only under 4%. The over 18% stake makes the Mistry group as the single largest shareholder in country’s largest corporate entity, though. The hearing on the case lasted for about four months (from October 2017 to February 2018). Mistry moved the NCLT in December 2016. The bench had dismissed his petition early 2017 citing eligibility clause, which was challenged at the NCLAT in New Delhi, which had asked the bench to hear the matter afresh.Mistry’s contention is that the articles of association of Tata Sons by structure are biased against the rights of minority shareholders and thereby oppressive, a charge that the Tatas dismissed saying he has been on the board since 2006 and had never mentioned this till he was shown the door on October 24, 2016. Mistry took over the reins of the salt-to-software giant in December 2012 after the group patriarch Ratan Tata demitted office on attaining 70 years. Ahead of the NCLT verdict on his petitions against the Tata Group, Mistry had last week fired a fresh salvo at the management. He has questioned the rationale behind some actions like the sale of its telecom arm to Airtel, massive debt-driven acquisitions by Tata Steel and its tie-up with Thyssenkrupp, among others. In a letter to the directors of Tata Sons, Cyrus Investments, which is the key investment vehicle of the Mistry family and the key petitioner in his legal feud with the Tatas, Mistry has sought accountability and information from the board of Tata Sons in which his family owns over 18% stake.With inputs from agencies",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/XSWlTw0l2ZF8vAqKCQ54pK/NCLT-verdict-on-Tata-Sons-Cyrus-Mistry-feud-today.html

2018-06-18,"Frankfurt/Dusseldorf: Thyssenkrupp AG’s top shareholders are skeptical about the company’s plan to combine European steel operations with Tata Steel Ltd, and have discussed voting against the proposal at a board meeting as early as next week, according to people familiar with the matter.The shareholders, which include Cevian Capital and the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Stiftung foundation, are pressuring management to improve the deal after a slump in profits at the Tata division made it less attractive for Thyssenkrupp. Even though management is working to negotiate changes, some shareholders are concerned that the tweaks will only look good on the surface and not be substantial enough, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.The discussions are ongoing, and it’s not clear how the investors will eventually vote. Talks over the final terms of the steel joint venture are entering a final stretch and the outcome will be decisive for Thyssenkrupp’s chief executive officer Heinrich Hiesinger, who has pegged the future of the company on the deal.Thyssenkrupp shares slipped 0.6% to 23.18 euros as of 9:18 am in Frankfurt. The stock is down 4.3% this year.While Thyssenkrupp doesn’t have to put the joint venture decision to a shareholder vote, the foundation, which has two representatives on the supervisory board, and Cevian, with one seat on the committee, can exert influence over the transaction. Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board is to meet as early as next week to vote on the deal. The board has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a fairness opinion, and Thyssenkrupp hired Rothschild & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG as advisers, said the people. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported the mandates earlier on Sunday.A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.Cevian, the second-largest shareholder, estimates the difference between the valuation for Tata and Thyssenkrupp at about 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion), the people said. Goldman Sachs, adviser for Thyssenkrupp’s management, has calculated the difference at less than 1 billion euros because it expects an uptick in profits at Tata’s European steel operations, according to the people.Separately, Thyssenkrupp CEO Hiesinger in an internal letter said the firm needs to quickly clinch a deal for a planned European steel joint venture with Tata Steel, adding that this was necessary to determine the group’s long-term strategy.“Therefore we are in close consultations with the supervisory board,"" Hiesinger wrote in a staff note dated 14 June, a day after the group’s supervisory board met to discuss the deal.Thyssenkrupp, under pressure from activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott as well as powerful unions, has less than two weeks to get the deal through its supervisory board in order to hit a self-imposed end-June deadline.Talks have dragged on for more than two years and hit a further snag over the valuation of European steel assets, which have performed differently for Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp since the initial deal was first announced in September.“The process is taking significantly longer than anticipated by us in the beginning,"" Hiesinger said in the staff note that was obtained by Reuters, adding the was aiming for a “constructive dialogue with all investors"".",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/UeSt5c66XGBRDFU569WrlN/Thyssenkrupp-shareholders-said-to-be-sceptical-of-Tata-Steel.html
2018-07-02,"Mumbai: Despite its apparent concessions, has Tata Steel actually come out on top in the joint venture agreement with German competitor Thyssenkrupp? Analysts believe that ultimately, Tata Steel’s concessions have been “modest"" and far below what the more vocal of Thyssenkrupp’s investors have been gunning for.Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies said in an analysis of the deal that the 5% lower economic interest that Tata Steel has agreed to at the time of a future IPO “implies $200-350 million of value shift in favour of Thyssenkrupp"" against the original 50:50 agreement on sharing IPO proceeds. This offsets only part of the total value shift in favour of Tata Steel that Jefferies had earlier estimated of $500-600 million.In fact, US-based activist investor Elliott Advisors has accused Thyssenkrupp’s management of offloading assets into the joint venture too cheaply. Elliott had submitted an estimate of the two companies’ fair valuations, demanding an 80% stake in the joint venture for Thyssenkrupp for its more profitable operations. Financial Times reported on 1 July that two members of the Thyssenkrupp board voted against the deal while one member abstained. The newspaper also reported that Swedish activist investor Cevian Capital had voiced concerns regarding the deal’s valuations.In a conference with journalists in Brussels on Monday, Heinrich Hiesinger, CEO, Thyssenkrupp, insisted that his company had received a fair valuation. “We believe that the 55:45 split in IPO proceeds and the synergies (that will accrue) from the joint venture are a fair representation of our valuation and will address concerns that were raised about the valuation gap.""Thyssenkrupp’s management has also been under pressure to present a strategy update to the board of “life after steel"" and to improve margins in its capital goods and elevator business – its new stated areas of focus – and disposal plans for its industrial solutions and material sciences verticals. Managements at both firms have said that Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV – the new company and a 50:50 joint venture between the groups—is expected to have €17 billion in sales and joint labour force of 48,000 workers. It will be the second largest steel player in Europe in the flat steel market after ArcelorMittal. Both companies have stated that the JV will help achieve annual synergies of 400-500 million euros, through joint purchasing including logistics services, higher equipment utilization and reduced administrative expense. If, in the future, Thyssenkrupp decides to take the JV public, the proceeds will be split 55:45 in the German partner’s favour. Speaking to Mint a few days earlier, Atanu Mukherjee, president of global metals and energy consultant MN Dastur & Co., said: “I think it’s a great move for Tata Steel in terms of improving its position after its acquisition of Corus in 2007. With this, assets are pooled in a way that maximises value for Tata Steel globally.""At Monday’s press conference, N. Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Steel, told journalists that his company remains committed to building steel in Europe over the long term. “The Tata group’s approach has been to find a solution for Europe (steel operations). The discussions with Thyssenkrupp took time and there were pension issues to be resolved. There was a certain environment that was needed to create a strong JV with a strong future. This is a good solution not only for shareholders but also for employees.""",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hmzgCIhBU0DrMdow7OKc3M/Tata-Steel-comes-out-on-top-in-Thyssenkrupp-JV-deal.html

2018-04-12,"Frankfurt/Duesseldorf:Thyssenkrupp on Thursday said that plans to set up a steel joint venture with India’s Tata Steel would suffer a delay, hampered by ongoing negotiations between Tata and its workers in Britain and the Netherlands.Boards at both companies were expected to decide on the venture by the end of June, Thyssenkrupp said, adding that the signing was planned to take place afterwards. The group had previously aimed to sign the deal in the beginning of 2018.Tata Steel is still due to deliver labour agreements with its staff at its Port Talbot plant in Britain and IJmuiden in the Netherlands.

The section deals with criteria to disqualify bidders.Earlier, lending banks had rejected the resolution plan submitted by Liberty House citing delay, following which the UK-based group had moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).The NCLT had on April 23 directed the lenders, led by Punjab National Bank, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House.

2018-07-17,"Frankfurt: After losing its top leadership in less than two weeks, it’s looking more likely that Thyssenkrupp AG could be headed for a breakup, although much rests on the next move of the company’s largest shareholder.Both the chief executive officer and chairman, opponents of splitting up the sprawling conglomerate into what some investors think would be more valuable parts, have resigned this month. Activist investors, including Cevian Capital, have pressured management to streamline the 207-year-old German company, which has operations in submarines, elevators and food packaging.JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the departure of chairman Ulrich Lehner and CEO Heinrich Hiesinger will fuel hopes that a restructuring can progress faster.Investors and analysts had urged Thyssenkrupp to sell off its material-trading unit or spin off its highly profitable elevator division. But Hiesinger and Lehner were long opposed to a breakup, saying collaboration across the company helped foster innovation.“Lehner had been one of the most vocal naysayers around a potential breakup, thus, if anything, this is likely to reinvigorate, rather than dampen, hopes that this will now be the course for Thyssenkrupp,"" wrote Bruna Haq, an analyst at JPMorgan.The shares rallied 8.6% to €22.37 as of 1:02pm in Frankfurt. The stock has declined 7.7% this year, valuing Thyssenkrupp at €13.7 billion ($16 billion).Thyssenkrupp has long been synonymous with Germany’s engineering and technological might. The company traces its origins to the steel dynasties of the Thyssen and Krupp families and its history is closely intertwined with Germany.The appointment of the next CEO or chairman could signal which direction the company is headed. Thyssenkrupp’s powerful labour unions, which control half the seats on the supervisory board, and its largest shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halback Foundation, have continued to argue for keeping the company together.Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Rochus Brauneiser said it was too early to tell what the impact of Lehner’s resignation would be, adding the key was in the hands of the foundation.Other analysts said the leadership turmoil increases the odds of a radical overhaul.“In my view, it makes a break-up more likely. Lehner had been very vocal in his opposition to major divestments,"" said Ingo Schachel, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.Lehner stepped down as chairman on Monday, saying he had lost the confidence of major shareholders and the board. Last week, Lehner gave an interview to Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper in which he blasted investor attempts to “destabilize"" the company with methods that resemble “psychological terror.""At a recent meeting to discuss the deal with Tata Steel Ltd., Lehner clashed with fellow board member Ursula Gather, head of the foundation, because she suggested the company mull other options and reconsider the terms of the steel joint venture, according to people familiar with the matter.Hiesinger, the previous CEO, unexpectedly quit on 5 July.

2018-04-03,"Mumbai: The ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV, and Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp. joint venture (JV) is open to working with the promoters of Essar Group to successfully implement the resolution plan for debt-ridden Essar Steel Ltd if required, two people close to the development told Mint on condition of anonymity. The two firms, which have submitted a combined bid for the beleaguered steel maker, have taken into consideration the dependability of other assets of the Essar Group which are crucial to its steel business but are outside the ambit of insolvency proceedings so far and continue to be controlled by the Ruias, the promoters of the group. Even as the spokespersons of Arcelor and Nippon declined to comment on the details of the resolution plan submitted by them on 2 April, they said that it takes care of all the “contentious issues"" that may arise in case they acquire Essar Steel. To be sure, Essar Steel uses the facilities of Essar Ports and Essar Power for supply of raw materials and power, respectively. While Essar Steel is undergoing resolution proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the power and port assets are outside the insolvency net. One of the issues that the potential acquirer may have to contend with is ensuring a steady supply of raw materials in case the facilities of Essar Ports and Essar Power are unavailable after the acquisition. Arcelor, however, stands confident in its pursuit of Essar Steel. “Those (unavailability of port and power assets) are also taken care of in our resolution plan. In some cases there are alternatives available and in some cases we may have to negotiate some solutions where the facility itself has no other purpose of being. We are confident we will find a solution. It certainly does not deter us from our interest in Essar,"" Brian Aranha, executive vice president (strategy, technology and R&D) at ArcelorMittal told Mint in an interview on Tuesday. On 8 November, Mint had reported that Tata Steel Ltd, one of the firms which had submitted an expression of interest for Essar Steel, had secured an informal commitment from the Adani Group for use of its port in Hazira, Gujarat, if it wins the bid for the bankrupt steelmaker, factoring the contingencies it may face due to unavailability of power and port assets of Essar. As on 31 March 2016, Essar Steel owed around Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, with State Bank of India being the lead bank. The other firms which submitted resolution plans in the second bidding round for the steel firm (which concluded on 2 April) included Vedanta Resources Plc and Numetal Mauritius along with JSW Steel Ltd. Commenting on the bid, Hideki Ogawa, managing director of Nippon Steel India, said that Arcelor-Nippon acquiring Essar Steel assets could bring in the highest foreign direct investment so far from Japan into India. “Looking at India, the size of the assets and the growth potential of these assets, Essar Steel was the best fit for us. The growth potential of the asset is very high considering India is expected to grow at a rate of about 7%.

2018-07-18,"Brussels: The European Union will launch measures on Thursday designed to prevent a surge of steel imports into the bloc following the US imposition of tariffs on incoming steel and aluminium, the EU’s official journal said.The European Commission has proposed a combination of a quota and a tariff to counter EU concerns that steel products no longer imported into the United States would instead flood European markets.The measures are the third part of the EU’s response to US tariffs. It has also imposed tariffs on €2.8 billion ($3.3 billion) of US imports, including bourbon and motor bikes, and has launched a legal challenge at the World Trade Organization. The quotas for 23 steel product categories have been set at the average of imports over the past three years, with a 25% tariff set for volumes exceeding those amounts. These quotas are allocated on a first come first serve basis.The main exporters of steel to the EU are China, India, Russia, South Korea, Turkey and Ukraine.The Commission said that the EU steel industry was “in a fragile situation and vulnerable to a further increase in imports"", with US tariffs reducing its capacity to sell there making them even more vulnerable.“In the absence of provisional safeguard measures, it is likely that the situation will develop into actual serious injury in the foreseeable future,"" the EU official journal said.European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement that the bloc was faced with no choice given the threat of serious harm to EU steelmakers and workers, but that EU markets would remain open with traditional trade flows.The Commission will continue its investigation, which was launched on March 26, until the end of the year. The provisional safeguards can be in place for up to 200 days.Imports of 28 products increased by 62% from 2013 to 2017, most noticeably in 2016 and with further rises this year. However, for five products, imports did not increase, leading the Commission to exclude them from its measures.For 12 steel product categories, imports from countries including China, Russia and Ukraine are already subject to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. The Commission said it would consider suspending or reducing them to avoid the imposition of “double duties"".EU manufacturers of the products ranging from hot and cold rolled sheets, plates, coated steel and tubes include ArcelorMittal, Voestalpine and Tata Steel.",https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4FII0TEuSgUpGesHtrFzNN/European-Union-to-curb-steel-imports-after-Trump-tariffs.html
2018-04-17,"Mumbai: Electrosteel Steels Ltd became the first of the 12 large loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to win court approval to exit bankruptcy.The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday cleared Vedanta Ltd’s Rs5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel, rejecting objections of an unsuccessful bidder, which had challenged the decision of the lenders on the ground that Vedanta was ineligible to bid for stressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).RBI had ordered lenders to refer Electrosteel to a bankruptcy court in June 2017, along with 11 other companies. Electrosteel, which is setting up a 2.5 million tonne steel plant near Bokaro, owes lenders Rs13,395 crore. The NCLT approved resolution plan for Electrosteel entails a more than 50% haircut for lenders, Mint reported on 31 March.The bench’s verdict should send a message to delinquent promoters that their companies could be taken away, said Rishav Banerjee, an insolvency practitioner and a lawyer who had moved the petition for State Bank of India (SBI), one of the biggest lenders to Electrosteel.However, a consultant who had advised SBI earlier on Electrosteel said “this is the best that lenders could have got from the derailed project"".One of the bidders, Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd had contended that one of Vedanta’s affiliates—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail. But based on semantics, the bench ruled that Vedanta was eligible to bid.Though lenders of Electrosteel had taken a stand that Konkola Copper Mines, a unit of Vedanta Resources, could not be described as a “connected"" entity under IBC, the bench ruled the opposite. But because only fines were imposed on the delinquent company, the bench said that Vedanta wasn’t barred from bidding for stressed assets.Renaissance Steel had alleged that Konkola Copper Mines had admitted to flouting Zambia’s environment laws several times, and that it was an offence punishable with three years in jail.Citing a judgement of the Supreme Court, the bench made a distinction between “imprisonment or fine"" and “imprisonment and fine"", ruling that fine as an option meant the company was guilty of a “less serious offence"" than what being convicted for an offence punishable with imprisonment alone would mean.“It appears to us that an offence punishable with imprisonment is different (from) an offence punishable with imprisonment or fine,"" the bench said in its order, adding that Konkola Copper Mines’ offence did not lead to Vedanta’s disqualification.It isn’t immediately known if Renaissance Steel will challenge the NCLT’s verdict. Its bid for Electrosteel Steels was at least Rs2,000 crore lower than Vedanta’s. Lawyers for Electrosteel declined to comment.Apart from Vedanta and Renaissance Steel, Tata Steel Ltd had also bid for Electrosteel Steels. Tata Steel’s bid was the second highest. In a separate petition, Renaissance Steel had alleged that Tata Steel, too, was ineligible to bid for stressed assets under IBC because its UK subsidiary was held guilty of criminal misconduct.Renaissance had alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd had flouted the UK Health and Safety at Work Act, and that the offence was punishable with imprisonment of two or more years.

The facility currently produces 3 mt of steel a year. The expansion is estimated to cost Rs23,500 crore and is expected to be concluded in 48 months, Tata Steel had said in a regulatory filing on 19 December.“Kalinganagar has shaped up well,"" Narendran said in Kolkata on Monday, adding the company was also pursuing growth opportunities through acquisition of existing capacities. The proposed expansion of the Kalinganagar unit will take Tata Steel’s total manufacturing capacity in India to 18 mt.The company currently sees “great opportunity"" to expand in India, and “we are well positioned because we have both organic and inorganic opportunities to grow"", Narendran said. Tata Steel has submitted bids for at least three stressed steelmakers: Bhushan Steel Ltd, Electrosteel Steels Ltd and Essar Steel India Ltd.“It is a great opportunity for anyone in the steel industry (with) the appetite and ambition to grow in India,"" Narendran said about the acquisition opportunities.

The proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance the group’s offshore obligations, Tata Steel said.The Union government’s investments in infrastructure will boost demand for steel, Narendran said. At the same time, investments into building transportation infrastructure such as roads and ports will reduce cost of despatching steel.

Renaissance Steel contends that one of the UK subsidiaries of Tata Steel had flouted the UK Health and Safety at Work Act, pursuant to which fines were imposed on it. Hence, it is ineligible under the IBC. An NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay issued notice to the resolution professional for Electrosteel and Tata Steel asking them to file their replies within seven days.The counsel for Tata Steel submitted that such a declaration would be “infructuous"" and “academic"" as Tata Steel is not the highest bidder for the debt ridden steel manufacturer. On 17 May, NCLAT had admitted Renaissance Steel’s appeal against the 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Kolkata bench approving Vedanta Ltd’s Rs5,320 crore resolution plan for the debt-riden Electrosteel.Renaissance Steel had contended that Vedanta was ineligible to bid under Section 29A of IBC as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail.The appeal would be heard along with the main appeal on 28 May.Earlier this month, NCLT’s principal bench had approved Tata Steel’s resolution plan for Bhushan Steel Ltd, rejecting objections with respect to its ineligibility.

2018-03-18,"On 12 March, iron ore prices fell to their lowest in 2018 so far, at $66/tonne for ore with 62% iron content delivered to Qingdao port, shows Bloomberg data. That’s a 9.5% decline from its level in early-January and prices have been declining recently, causing worry lines in the industry.China accounts for 49% of the world’s steel output. The price decline was driven by fears that steel demand from end-use industries such as construction could be weaker than expected. With steel and iron ore stockpiled before the Chinese New Year holidays, a longer wait to clear inventories hit prices.But on Wednesday, economic data from China showed a rebound in industrial output and fixed-asset investment, growing faster than expected in January and February, according to a Reuters report. Both steel and iron ore prices perked up as a result. Still, high steel output and stockpiles limited price gains, said the Reuters report.Also, restrictions on steel output to control pollution in winter months in China have ended, which should see steel output increase. This has a twin effect: higher steel output could weaken steel prices but higher demand for iron ore could lead to firm prices. Since iron ore prices tend to influence steel prices, the net effect remains to be seen.This interplay matters more for Indian steelmakers in the next few years, since we have become net exporters of steel. The month of February appears to indicate a change in trend, with exports declining by 8.3% over the previous year, according to Joint Plant Committee data. Finished steel output rose by 3.8% during the month but this was due to a 3.5% decline in Tata Steel Ltd’s output, probably explained by a shutdown at its Kalinganagar plant. Since this is temporary, steel output will increase subsequently and exports will pick up as well, since we will have surplus output.More importantly, February also saw a healthy increase in India’s steel consumption of 7.4%. Steel consumption growth has trended up in recent months. If it holds up, the domestic steel industry will be in a solid position, as domestic sales are more remunerative than exports.The main risk is a slippage in steel prices. That’s why China remains the big factor to watch for, although the US too has gained prominence this year with its 25% import tariff. Indian steel producers seem to be in a relatively good place. All they need is for global prices to remain steady, at the least; otherwise, a fall in prices can undo all the good that is being seen in the domestic market.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/vMYttzLgxkLwJaxeXvx4tJ/If-China-sneezes-Indian-steelmakers-may-catch-a-cold.html

2018-02-12,"London: Tata Steel Ltd will finance the repair of a blast furnace at Britain’s largest steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales, extending its life by seven years and soothing concerns about its commitment to Europe’s steel sector, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Tata Steel signed a preliminary deal last year to merge its European steel assets with those of Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG in a move driven chiefly by a need to address steelmaking overcapacity in Europe.Fully relining a blast furnace typically costs over £150 million (about Rs1,350 crore) and gives the furnace an additional 20 years of life approximately, while the repairs Tata Steel is looking at will cost about half of that, people in the know said.Tata Steel declined to comment.With earnings at the Port Talbot running at a fraction of those at Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp’s European assets and Britain’s exit from the European Union posing extra risks, the plant was seen as particularly vulnerable in the event of a downturn.But with Tata Steel looking to extend the life of one of its two Port Talbot blast furnaces and a new vision at the firm’s Indian parent following a top level management change last year, industry people say those concerns are receding.“We are nowhere near where we were two years ago,"" one industry person said, referring to the steel sector crisis of late 2015 in which Tata Steel attempted to sell its UK assets, including the Port Talbot plant which was losing £1 million a day at one point.Under the terms of a deal Tata Steel signed with British unions in late 2016, the company committed to no forced redundancies at Port Talbot and to keeping a two blast furnace operations at the plant until 2021.Given that the blast furnace Tata Steel is looking to repair—blast furnace five—was due to end its life in 2018-19, the company was obliged to do something to extend its life by another two years.Tata Steel is, however, going beyond that with more costly, long-term repairs. It is also investing more than the £100 million a year it committed to spend on its UK assets over the next decade under its deal with unions.Earlier this month, Tata said it had invested more than £14 million in one of its Port Talbot mills, in a move that would increase capacity by 150,000 tonnes per year. In November, it announced £30 million of investments in the plant.The Community Union, representing workers at Port Talbot, will continue to push for a full reline of blast furnace five, said Steve McCool, the union’s national officer.The global steel sector is emerging from a crisis in which global prices slid to 12-year lows in late 2015, resulting in plant closures, capacity reductions, and thousands of jobs cuts. Prices have since recovered some 60%, according to consultants MEPS.Tata Steel on Friday reported a five-fold increase in third-quarter profit, boosted by strong volume growth in India and rising steel prices.

2018-06-11,"Kolkata: Usha Martin Ltd on Monday said its board has approved a proposal to explore the sale of its steel business, marking a shift in strategy to revive the company. The company had earlier hired an investment banker to find a buyer for its wire rope business with the aim of paying down debts of around  ₹ 4,700 crore.In the light of the revived interest in steel assets, Usha Martin’s lenders are now of the view that it would be more expedient to sell the steel business, said a member of the board, who asked not to be identified. However, the company isn’t immediately halting the search for a buyer for its wire rope business, he added.Royal Bank of Canada was scouting for buyers for Usha Martin’s wire rope unit. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co. had advised the board on the proposed sale of the business.Rohit Nanda, chief financial officer of Usha Martin, said the aim is to reduce the company’s debt, and in view of the “improved scenario"" in steel, the board has decided that a potential sale of the steel business should be explored. The company will hire external advisers to “evaluate proposals and oversee the process"" to sell the division, Usha Martin said in a regulatory filing.On Monday, Usha Martin’s shares jumped 4.6% to  ₹ 29.50 on the BSE.The company’s board has always been of the view that wire rope is the core strength of Usha Martin, which is one of the global leaders in the business, said the unnamed director cited above. But until now, the board was sceptical about the chances of finding a buyer for the steel business, he added.It was earlier determined through consultation with McKinsey that if the wire rope business could be sold at an “optimal price"", the steel business could be nursed back to health by repaying debts with the sale proceeds, according to this person.But now, looking at the interest taken by leading steel makers such as Tata Steel Ltd and ArcelorMittal SA in distressed assets, the opposite is being explored, he added.Usha Martin’s steel division contributed  ₹ 3,421.19 crore, or 60.77% of the company’s revenue from operations of  ₹ 5,629.09 in fiscal 2017-18, without adjusting for internal sales between business divisions.

2018-12-10,"Mumbai: Metal stocks in India are feeling unloved by investors, with one exception: the country’s top steelmaker JSW Steel Ltd.While demand for metals has been accelerating as the South Asian nation plans major investments to overhaul its creaking infrastructure, shares of most producers have slumped this year. JSW Steel is the lone stock that’s set to end in the green in the 10-member S&P BSE Metal Index, which lost nearly a quarter of its value in 2018. The index is set for its first annual decline in three years, while the country’s benchmark index is edging toward its third year of gains.The Sajjan Jindal-led mill has risen about 12% this year. That compares with a 26% drop in rival Tata Steel Ltd and a 45% decline in state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL). Among base metal producers, Vedanta Ltd has lost 41%.A fall in global metal prices on trade tensions between the US and China amid higher raw material costs has weighed on the sector. China’s steelmakers are facing their biggest test in three years, as the intensifying trade standoff has added to the pressures on the economy—including the parts that consume most steel. Steel futures in China have fallen over 20% since reaching a seven-year high in August, while the LME Index has fallen about 16% this year, led by declines in zinc, lead and copper.Bright outlookStill, the outlook for India’s steel sector remains bright as the spreads between raw material prices and finished products haven’t fallen compared with other regions and domestic demand growth is expected to remain the highest in the world, Amit Dixit, an analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd., said a 3 December report.India is set to overtake the US as the world’s second-largest consumer of steel soon and demand is estimated to grow by 7% in the near- to medium-term driven by the government’s infrastructure spending. Copper usage is expected to accelerate by 10% this fiscal year, while aluminium consumption is estimated to rise 5%.JSW Steel remains the top pick among metal companies as other firms grapple with elevated debt, high employee costs and non-performing overseas assets, Bhavesh Chauhan, an analyst at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd, said by phone from Mumbai.“JSW in that sense has mainly domestic plants, which have very efficient processes, lowest conversion costs and its volume growth has always been better than others.""",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/8V23wD2qPTm9gavv0Z8XAI/JSW-Steel-emerges-as-lone-star-among-India-metal-stocks.html
2018-03-14,"London: A new pension fund backed by Tata Steel UK, a unit of India’s Tata Steel, will be set up after meeting minimum size and funding criteria, paving the way for the firm’s merger with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp.The trustee of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS), a 124,000 member final salary scheme from previous owner British Steel, said in a statement the new BSPS would go ahead on 28 March as planned.“This is very good news for the 83,000 members who wanted to receive their benefits from the New Scheme and chose to switch to it,"" said Alan Johnston, who will now act as chairman to the trustee of the new BSPS.Britain’s pensions regulator agreed a deal last year to allow Tata Steel UK to cut scheme benefits and set up a new BSPS in return for a £550 million one-off payment to the scheme.Tata Steel UK remains the formal backer of the new BSPS.Earlier this year, UK lawmakers said Britain’s markets watchdog was too slow to prevent “vulture"" financial advisers from ripping off steelworkers faced with critical decisions over their £14 billion ($19.6 billion) pension scheme.Some 25,000 scheme members failed to opt to transfer into the new scheme, meaning they end up in a lifeboat known as the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) by default, potentially a worse outcome for them.Alternatively, some of the 25,000 might have opted to transfer their pension into other investments, but many who took that option were encouraged by dubious financial advisers to sign up to risky, unsuitable investments.After Tata’s pension hurdle was overcome last year, Thyssenkrupp and Tata agreed to merge their European steel operations to create the continent’s No.2 steelmaker. The deal is expected to be finalised late this year. Reuters",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/fGxTAwuMaJ8lW9seF1gEeN/New-Tata-Steel-UK-pension-scheme-to-be-set-up-after-meeting.html

Mukhopadhyay also directed all parties concerned, including Tata Steel and L&T to submit its written responses by Friday.The appellate tribunal was also hearing Bhushan Energy promoters’ appeal challenging Tata Steel’s intention to terminate the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between it and its parent, Bhushan Steel.

The liquidation value of Bhushan Energy is expected to go down if the PPA is terminated.Singal had moved NCLAT questioning Tata Steel’s eligibility to bid for the company under section 29(A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), while L&T had moved the appellate tribunal seeking to be declared a secured creditor so that it gets higher priority in repayment of dues.Bhushan Power and Steel, which owes over  ₹ 48,500 crore to a consortium of lenders led by Punjab National Bank, is one of the 12 large companies identified by the Reserve Bank of India for early insolvency resolution. A recent report by credit rating agency Crisil pegged Bhushan Steel’s flat steel capacity at 5 million tonnes (mt) a year, about 9% of the Indian market.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/CNW0aPFK75X5O7Id7fGE6J/NCLAT-reserves-judgment-on-Bhushan-Steel-matter.html
