2018-07-04,"Reports suggest that RIL could well announce the commercial launch and prices for its broadband venture, JioFiber service. So what is JioFiber and how is it different from other broadband connections?   JioFiber is the latest offering from Jio for your home. It offers ultimate broadband experience to surf, stream, game and work, because of its ultra-fast upload and download speeds and effective functioning in merely “milli seconds”. JioFiber connectivity comes directly to your home unlike in most cases where the fiber reaches only until the building and the last few meters of end connectivity is done using the traditional cable which drastically reduces the speed and user experience due to patches and inferior cable qualities of such patch up. The current offer as listed on the Jio website is the JioFiber preview offer which gives you ultra high-speed internet up to 100Mbps for 90 days along with a monthly data quota of 100 GB and a complimentary access to a host of Jio's premium apps.  Highlights from March quarter results: Reliance Industries reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore for the March quarter, up 17 percent compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Consolidated quarterly revenues stood at Rs 1.29 lakh crore, up 39 percent quarter on quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 5 percent, QoQ, to Rs 18,469 crore, and the operating margin was 15.8 percent. Jio has continued its strong subscriber growth trend with net addition during the quarter of 26.5 million and its total count reached to 186 million. Higher competition has capped ARPU to Rs 137 which resulted in lower revenue of Rs 8,421 crore. Most brokerages have highlighted that the results have largely been in line with estimates, but have raised target prices up to Rs 1,200. Markets are expected to go up in anticipation of the conglomerate's retail IPO. Brokerages such as CLSA and Kotak Institutional Equities already ascribe an enterprise value of over ₹ 1 trillion for Reliance Retail, and valuations can be far higher on listing.

2018-10-16,"According to a Bloomberg poll of seven brokers, RIL's consolidated net sales is expected to come in at USD 1.41 trillion; net profit is estimated at USD 9,630.20 crore by 10 brokers.   During the July-September quarter, RIL had raised prices of its key petrochemical products to offset higher crude oil prices and counter the effect of a weakening rupee. Bulk chemicals traders, suppliers for RIL’s petrochemical products and analysts tracking the company said it raised prices by 10-21% in Q2 2018-19 while year-on-year increase is 17-61%. On the telecom front, Morgan Stanley expects Reliance Jio to have added about 35 million subscribers in Q2. Average revenue per user (ARPU) was seen declining by 2% quarter-on-quarter, leading to 13% quarterly revenue growth. “Some increase in opex (operating expenditure) could compress the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin, but we expect 10% quarter-on-quarter EBIDTA growth,"" said Morgan Stanley research in a report dated 9 October. EBIDTA is the measure of operating profit of a company. However, the refining business slowdown could continue, the gross refining margins have fallen a tad bit this time around to USD 10.2 per barrel versus USD 10.5 per barrel last quarter. On the petchem EBIDTA, last quarter it had hit a record high, the EBIDTA is expected to rise further by 8 percent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) to come in at Rs 8,490 crore, refining could see a bit of a downtick, so the EBIT could fall about one percent Q-o-Q, the retail business has been growing at a scorching pace, that pace is expected to continue and Rel Jio as well – subscriber additions will increase, so a revenue growth of around 12.5 percent is expected.

N Gopalaswami, who headed the panel to select the institutes, said, “We looked at the (Jio) proposal and it turned out to be fit for the tag.

2018-09-22,"The statement by the ministry came a day after French publication 'Mediapart' quoted Hollande as saying that the Indian government proposed Reliance Defence as the partner for French aerospace giant in the Rs 58,000 crore Rafale deal and France did not have a choice.   The Dassault Aviation has chosen Reliance Defence Ltd (RDL) as the Indian partner to fulfil offset obligations of the deal and both companies have already announced setting up of a joint venture to manufacture aerospace components. The opposition parties have been accusing the NDA government of favouring the RDL over state-run aerospace behemoth Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. The government has been maintaining that it has no role in selection of RDL by Dassault Aviation. ""The reported statement perhaps needs to be seen in its full context  where the French media has raised issues of conflict of interest involving persons close to the former President. His subsequent statements are also relevant in this regard,"" the ministry said, seen as a reference to a recent media report linking the Rafale deal with a film by Hollande's partner Julie Gayet. The report had said Ambani's Reliance Entertainment had signed an agreement with Gayet to produce a film before the Rafale deal was sealed. Hollande, who was France's president when procurement of 36 Rafale jets was announced in April 2015, rejected the report. ""Incidentally, media reports of February, 2012 suggest that Dassault Aviation, within two weeks of being declared the lowest bidder for procurement of 126 aircraft by the previous government, had entered into a pact for partnership with Reliance Industries in defence sector,"" the defence ministry said. The previous UPA government was negotiating with Dassault Aviation for procurement of 126 Rafale jets under which 18 jets were to supplied in a fly-away condition and 108 were to be manufactured in India by the French company along with HAL. However, the UPA could not seal the deal. In its statement, the defence ministry said the joint venture between RDL and Dassault Aviation is a ""purely commercial arrangement"" between two private companies. The joint venture came into force in February, 2017. It said the offset can be discharged by many means such as direct purchase of eligible products and services, FDI in joint ventures and investment towards equipment and transfer of technology. ""As per Defence Offset Guidelines, the foreign Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is free to select any Indian company as its offset partner."" Under India's offset policy, foreign defence entities are mandated to spend at least 30 per cent of the total contract value in India through procurement of components or setting up of research and development facilities. The ministry also referred to a press release issued by Dassault Aviation stating that the company has signed partnership agreement with several companies and is negotiating with hundred odd other companies.  ""As per the guidelines, the vendor is to provide the details of the offset partners either at the time of seeking offset credit or one year prior to discharge of offset obligation, which in this case will be due from 2020,"" said the ministry. The Congress has been accusing massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government when it was negotiating procurement of 126 Rafale jets.   .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/india/have-no-role-in-selection-of-anil-ambani-firm-for-rafale-deal-says-govt-after-francois-hollandes-claim-1885903.html

2018-07-29,"The broader NSE Nifty too hit a new high by rising 31 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 11,309.35.   Trading sentiment remained bullish backed by sustained capital inflows by foreign funds and widespread buying by retail investors, driven by strong earnings by some more bluechip companies that helped key indices to scale new peaks, brokers said. All eyes will be on Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meet to decide on its policy rates.  The Reserve Bank is likely to maintain status quo on the key interest rate on Wednesday notwithstanding elevated oil prices and government's announcement to steeply hike minimum support price for kharif crops, experts said. Reliance Industries rose by 0.94 per cent to quote at 1,140.25 after the company Friday reported its highest-ever quarterly net profit as bumper earnings from the retail business, improved profitability of telecom arm and near doubling of earnings from petrochemical business offset lower margins from oil refining business. Other gainers were SBI, ONGC, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, Coal India, Power Grid, Tata Motors, HUL, Tata Steel, TCS, Bharti Airtel, M&M, NTPC and Adani Ports, rising up to 3.24 per cent. PSU, oil & gas, banking, power, metal, Infrastructure, consumer durables and realty sector stocks were leading the rally. According to provisional exchange data, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) put in a net of Rs 738.05 crore and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth a net of Rs 406.12 crore on Friday. Asian stocks declined as markets took cues from declines in Wall Street's last session, with focus this week shifting to the Bank of Japan, which will declare its interest rate decision on Tuesday. Nikkei shed 0.75 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.66 per cent, while Shanghai Composite index fell by 0.16 per cent in early trade today. US stocks closed lower Friday, following disappointing results from Twitter Inc. and bellwethers, including Exxon and Intel. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee will embark on its two-day meeting on Tuesday, with the US central bank expected to announce its decision on Wednesday.   .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/sensex-hits-record-high-of-37496-nifty-above-11300-1827701.html

2018-12-19,"""Fundamentally, I am a big believer in the power of all of us together rather than a power of few. I think that will differentiate China and India in the long-run. My belief is that a decentralised empowered world where everybody being equal is better off than where few people are in power. That is true for data world,"" he said.   Ambani said the world will have to go from aggregator model to a distributor model as he backed those arguing for preventing foreign companies from repatriating and making money off of Indian consumers' data. ""Important thing is that data of an Indian belongs to him. It does not belong to a corporation, whether it be Indian or global. The only right that the corporation has is exactly like a bank that if I give you a fixed deposit locker and you put your money. which is your data in my locker, it doesn't become mine that I take that money and gamble on the stock market. If I make gain take it and then say I have given back your Rs 100. It doesn't work like that,"" he said. The RIL head also spoke about how digital technology had empowered people like nothing before in human history. He went on to speak about digital media vis-a-vis traditional mass media: ""Before digital, so-called mass media was for a passive audience. Social media's very name connotes that it belongs to society as a whole. I believe digital is the greatest friend to democracy."" ""Media in the digital age is of the people, for the people and by the people like nothing before."" Explaining his vision for the fourth industrial revolution and how India will be riding the change he said, ""Earlier, the world had witnessed 3 industrial revolutions. India only started playing catch-up in the third. The fourth industrial revolution is marked by a fusion of the technological physical and biological worlds. This is powered by data and will be defined by humanism"" He then put forth three reasons as to why India will lead the fourth industrial revolution. “India today is different from the India of yesteryears. It's a young nation. 63 percent of 1.3 billion are below 35. As a result, our nation is more vibrant than ever before. Each of 1.3 billion can actively participate in the 4th industrial revolution and solve problems,” he said. Ambani also addressed the five areas that India needs to focus on where he said that data will be the mainstay for the changing times ahead.  “India needs to prepare for the age of digital abundance. Indians will have access to all data on the cloud. Jio is geared towards connecting everything. India today is digitally united,” he said. The business tycoon then chose to focus on three areas specifically: agriculture, education and healthcare. Coming back to the fourth industrial revolution, he quoted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, ""India's contribution towards the fourth industrial Revolution will leave the world stunned"".

2018-07-31,"Leader of the Congress Mallikarjun Kharge and several others alleged that the ordinance was brought to facilitate the acquisition of Alok Industries by Reliance Industries.   ""People want the government to respond immediately and that is what is appreciated,"" he said, adding ""we want resolution and not liquidation"" of ailing companies. Goyal said all provisions of the bill were prospective and not retrospective to benefit any company and it was the NCLT, which in its wisdom, had decided to refer back the issue of acquisition to the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The minister said that he was not competent to discuss the conduct of the NCLT. The amendments propose to reduce the minimum voting threshold for the CoC to 66 per cent, from the existing 75 per cent for key decisions -- a provision which the opposition said was aimed at benefiting one corporate house. The bill also aims at giving relief to the homebuyers by recognising their status as financial creditors, thus giving them due representation in the CoC and making them an integral part of the decision-making process. Goyal said the government would come out with regulations and evaluation matrix which will help CoC to decide on insolvency issues. He said that under the previous regime of SARFAESI and BIFR, the resolution cost was 9 per cent and recovery was 25 per cent after taking into account 4-6 years. In the IBC regime, he said, the cost was less than one per cent and the recovery was over 55 per cent. Moreover, the changes brought about in the IBC were based on a parliamentary committee's recommendations. The minister also said that certain exceptions in the code have been made to help speedier resolution of stressed assets in the MSME sector. He assured the House that the government will not denationalise the public sector banks, while on the other hand, do everything to strengthen them. Kharge alleged that the ordinance was brought by the government to help the Reliance Industries to acquire Alok Industries. ""You brought this ordinance in haste. You do not respond with such alacrity during floods. The minister's reply is not proper. We protest and walk out,"" he said while leading the walkout. Earlier, several opposition members demanded that the bill may be referred to a Standing Committee. Participating in the debate on the measure, Congress member Veerappa Moily said the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had become ""an instrument for siphoning off funds"" of the treasury as banks were taking huge haircuts and corporates were buying out insolvent companies for paltry sums. ""Be fair and refer the bill to the Standing Committee. Because you got stuck up in the NCLT, you brought in the bill. The Ordinance is tainted and sending it to the Standing Committee will remove the taint,"" he said, adding that the ""greed"" behind bringing the bill is to ""loot the banks"". Moily, a former Corporate Affairs Minister, said if the bill was referred to the Standing Committee, then it would submit its report within 15 days. Moily is now the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance. N K Premachandran (RSP) said the promulgation of the IBC (Amendment) Ordinace was a ""clear case of crony capitalism"", saying it intended to benefit a particulate industrial house. ""Alok Industries owed Rs 30,000 crores to banks, Reliance Industries bought it in Rs 5000 crore, banks loss was Rs 25000 crore,"" he asserted, while alleging that undue haste was shown by the government in bringing the bill. Questioning the government's urgency in bringing the IBC Ordinance when the Monsoon Session was just a month away, P Venugopal (AIADMK) said a perception was being built that the government has brought in the amendment bill to facilitate one corporate house. ""The IBC is being amended in haste to allow Reliance Industries to take over Alok Industries.... In the name of NPA clean-up, the government should not be seen as supporting crony capitalism,"" Venugopal said. Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government was leading the country to a 'blind alley' and the IBC should not be seen as a panacea for all illness. ""Mr Goyal, our caretaker Finance Minister, we can't see the banking sector collapse... I support the Congress demand of referring the bill to the Standing Committee,"" Ray said. He said under the resolution process, banks were taking huge haircuts and the IBC is leading to ""crony capitalism"". Citing the resolution process of the Alok Industries, Ray said the Reliance Industries could not acquire the company at the first instance since the resolution plan got less than the required 75 per cent vote. ""The IBC amendment bill brought by the government lowers the minimum vote requirement for passing the resolution to 66 per cent from 75 per cent in the original act. Just for 66 per cent vote, you can acquire a company. Just for Reliance Industries, Government has brought an Ordinance,"" Ray said. The TMC member said in case of Bhushan Steel takeover by Tata Steel, the banks had taken 40 per cent haircut and lost Rs 21,000 crore. In case of Vedanta buying Electrosteel, the haircut was 60 per cent and the banks lost Rs 8,400 crore. As regards Alok Industries, banks have taken a 83 per cent haircut and the loss is to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore, he claimed in the House. The other members who participated in the debate included Subhash Baheria (BJP), P S Chandumajra (SAD), J P Narayan (RJD) and Dushyant Chaoutala (INLD). .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/ibc-ordinance-was-not-to-favour-any-corporate-house-piyush-goyal-1829849.html

2018-07-05,"Oh look, #Whatsapp on #KaiOS! Looking forward to going 🍌s! https://t.co/Av6gW3T2M0— Juho Sarvikas (@sarvikas) July 5, 2018  The Nokia 8110 4G was announced back at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018 in Barcelona alongside the Nokia 8 Sirocco, Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 6 (2018). HMD Global has now come up with a 4G version of the Nokia 8110. With the launch, the company aimed to bring back the age-old trend of 'slider phones'. However far-fetched that idea might have sounded at the time, the new Nokia 8110 does look appealing on many fronts. The phone supports Google apps like Google Assistant, Google Search and Google Maps. It even has a re-worked version of the classic Snake game. However, HMD Global had said that the banana phone does not support WhatsApp.  Only time will tell as to when the Nokia 8110 4G would come to India, however, WhatsApp and YouTube should soon be a part of the banana phone’s repertoire. When it comes to specifications, the Nokia 8110 4G has a 2.45-inch QVGA (240x320 pixels) display. It draws power from a 1.1GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 205 SoC, coupled with 512MB of LPDDR3 RAM. The handset has a 2-megapixel rear camera sensor with an LED flash. It has 4GB onboard storage and measures it at 133.45x49.3x14.9mm. On the connectivity front, the phone has 4G VoLTE with hotspot functionality, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.1, GPS/ A-GPS, Micro-USB, FM radio, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Nokia’s banana phone comes with a 1500mAh battery that is said to deliver up to 9.32 hours of talk time on VoLTE and 25 days of standby time on LTE.

2018-10-17,"Venezuela's oil production is at a 60-year low after years of underinvestment.   ""We continue to get (Venezuelan oil) but I would say it is lower,"" Srikanth said. ""Iranian supplies are zero. Therefore we have had to look at alternatives like... Middle Eastern crudes, and we are also taking some U.S. grades."" The company's decision to stop buying Iranian oil from October-November came after an advisory from its insurers, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in May. Reliance imported 2 million barrels of Iranian oil in September, ship tracking data obtained from sources showed. Its two advanced plants at Jamnagar in western Gujarat state can together process 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and have the capability to turn cheaper, dirtier crudes into high-value refined products. Reliance on Wednesday reported a record quarterly profit in the July to September period. ""Our integrated refining and petrochemicals business generated strong cash flows,"" chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a statement. However, its gross refining margin for the three months through September, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, fell to $9.50 per barrel, a 3-1/2 year low. Reliance said higher oil prices, a narrowing price spread between light and heavy crude and weaker light distillate cracks during the quarter had affected its refining and marketing business. Reliance had also declared force majeure on gasoline exports from its Jamnagar site in August due to a technical glitch at a fluid catalytic cracker. The company's exports of refined products during the September quarter totalled 10.1 million tonnes compared to 11.2 million tonnes a year earlier. Srikanth said the government's recent order to state-owned fuel retailers to cut marketing margins by Re 1 a litre will not affect his firm's plan to ramp up its network of retail fuel stations. The company has 1,325 fuel stations. The price of gasoil and gasoline sold through that network is on a par with that of state fuel retailers, Srikanth said.​  Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd, which owns Jio, is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd. .update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.update_date{font-size:12px;color:#666;display:block;text-align:left}.update_date strong{font-weight:700}.related-storybox{padding:10px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin:14px 0}.related-storybox h2{font-size:20px;padding-bottom:6px;color:#222}.related-storybox ul{display:flex;justify-content:space-between}.related-storybox ul li{background:#f0f0f0;margin-right:10px;flex:1;padding:10px;box-sizing:border-box;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.related-storybox ul li:last-child{margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul li a{color:#222}.related-storybox ul li img{float:left;padding-right:10px}@media(max-width:600px){.related-storybox ul li{flex-basis:100%;margin-bottom:10px;height:92px;margin-right:0}.related-storybox ul{display:block}} .video-sicon{top:25px;}ul.opinion-listing{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; display:flex; margin-bottom:10px; justify-content:space-between}ul.opinion-listing li{border-bottom: 0; max-width:216px; width:100%; font-size:15px; padding:15px 0 12px; position:relative; line-height:22px; font-weight:bold}ul.opinion-listing li a{color:#282828}.alsowatch{font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding-top:10px; color:#444; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:4px;}ul.opinion-listing li .vodeoiconb{width:35px; height:35px; background-size:35px; top:25px; left:170px}",https://www.news18.com/news/business/reliance-industries-halts-iranian-oil-imports-ahead-of-us-sanctions-1912687.html

The exit of smaller players (most recently Aircel) could be cushioning the blow for incumbents -- but that is a cushion that may not last for long,"" it said. The survey suggested that these trends, however, do indicate that JioPhone is a product that has passed the early adopter stage and is getting well accepted, and that should be a reason for worry for the incumbents. ""Sooner than later, it could start eating into installed subscriber base of incumbents. Going forward, the potential release of KaiOS version of Whatsapp could be an added catalyst for sales of this device,"" it noted. The report pointed out that it would be interesting to see Jio's experience of data usage on these devices. It said Jio consistently saw around 10 GB per month usage per sub in the smartphone segment. ""We would be surprised if feature phone users match up to that level of consumption,"" the survey added.

2018-07-05,"Speaking at the AGM on Thursday morning, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said an optical fiber based fixed-line broadband is the future, it offers hundreds of megabits per second of data speeds and will allow RIL to offer smart home solutions besides also creating value for small merchants.   Analysts welcomed this move since the broadband market right now is “under penetrated” and RJio’s arrival will shake things up, for sure. The devil, however, will be in the pricing detail though the service will start rolling out from August 15.  In a note to clients, brokerage Morgan Stanley said broadband penetration in India is just 7% (of which fibre penetration is less than 0.5%) of households, compared to 85% in China as of December 2017. This presents unmatched opportunity to RJio. “We think rising data usage with growing digital content presents a significant opportunity for broadband players in the space. Our industry discussions indicate 20% of the households are ready to consume fibre offerings and this is expected to grow to 35% of households over the next 3-5 years. For top FTTH providers, average ARPU (Average Revenue per user) is Rs 650 per month. RJio plans to launch FTTH services over next few months and has initiated beta trials in a few locations. It has rolled out 400K RKm of fibre and is expanding the footprint. In addition, it intends to enter the enterprise segment with connectivity as well as business solutions around the same,” the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Analysts at brokerage Motilal Oswal said that RJio’s focus is currently on FTTH but it would later shift to enterprise business. RJio has 270,000 sites, broadband coverage will require 1-2 years for completion and Jio has more than 10 petabytes capacity already which is expected to double in two years. Competitor Bharti Airtel has 30% of its sites fiberised, has five petabytes capacity and is expected to reach just seven petabytes in a year. What RJio is vying for is the market where fiber connectivity reaches your doorstep and that of merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises across 1,100 cities. For the home. This means ultra HD entertainment, multi-party video conferencing, voice activated virtual assistants, digital shopping. Then devices like security cameras, home appliances, even lights and switches, can be securely controlled by using a smartphone from both inside and outside the home. Such connectivity could also redefine 24X7 emergency help at home for the ill. For merchants and small businesses this means much better customer servicing and competition with large businesses. Whether RJio succeeds in the FTTH business like it has succeeded in the mobile telephony business will depend on tariffs and the amount of investment it is willing to sink in to make it work. It will surely disrupt the market, where significant players like Hathaway, DEN Networks, Airtel and Dish TV currently operate. Meanwhile the existing mobile telephony business of RJio has also reported robust growth. Remember, despite being in the business for less than 24 months, RJio already accounts for a fifth of the mobile telephony market revenue share in the March quarter of 2017-18. In one year, customer base has doubled to over 215 million; data usage has almost doubled too, to 240 crore GBs per month while voice usage has more than doubled to 530 crore minutes per day. RJio is already number one operator in 5 circles in terms of revenue, these circles contribute 17% of its revenue and 12% of industry revenue. The 13 circles, where RJio is second, contribute almost two-thirds to industry revenue. The launch of the next gen JioPhone at affordable rates, announced on Thursday, would likely accelerate the jump from feature phones to smart phones for a large section of the population and in the process, surely help RJio’s finances further.

2018-07-04,"In signs of succession planning at India’s largest private firm, billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s twin scions Isha and Akash were on October 11, 2014 appointed as directors on board of Reliance Industries’ telecom and retail ventures.   Isha and Akash, 27, were appointed to the boards of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. The next generation of the Ambani family — Isha, Akash and Anant — took centre stage at a function attended by 50,000 people, comprising Reliance Industries’ employees and their family members. “The future of Reliance belongs to you,”chairman Mukesh Ambani told the younger generation of Reliance in his keynote speech at a big celebration marking 40 years of the company’s listing and the birth anniversary of its founder Dhirubhai Ambani on 28 December, 2017, founder’s day for the conglomerate.  Isha, who graduated from Yale University with majors in psychology and South Asian studies in 2013, worked with global consultancy firm McKinsey in US briefly.  Akash, who graduated from Brown University with a degree in Economics, had been working closely with Ambani family confidant Manoj Modi on RIL’s 4G telecom venture.  The two joined around the same age as their father Mukesh, who was 24 years old when he joined RIL in 1981.  While the Ambani scions have been seen at company’s annual general meetings, Akash possibly made his first appearance on a company’s business deal when RIL in 2011 signed an agreement in London to sell 30 percent stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, including the producing KG-D6 fields to BP plc for $7.2 billion. Isha was first brought to the world's notice as a 16-year-old, when Forbes ranked her number two in a list of the world’s youngest billionaire heiresses.  Nita Ambani Although she is best known as the woman who turned around the Mumbai Indians cricket franchise, Nita plays a larger role in RIL than is widely perceived. When brothers Mukesh and Anil were involved in a bitter fight for the Reliance empire, it was said that one of Anil's grouses was that Nita, Anand Jain and Manoj Modi mattered more in the company than him. Nita played a key role in RIL's decision in 2010 to buy 14.8% in East India Hotels, where she is now on the board of the company along with Manoj Modi. She has also been involved in RIL's retail operations. Nita made her mark as part of the team that built the Jamnagar refinery, particularly her initiative to transform the arid zone into a green belt with mango plantations. She is also the founder-chairperson of the Dhirubhai Ambani International School and is actively involved in the Reliance Foundation. A gracious host, Nita throws lavish parties at the new Ambani residence, Antillia, where politicians, cricketers and Bollywood stars rub shoulders.

2018-07-04,"The scheme offers direct fiber connectivity all the way to the house, unlike traditional fiber networks that offer connectivity to the house via traditional cables leading to slow speeds.   At present it offers connections with 1.1 tera byte free data at a speed of 100 mbps. This is provided for nothing but a refundable security deposit of Rs 4500 for GigaHub Home Gateway service. The move is seen as an attempt by the industry giant to further expand its operations across various sectors, particularly telecom, reports suggest. The company had made this intention pretty clear in 2016, when Ambani said that investment in the telecom startup Jio would be around Rs 2,50,000 crore. Also various reports have indicated that the Reliance Group would probably invest around Rs 60,000 crore this year alone into the telecom unit likely to support the launch of the broadband plan. And with Jio likely to enter the sector, it would be interesting how it will affect the broadband market in the country and how competitors will respond to it.

2018-02-20,"“How can India’s most populous state also become India’s most prosperous state? The answer is simple -- by embracing the Digital India Mission. Which is why, Reliance has built a world-class digital infrastructure all over India, including UP, in less than two years. Jio has already created 40,000 direct and indirect jobs in Uttar Pradesh and is now ready to increase the opportunities,” the Reliance Industries chairman said during the inaugural session of the Uttar Pradesh Investors’ Summit 2018.   Among other announcements, he said that Jio will provide over two crore phones in UP on a priority as the state is “special to their group”. “Jio is providing highest data at lowest rates to the two-crore consumers of Uttar Pradesh. By the end of December 2018, Jio will be present in all the villages of Uttar Pradesh,” Ambani said. He further said that for river Ganga and Namami Gange projects, the group will contribute in every possible way. Meanwhile, Adani group Chairman Gautam Adani made some major announcements. “The Adani group will build six lakh tons of storage capacity in the state along with investment in multi model- logistics parks. Also, Adani group will be coming up with 1,000 MW of solar project and a solar park of 5,000 MW capacity. The Adani group will be investing Rs 35,000 crores in the state in the next five years along with setting up a world class multi disciplinary university,” he said.

2018-10-04,"The gauge had lost nearly 550 points in the previous session Wednesday.   The NSE Nifty index too fell 213.15 points, or 1.96 per cent, to 10,645.10. Volatility index India VIX also surged 6 per cent.  All sectoral indices were trading in the red, with IT, auto, pharma, banking and realty stocks witnessing most losses. Top laggards include Reliance Industries, Hero MotoCorp, TCS, IndusInd Bank, Adani Ports, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, Asian Paints, HDFC and Bajaj Auto, falling up to 6 per cent. While, Yes Bank was the top gainer, rising up to 2.18 per cent. According to analysts, the equity benchmark indices have fallen nearly 10 per cent from peak levels attained in August, led by weak domestic sentiments, global uncertainties, depreciating rupee and strengthening crude oil prices.   With rupee and crude oil showing no signs of stability, weakness is likely to continue in the coming sessions, they said.  Brokers said volatility was seen in most Asian markets as high US yield and good economic data led to fear that investors would move to the US, dampened trading sentiments here.  Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were trading sharply lower by falling up to 2 per cent.
