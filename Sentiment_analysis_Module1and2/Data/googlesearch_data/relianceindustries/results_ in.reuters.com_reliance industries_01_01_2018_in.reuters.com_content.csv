2018-09-21,"NEW DELHI/PARIS (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced calls for his resignation over allegations of corruption in a military jet deal with France after former French president Francois Hollande was quoted as saying New Delhi had influenced the choice of a local partner. Indian political parties have been gunning for Modi over the 2016 purchase of 36 Rafale planes from Dassault Aviation estimated to be worth $8.7 billion, saying he had overpaid for the planes and had not been transparent.  In recent months, the opposition has questioned the government on the choice of billionaire businessman Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence as Dassault’s local partner instead of a state-run manufacturer with decades of experience. On Friday, Hollande, who cleared the intergovernmental deal when he was in office, was quoted as saying New Delhi had put pressure on Dassault to choose Reliance.  “We had no choice. We took the interlocutor that was given to us,” he was reported as telling the French news service Mediapart, fuelling a political storm in India. Under Indian defence procurement rules, a foreign firm must invest at least 30 percent of the contract in India to help it build up its manufacturing base and wean off imports.  For that, the French firm picked Reliance and not Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the state-run giant that has been producing planes for decades, most of them Russian under licence.  “The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors. Thanks to François Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to ...Anil Ambani,” Rahul Gandhi, the president of the main opposition Congress party, said in a tweet. “The PM has betrayed India.” Modi, who stormed to power in 2014 promising to rid India of deep-seated corruption, had no “moral right” to remain in power after the revelations from Hollande, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said.  Smaller parties also joined the attack on Modi who is already under pressure to shore up his political base ahead of a series of state elections this year followed by a national election in 2019. Modi’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The defence ministry said in a tweet that neither the French nor Indian government had had a say in the matter. “The report referring to fmr French president Mr. Hollande’s statement that GoI (government of India) insisted upon a particular firm as offset partner for the Dassault Aviation in Rafale is being verified. “It is reiterated that neither GoI nor French Govt had any say in the commercial decision.” Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dassault denied the report, saying it had picked Reliance as a partner for industrial reasons. “This is Dassault Aviation’s choice, as (Dassault) CEO Eric Trappier explained in an interview published in MINT newspaper on April 17,” the company, which also makes Falcon business planes, said in a statement. “Dassault Aviation and Reliance have built a plant in Nagpur for manufacturing parts for Falcon and Rafale aircraft. The Nagpur site was chosen because of the availability of land with direct access to an airport runway, an essential condition (for) aeronautic activities.” The French foreign ministry published a statement saying French authorities were not involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners in the Rafale deal. “The French government is in no way involved in the choice of the Indian industrial partners which have been, are or will be, chosen by French companies,” the statement said. “In accordance with the Indian procedure, French companies have full freedom to choose the Indian industrial partners they consider to be most pertinent and then to propose to the Indian government for approval the offset projects they want to carry out in India with local partners to respect their obligations,” it added. The deal with Dassault was expected to deepen strategic ties with France and the company itself has hoped it would lead to a larger order for combat jets that the Indian air force says it needs to face a perceived twin threat from China and Pakistan. India picked the Rafale plane to replace its ageing fleet of Russian aircraft from a field that included Lockheed Martin’s F-16, Saab’s Gripen, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Russian MiG-35.

2018-10-17,"(Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd reported a record quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by growth in its core petrochemicals business and helped by rising revenues at budding telecoms unit Jio. The telecoms unit is central to the ambition of Chairman Mukesh Ambani - Asia’s richest man - to make Reliance’s consumer businesses as big as its energy operations, which currently contribute the bulk of group revenues and profits. Jio marked a fourth straight quarter of profit in June-September, of 6.81 billion rupees ($93 million), compared with a loss in the same period last year. Reliance, which in August became the first Indian company to reach a market value of 8 trillion rupees, said group consolidated profit rose more than 17 percent in June-September to 95.16 billion rupees. That was just shy of a forecast 95.67 billion rupees by 11 analysts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. The group’s businesses include refining, petrochemicals, retail and telecommunications. On Wednesday it said it would also invest in cable television and digital cable distribution companies to widen its sphere of business. It will pay 20.45 billion rupees for primary investment in DEN Networks Ltd and 29.40 billion rupees for a stake in Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd.  Reliance said its EBIT for petrochemicals rose nearly 64 percent in June-September, the second quarter of its financial year, from a year earlier to 81.20 billion rupees. Its gross refining margin for the three months through September, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, was $9.5 per barrel, Reliance said in a statement.

2018-08-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries has declared force majeure on gasoline exports from its Jamnagar site, four people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, causing the profit margin from producing the fuel to jump to its highest since September.  The force majeure follows an unspecified issue at a gasoline-producing fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) unit in its  export-oriented refinery, two of the people said. That plant can process more than 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and is located in Jamnagar’s special economic zone.  Reliance filed a statement to the National Stock Exchange of India stating it has shut one of its FCC units and that the unit is expected to restart within two weeks.  It added that the rest of the Jamnagar complex is operating normally and it does not expect the shutdown to have any material impact on overall operations.  The filing did not say what caused the FCC to shut or comment on the force majeure of gasoline supplies. Force majeure is typically declared when matters deemed beyond a refinery’s control disrupt supplies, allowing it to void some of its contractual obligations to customers.  Reliance operates one other refinery in Jamnagar, located in western India, that mainly meets domestic demand.     The people said at least two gasoline cargoes scheduled for this month’s loading from Reliance were affected, one of which was destined for Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. The people declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media.     According to ship tracking data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, four gasoline cargoes were scheduled to load from Sikka on to ships chartered by Vitol, Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), Oman Trading International and Royal Dutch Shell since Aug. 10.  Two of the four vessels have been anchored at the port since Aug. 13 while the other ships are either en route or at a nearby port.  The force majeure on gasoline supplies was declared this week and this could last at least eight days, one of the four people said. It was not immediately clear what the issue at the FCC was, but it is expected to be resolved soon, another source said.      “This will have quite an impact on the (Asian) gasoline market,” said a Singapore-based trader, adding that the market was already reacting to talk of trouble at Reliance’s gasoline-making unit even before it declared force majeure. Reliance offered a heavy naphtha cargo for export last month, which traders took as a sign its gasoline-making unit could be hit by glitches. Heavy naphtha is a feedstock for gasoline or paraxylene and Reliance does not usually offer the grade.  Asia’s gasoline crack, which measures the profit margin from refining a barrel of Brent crude into the fuel, rose by 30 percent from Tuesday to $11.55 a barrel, the highest since Sept. 20.

2018-07-04,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries, which has upended India’s telecoms sector with its cheap mobile data plans, launched its fiber broadband system on Thursday in a push to make deeper inroads into the country’s wireless and fixed-line internet industry. Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, said the company will begin registrations for its fiber-to-home service from Aug. 15, India’s Independence Day. “India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband ... Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband,” Ambani told shareholders at the oil-to-telecoms giant’s 41st annual general meeting (AGM). Jio, Reliance’s telecoms venture, is a key plank of Ambani’s long-term vision to make consumer-facing businesses as big as the company’s core oil-and-gas business that currently accounts for 90 percent of its revenues. Since its launch in 2016, Jio has roiled India’s telecoms sector by offering free calls and cut-price data plans, forcing rivals such as Bharti Airtel to respond with price cuts of their own and spurring consolidation.  Jio now has 215 million subscribers and is on track to cover 99 percent of the country, Ambani said. Reliance’s new fiber network, JioGigaFiber, will be rolled out in 1,100 cities and will potentially connect 50 million homes, enabling consumers to use smart solutions such as real-time surveillance and connected devices, Ambani said, without giving any pricing plans. Shares in rival Indian firms that offer home broadband services fell after Reliance unveiled JioGigaFiber. DEN Networks closed down about 10 percent, while Hathway Cable and Datacom ended about 15 percent lower. The plan to launch fiber broadband opens up a new revenue stream for Reliance under its Jio venture. The company has already invested around $36 billion in its telecoms initiative. While Ambani reiterated the company’s focus on high-margin petrochemicals business, local brokerage Sharekhan, which is owned by BNP Paribas, hailed the JioGigaFiber launch as “a step in (the) right direction”. Reliance has been testing its broadband service in some cities, offering what it says is faster internet connectivity than regular broadband where speed is less as the fiber reaches only up to the building and not directly into homes. The company has also been betting on acquiring content to fuel data consumption in a country of over a billion mobile subscribers. It has invested in Eros, Indian production house Balaji Telefilms and music app Saavn. Billionaire Ambani said the company was targeting 100 million users for its internet-enabled JioPhone that now also supports Facebook, WhatsApp messenger and YouTube. Reliance last year launched the JioPhone, which allowed digital payments and was effectively free: buyers could get a device for a refundable fee of 1,500 rupees. The Mumbai-headquartered company said a JioPhone 2 worth at 2,999 rupees ($43.50) will be available from Aug. 15. Reliance, which runs several grocery, electronics and fashion stores across India as well as an online fashion portal, plans to digitize its retail network using Jio’s network. Reliance shares have surged nearly 83 percent since Sept. 1, 2016, the day its telecom service was launched. Jio turned a profit within a year of its operation. “From here onwards, it will depend on the profitability of Jio,” said a fund manager, whose mutual fund owns Reliance shares. “That will either make or break the stock.” Reliance shares closed 2.6 percent lower in a broader Mumbai market that ended down 0.19 percent.

2018-05-18,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Reliance Communications said it was in advanced talks with Ericsson to resolve “commercial issues”, after two sources indicated it was currently uncertain if the firms’ discussions over dues would lead to an out-of-court settlement. Earlier this week, India’s bankruptcy court admitted a plea by the Swedish telecom gearmaker seeking insolvency resolution against debt-laden Reliance Communications (RCom) over unpaid service dues, potentially derailing the company’s plans to sell assets to larger rival Reliance Jio.  Ericsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom’s nationwide telecoms network, is seeking 11.55 billion rupees ($170 million) from RCom and two of its subsidiaries. “We confirm that RCom and Ericsson are at an advanced stage of discussions to expeditiously resolve commercial issues,” the company said in a securities filing on Friday, adding a resolution would enable it to exit the bankruptcy court process. RCom is also confident of “expeditiously” proceeding on its asset sale deal agreed with Jio and the overall debt resolution plan agreed with its creditor banks, it said in the statement. One of the two sources who spoke to Reuters earlier on Friday said RCom had approached Ericsson, but with a lack of clarity around payment of dues “a settlement currently looks uncertain”. The two sources, who asked not to be named as the talks are private, said Ericsson could withdraw its plea if an out-of-court understanding is reached.  Ericsson said it does not comment on speculation. Shares in RCom, controlled by wealthy businessman Anil Ambani, had soared 30 percent on reports of settlement talks with Ericsson, but reversed gains to trade down 2.7 percent by 0920 GMT. The Mumbai market was down 0.7 percent. With debt totalling 457.33 billion rupees ($6.73 billion) at end-March 2017, RCom is the most-leveraged of all listed telecoms carriers in India. To raise funds, RCom announced plans late last year to sell most of its wireless assets to mobile carrier Reliance Jio in a deal sources said was worth about $3.8 billion.

2018-07-27,"(Reuters) - Reliance Industries Ltd’s telecom unit Jio reported a third straight quarterly net profit, as its cut-price plans continued to bring in more customers. The results vindicate the long-term vision of Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, to make the Indian conglomerate’s consumer businesses as big as its core oil-and-gas division that currently accounts for more than 90 percent of revenues and profits.  Jio has shaken up India’s telecoms sector since its launch in 2016 by offering free calls and cut-price data plans, forcing rivals to respond with their own cuts and spurring consolidation. Jio, which turned a profit within a year of its launch, recently flagged an upgrade of its feature phone and said it aims to have 100 million users as quickly as possible. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, or Jio, posted a profit of 6.12 billion rupees ($89.15 million) in the quarter ended June 30, versus 5.10 billion rupees in the previous quarter. Jio’s profitability is being closely watched by investors in Reliance. Reliance Industries’ profit on a standalone basis - which includes the Indian oil-to-retail conglomerate’s refining, petrochemicals and oil and gas exploration and production businesses - was 88.20 billion rupees versus 81.96 billion a year ago. The standalone number excludes retail and telecom operations. That compared with an average estimate of 86.43 billion rupees from 10 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Standalone revenue for the conglomerate rose 35.5 percent from a year ago to 954.72 billion rupees. Gross refining margin, the profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, was $10.50 for the quarter, outperforming the benchmark Singapore complex margins which averaged $6 per barrel, the company said. On a consolidated basis, which also includes Reliance Industries’ U.S. shale gas, retail, telecom and other operations, net profit came in at 94.59 billion rupees over the quarter, the company said in a statement on Friday.

2018-06-07,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries Ltd aims to make its consumer businesses as big as its core energy operations, chairman Mukesh Ambani said in its annual report, as he seeks to reshape the industrial powerhouse. The company, primarily an oil and gas refining, marketing and petrochemicals conglomerate, counts telecoms, retail and media and entertainment as part of its consumer businesses that together contribute barely a tenth of total operating profit. However, buoyed by the success of Reliance’s fledgling telecoms start-up Jio, which turned a profit within a year of operation, Ambani is hoping to see rapid growth from the consumer divisions in future. “Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade,” Ambani said in a letter to shareholders in the annual report. “The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold, wherefrom they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits,” he said. In May, Reliance announced that Jio posted its second straight quarterly net profit since its launch in September 2016 as its cut-price plans continued to attract subscribers. With more than 186 million subscribers, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, or Jio as it is commonly called, is the fourth biggest telecoms carrier in India and boasts of having added more customers in the 2017 fiscal year than its rivals combined. Jio triggered a price war among operators as they moved to  compete with Jio’s low-cost data plans, driving down margins and spurring consolidation in India’s telecom industry. It plans to cover 99 percent of the country with its network by the end of the year, giving it reach to households and enterprises, Jio’s head of strategy Anshuman Thakur said in May. Ambani, India’s richest man, spearheaded the company’s consumer-led diversification a decade ago with its entry into organised retail. While that business turned an operating profit within six years, its contribution to overall profit remains minimal. The retail business accounted for 4 percent of the company’s consolidated net profit in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Reliance runs the world’s largest single-location crude oil refinery and petrochemical complex, in western India. That contributes 90 percent of the company’s overall profit and revenue.

2018-10-29,"SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries, currently India’s second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market. Reliance’s refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when India’s oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world’s third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country’s retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations. This push into the domestic fuel market may stumble after India’s government imposed cost controls on Oct. 4 on petrol and diesel prices to rein in recent record highs. Reliance’s shares plunged 6.9 percent on the day of the announcement and are down about 20 percent since their record close on Aug. 28. The decline has pushed Reliance’s market capitalization down to 6.64 trillion rupees ($90.47 billion) and it is no longer India’s most valuable company, sitting behind Tata Consultancy Services Ltd at 6.77 trillion rupees. GRAPHIC: Oil price change in U.S.-dollar vs Indian rupee png    The price shock, driven by soaring crude import costs, angered consumers and triggered riots by farmers, forcing the government to react at the cost of its refiners’ health. For now, Reliance is staying with its retail plans despite the recent trouble. “When prices are cut, you have to effectively match it,” said Venkatachari Srikanth, Reliance’s joint chief financial officer, during their earnings presentation on Oct. 17. “We are not going to let this alter broadly our strategy on retail petroleum.” In line with that, Reliance is planning as many as 2,000 retail stations with oil major BP Plc over the next three years, local media reported on Tuesday. Reliance’s domestic push made sense in an Asian fuel market that is increasingly crowded with new refinery capacity from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China. The new capacity, combined with soaring crude prices, has eroded profit margins for producing refined fuels. With the domestic market now also under pressure from price controls, some analysts have been spooked. Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian oil consultancy Trifecta said the government move could “be disastrous for Reliance.” The retail move puts Reliance into competition against government controlled refiners like Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil Corp, the country’s biggest refiner. Reliance’s domestic strategy initially won the backing of investors and the retail fuels group was touted by company Chairman Mukesh Ambani in a speech at its annual general meeting in July. Between January and August, Reliance’s shares soared 45 percent, far outpacing the state-owned refiners as well as India’s main stock index, the Nifty 50, which gained 12.5 percent. But rising crude prices, which jumped from under $70 per barrel in early 2018 to around $85 in early October, and a tumbling rupee combined to push domestic fuel prices to records, undermining Reliance’s retail strategy despite some relief from a dip in crude prices in recent weeks. Still, Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president of India’s BOB Capital Markets, which has a buy rating on Reliance, said signs of an “oil price shock” in India were “already visible.” Reliance may gradually mothball its retail stations because of the cost controls, said Macquarie Capital Ltd Analyst Aditya Suresh in a note on Oct. 5, though the bank expects no meaningful impact on its earnings. Reliance may be better placed to thrive on exports despite the increasing competition in Asia and the Middle East. The company operates the world’s biggest refinery complex at the port of Jamnagar in Gujarat. The first Jamnagar plant can process 663,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude while the second site can process another 709,000 bpd. Reliance’s refining margins last quarter were at a premium of $3.40 per barrel over the average Singapore margin, the benchmark for Asia. However, the Singapore margin has dropped by about 50 percent since mid-2017 because of rising crude prices. Reliance also said in its results that fewer refinery outages last quarter meant global run rates were high. Still, Reliance’s refineries benefit from being among the most modern in the world.  Several units process residual fuel oil, the leftovers after crude oil is initially refined, into higher-value petrol and distillate products as well as remove pollutants such as sulphur.  That ability to cut its high-sulphur fuel oil output to nearly nothing while maximising its diesel fuel output gives Reliance an advantage as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require new low-sulphur fuel oil used in ships starting in 2020. “IMO regulations are positive because of our mid-distillate configuration,” said Reliance’s Srikanth. With a move towards cleaner fuels as part of IMO, BOB Capital’s Ahuja said Reliance’s gross refining margins could rise by up to $5 per barrel.   Beyond IMO 2020 and the Indian fuel price turmoil, the oil industry is threatened by the rise of electric vehicles and alternative fuels that could reduce oil’s use as a transport fuel. Refiners are looking at petrochemicals to replace potentially lost demand in the transport sector. “If I have to look at it from a ‘oil demand hit from electric vehicles’ perspective, it’s going to be petrochemicals that’s going to survive for them (Reliance) beyond ten years,” said Ahuja. Combined, Reliance’s refining and marketing group along with its petrochemicals division contribute more than 90 percent of the overall company revenues, its latest annual report showed. Under Reliance’s “Oil to Chemicals Journey” strategy the company is seeking to “upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals” over the next decade. “We are focusing to produce and sell at every level,” said Reliance’s Srikanth. “Between whether to sell domestically or on bulk, whether we will export, every day is an analysis of which is a better option.” ($1 = 73.393 Indian rupees) Reporting by Koustav Samanta in SINGAPORE and Promit Muhkerjee in NEW DELHI; Writing by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://in.reuters.com/article/reliance-india/after-years-of-global-success-reliance-industries-faces-oil-shock-at-home-idINKCN1N30SQ
2018-09-25,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - India will continue to depend on oil as a mainstay of its energy but its oil demand growth will likely slow as the government pushes for cleaner energy and renewables, Harish Mehta, President, Refining & Marketing at Reliance Industries said on Tuesday. India is pushing for intervention to support renewables, grid electrification, and the government is trying popularize natural gas and shared mobility, said Mehta said during the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore.  “This will lower down the growth of oil consumption (in India) over the next decades,” he said. However, oil consumption will still increase to 480 million tonnes by 2040 as the renewable push will not completely halt oil demand growth, he said, citing official statistics. To meet that consumption, India has been boosting its overall refining capacity with first production from its upcoming West Coast refinery expected in 2022. India has plans to add 190 million tonnes per year of refining capacity over the next 10 years to its existing 228 million tonnes per years, he said.  “Over a period of time, some additional refining capacity would also come and some of the exports which are happening through the private sector will probably get curtailed and would get consumed in the country itself,” he said. Mehta said he is optimistic about the possibilities in the Indian retail fuel sector because of a conducive regulatory environment in the country at the moment.

2018-10-12,"JAIPUR, India (Reuters) - On a hot morning in India’s tourist mecca of Jaipur, an open truck painted in the signature lime-green colours of Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging service pulls into a dusty lane, where five men spill out and begin to perform a skit.     The event is part of a major grassroots effort by WhatsApp to battle fake news, which has triggered numerous lynchings in a country where 200 million people use the service, more than anywhere else in the world. The actors soon draw a crowd as the play unveils how spreading misinformation online can stir up mob violence, especially in the countryside, where caste and religious prejudices run deep. “Our society is better than theirs and that’s why you should hate them,” says one, citing one example of an incendiary text circulating on WhatsApp in India. “If you are truly one of us, spread this message.”    Such texts, pictures and videos aim to sow discord, warns another, as the viewers in the capital of India’s western desert state of Rajasthan are then told how to identify forwarded messages and use WhatsApp responsibly. The drive follows intense government pressure for both Facebook and WhatsApp to fight fake news and rumour-mongering that have led to more than 30 deaths in about 70 lynching attempts since Jan. 2017, data portal IndiaSpend says. The campaign is not entirely altruistic. It is being run in conjunction with Reliance Jio, the fast-growing telecom carrier controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani that recently made WhatsApp available on its $20 JioPhone. Instructions on how to install and use the app on the JioPhone, which has connected tens of millions of low-income Indians to the Internet for the first time, are also a part of the 10-city roadshow. Hundreds of people from WhatsApp and Jio are helping drive the campaign, with some WhatsApp employees having flown in from California, a WhatsApp spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, adding that the company did not reveal financial details. A source familiar with the matter said the costs were mostly being paid by WhatsApp. WhatsApp’s efforts to battle fake news in India include a limit on forwarded messages in a market where more users pass around messages, photographs and videos than any other. It has launched newspaper and radio campaigns and tied up with Delhi-based non-profit Digital Empowerment Foundation to develop a digital literacy curriculum for India. The company is also training police and law enforcement officials to use WhatsApp in helping them do their jobs.      “Our goal is to drive one of the largest coordinated public education efforts on misinformation to date anywhere in the world,” WhatsApp said. India’s technology minister has demanded the company do more, including working out how to trace the origin of “sinister” messages. But WhatsApp says it will not take such steps, which would require it to weaken encryption and other privacy protections.    It is not clear how much the public information campaigns will change people’s behaviour. But in Jaipur, at least some of the messages seem to be getting through. “I learnt how to quit a WhatsApp group created by strangers,” said Bhawani Singh Rathore, a 35-year-old teacher, who began using the service just months ago and attended. “And I also learned how to identify a forwarded message and to not send it ahead without checking its accuracy,” he told Reuters.

BP has a tie-up with Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, to enter India’s downstream sector, including natural gas marketing and retail fuel sales. “I think that price controls are a kind of thing that will not be good for the sector in the longer term,” Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP, said at the India Energy Forum organised by IHS CERA. He did not comment on when BP would open its first fuel retail outlet in India in partnership with Reliance. India cut taxes on diesel and gasoline this month and asked state companies, which account for the bulk of retail fuel sales in the country, to reduce the price of the two sensitive auto-fuels by one rupees on every litre of fuel sold. The move was widely seen as government intervention in local fuel pricing, although Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said the step should not be seen as going back to a regulated regime. The government has since said it would not interfere with market-determined prices of gasoline and diesel. “I have not heard any suggestions that India will go back to price controls. There have been some reductions on parts of the taxes,” Dudley told reporters in New Delhi on Monday.  BP, which has tied up with Reliance to explore gas fields in India, expects to have a 10 percent gas market share by 2022, Dudley said, adding he expected BP India’s gas production with Reliance to be 1 billion cubic feet per day in five years. He said he was hopeful that over that timeframe the company would have large retailing partnerships with Reliance and a strong presence in India’s solar market.  In 2011, BP paid $7.2 billion to buy a 30 percent stake in Reliance’s fields and promised an additional $1.8 billion for future performance payments. However, both companies held off from announcing any major investments in the field as the local natural gas price did not support a sufficient return on investment. The government allowed higher prices from deepwater natural gas reserves from October 2014.  Dudley said the low natural gas price in India before 2014 was a major factor that slowed down its investments in the country. Last year, Reliance and BP announced an investment of $6 billion to develop three fields in the east coast of India which would add around 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas between 2020 and 2022. “We plan for the long term and we’re here in India for the long term,” Dudley said on Monday, referring to BP’s plans for India.

2018-10-19,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Shares in Reliance Industries dropped as much as 7 percent on Friday, the first trading session after it reported record second-quarter results, weighed down by the company’s heavy debt and a delay in a key refining project. The refining-to-telecom conglomerate posted on Wednesday a record consolidated quarterly profit of 95.16 billion rupees ($1.3 billion), driven by growth in its core petrochemicals division and consumer businesses of telecom and retail. Indian markets were closed for a holiday on Thursday, but shares in Reliance took a hit on Friday with some investors concerned by the company’s debt load and the delay in its $5 billion petcoke gasifier project. “We think the earnings momentum will remain strong, but a material improvement in credit metrics is still less likely as telco capex is likely to remain elevated,” international broking firm JP Morgan said in a report. During an analyst meeting, the company admitted to the delay at its western Indian refinery.  Analysts have been counting on the project upgrade, which could boost Reliance’s gross refining margins from next quarter.  The company also indicated continued capital expenditure in the ensuing quarters to roll out its ambitious fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) service under its telecom venture Jio. A delay in the gasifier project served as an indication of the pressure on refining earnings in the forthcoming quarters, several analysts said. Shares in Reliance were down 4.4 percent, as of 0856 GMT, while the broader Mumbai market was down 1.61 percent.

2018-12-14,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court rejected petitions on Friday seeking an investigation of fighter jet deal worth about $8.7 billion with France’s Dassault Aviation, handing a political victory to the ruling party months before a general election. The ruling is a setback for the opposition Congress party, which had accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government of corruption in the deal to buy 36 Rafale planes and a decision to pick Reliance Defence as a domestic partner. Reliance, owned by billionaire Anil Ambani, has no aeronautical expertise and was chosen ahead of state-run Hindustan Aeronautics, which has a history of making planes. Dassault said in October it picked Reliance as a partner on its own, countering a French online media report that said the Indian government insisted on the firm as a condition of the contract. The petitioners, two former ministers of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and an activist lawyer, had argued that the escalating price of the deal should be investigated. “We don’t find any material to show that it’s commercial favouritism,” Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said in delivering the court’s ruling. “It’s not proper for the court to examine each aspect of this case. It isn’t a job of the court to compare pricing details,” he said. Congress used the issue to put pressure on Modi in recent state elections and ahead of a general election due by May. The BJP lost power in three heartland rural states in results announced this week. The government and Reliance have said the charges are baseless. Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma told reporters the party did not agree with the court ruling and demanded a parliamentary investigation into what he called an “arbitrary deal”. Finance Minister Arjun Jaitley, the BJP government’s chief trouble-shooter, rejected the demand from Congress saying any investigation by a political body would be “partisan”. Several other BJP ministers and leaders took to Twitter to attack Congress, accusing it of politicising a deal the government says is critical for India’s defence. They also demanded an apology from Congress President Rahul Gandhi. “Truth always triumphs!” BJP President Amit Shah tweeted. “The court’s judgment on the Rafale deal exposes the campaign of misinformation spearheaded by the Congress president for political gains,” he said. Ambani said the ruling showed “the complete falsity of the wild, baseless and politically-motivated allegations levelled against Reliance Group and me personally”.

2018-04-24,"(Reuters) - Bharti Airtel Ltd posted its lowest quarterly profit in nearly 15 years on Tuesday, as a price war in the telecoms sector continued to hurt, while revenue was hit by a regulatory cut in international termination charges. The entry of Reliance Jio, the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, into India’s telecoms sector has set off a brutal price war among operators as they drastically cut prices to compete with Jio’s bottomed out plans. Compounding to the industry’s woes, India’s telecoms regulator had also cut international termination charges (ITC) - paid by global long-distance operators to local carriers - to 30 paise from 53 paise, effective from February.  “The telecom industry continues to witness below cost, artificially suppressed pricing,” Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel’s managing director and chief executive for India and South Asia, said in a statement on Tuesday.  Profit slumped 77.8 percent to 829 million rupees ($12.49 million) in the quarter ended March 31, the company said, its lowest since the quarter ended June, 2003.

2018-12-18,"(Reuters) - Shares of Indian telecom company Reliance Communications Ltd plunged as much as 13 percent on Wednesday after the Economic Times reported that Department of Telecommunications (DoT) rejected a proposed spectrum sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The DoT rejected the deal to trade airwaves as it did not conform to its guidelines, the paper said, adding that as per the trading norms, the buyer is liable for dues that are not recovered from the seller. Jio informed the DoT that it won’t be held liable for RCom’s past dues related to airwaves, according to the report. The DoT move comes as a surprise as the it was widely expected to approve the transaction, though a day later than the original timeline due to last-minute paperwork, ET reported on Tuesday.  The transaction was key to the debt-laden telecom operator’s restructuring plan, announced earlier this year, which entailed the sale of telecom assets such as towers and airwaves to Jio. The plan to sell the assets had followed a settlement with telecom gearmaker Ericsson for partial payment of dues owed by RCom to the Swedish company. RCom shares, which traded at 14.5 rupees by 0428 GMT, have more than halved in value this year, as of last close. The companies were not immediately available for comment, while the DoT could not be immediately reached for comment.

The sale includes Reliance’s interest in the assets in the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, it said in a statement. U.S.-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co, which was a partner in the asset, also exited the blocks. In November 2014, Reliance and Pioneer announced exiting their stake in shale oil and gas transportation and distribution joint venture, which analysts had said was a precursor to Reliance’s move to exit U.S. shale operations.  The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, is the second such sale by the Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance in the United States.

2018-09-21,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd has shut down an offshore oil and gas field on the eastern coast of India, the company said in a statement on Friday, after seeing a natural decline in output for months. The closure marks the beginning of the end of the company’s first foray into oil and gas exploration and production that started in September 2008 when the field produced first oil. “Production from the field had been under natural decline and facing continuous challenges due to high water production and sand ingress... and had no remaining reserves,” the company statement said. The MA field, which was primarily an oil-producing field, is among the three oil and gas fields that the company has in the Bay of Bengal’s Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin. The others are the D1 and D3 fields, which are natural gas producing fields. These fields started production in April 2009. Reliance Industries’ turn into oil and gas exploration and production has had lacklustre results for the company’s owner and India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. He promised to produce almost 45 percent of India’s oil and gas needs by 2010 and save around $20 billion in its import bill. The output from the fields started declining rapidly after reaching a peak of 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 60 million cubic metres per day of gas as the company failed to manage the geological complexities of deep water production. After a hiatus of 10 years, Reliance , along with its partner BP Plc, has once again allocated an investment of $4 billion to develop new projects in the basin which will produce up to 35 million cubic metres per day of gas in phases over 2020 to 2022, the company said in its annual report published in May.

Teva raised its full-year forecast for adjusted EPS to $2.80-$2.95, from a previous estimate of $2.55-$2.80 and its shares were 8.5 percent higher in early U.S. trading. The company also said it was on track with plans to reduce its workforce by 14,000, having let over 9,000 employees go so far. Net debt decreased by $800 million to $27.6 billion. Israel-based Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, has been counting on Ajovy to revive its fortunes after it was forced to restructure to tackle a debt crisis. The release of the migraine drug had been delayed due to U.S. regulatory concerns about the manufacturing process, but Ajovy finally won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September. Ajovy suffered a setback in October when Express Scripts Holding Co, one of the largest U.S. prescription benefits managers, said it will cover new migraine drugs from Eli Lilly and Amgen Inc but not from Teva. CEO Kare Schultz told Reuters talks with all U.S. payers including Express Scripts were ongoing and that Ajovy had not been excluded. “We are seeing a very strong launch of Ajovy. There is strong acceptance, including the quarterly dosing,” Schultz, who has been in the job for a year, told a conference call. Teva has both a quarterly and monthly injection while its competitors have only monthly. The FDA in August approved Teva’s generic version of Mylan’s allergy injection EpiPen and Schultz said the company is boosting production. “We will be launching in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and then increasing supplies to the market throughout next year,” he said. Teva said it earned 68 cents per share excluding one-time items in the July-September period, down from $1.00 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast Teva would earn 54 cents a share ex-items on revenue of $4.53 billion, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Teva confirmed its revenue fell 19 percent to $4.53 billion due to generic competition to its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, price erosion in its U.S. generics business and a loss of revenue from the divestment of some of its products and the discontinuation of some activities. North American sales of Copaxone tumbled 43 percent in the quarter to $463 million while generic product sales in North America fell 25 percent. “Our generic revenues are showing clear signs of stabilisation,” Schultz said. The company will provide its 2019 forecast in February but said next year should be what it called a “trough year” for EBITDA and revenue.

2018-10-31,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court on Wednesday gave the government 10 days to disclose the details of an $8.7-billion military jet deal with France’s Dassault Aviation to former ministers and an activist who say the information should be in the public domain. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s deal for the purchase of 36 Rafale planes has become a major political controversy because of the escalating price and a decision to pick billionaire Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence as a domestic partner.  Reliance, which has no aeronautical expertise, was chosen instead of the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics, which has a long history of making planes. The Supreme Court ruled that if the material was strategic in nature or involved national security, the government might choose not to reveal it to the petitioners, but will instead  have to furnish it to the court in a sealed package. “We ask the center to give details of the pricing and strategic details of Rafale fighter aircraft in sealed cover in 10 days,” Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said, referring to the government. The ruling came in a hearing on petitions including a joint plea by former government ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, along with lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan, on the  jet deal. “There should be a court-monitored Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the Rafale deals,” Bhushan told the panel of three judges during arguments. The court’s order was a “very, very substantial step forward,” another petitioner, Arun Shourie, told television channel NDTV after the order. “Confidentiality does not relate to price, only technical specifications,” he added. “It will be subject to challenge. It will be difficult to say pricing is confidential.” The Official Secrets Act covers most of the details regarding the Rafale jets, including pricing, and it would not be possible for the government to share them with anyone,        Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, representing the government, told the court.  The panel said that if the government felt the pricing of the Rafale jet could not be shared with the court, even in a sealed cover, it should say so in an affidavit. The Supreme Court also asked the government to give copies of the decision-making process to the petitioners.

2018-01-16,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries has declared a 30 percent increase in the installed capacity of its export-focused oil refinery, a government report showed, increasing the size of the world’s largest refinery complex. India’s Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) in its October report showed 35.2 million tonnes a year as the installed capacity of Reliance’s refinery in the special economic zone (SEZ) at Jamnagar, in northwest India. That is up from 27 million tonnes, or 540,000 barrels per day (bpd), as of April 1 that PPAC reported in an August 2017 report.  The new capacity is the equivalent of 704,000 bpd of crude processing. Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd in 1999. This refinery sells  most of its fuels in the local market. The SEZ plant was added in 2008 and turned the entire Jamnagar complex into the world’s largest oil processing site. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed that Reliance has declared the increased SEZ capacity, which they said the company attributed to debottlenecking, or a by streamlining the processes at the plant. “They have declared enhanced capacity,” said one of the sources by telephone, without providing details on how the company raised the capacity. Reliance has been consistently operating its export-oriented refinery at a rate higher than the nameplate capacity Reliance had no immediate comment on the increase when contacted by Reuters.   Although most of the products from the SEZ plant are meant for overseas market, some like cooking gas are sold in local markets. Reliance’s refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades. Reliance, in a presentation to India’s Center for High Technology (CHT), said it wanted to raise the capacity of its Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, sources last year told Reuters.  CHT is a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements.

2018-09-24,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has vowed to stand firm on a multi-billion dollar deal to buy warplanes from France’s Dassault Aviation, as the opposition Congress party called on Monday for an inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing.  Former French President Francois Hollande, who approved the deal when he was in office, triggered a political storm in India after he said the Indian government influenced the choice of a local partner in the deal. New Delhi has denied the allegations, but opposition parties are gunning for Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the 2016 purchase of 36 Rafale planes estimated to be worth $8.7 billion, saying he overpaid for the planes and had not been transparent. Congress’ national spokesman Sanjay Jha said they would call for a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the deal, and organise public protests. “We will take it to the people’s court through protests and demonstrations as what is involved in this massive fraud is the taxpayers money,” he told Reuters. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday that the deal would proceed as planned. “These jets will come to India. They will enhance the combat ability of the Indian Air Force,” Jaitley told television news agency ANI, a Reuters affiliate. In recent months, the opposition has questioned the government on the choice of billionaire Indian businessman Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence as Dassault’s local partner instead of a state-run manufacturer with decades of experience. On Friday, Hollande told French news service Mediapart that New Delhi had put pressure on Dassault to choose Reliance. “We had no choice. We took the interlocutor that was given to us,” Hollande was quoted as saying.  Dassault has said it had picked Reliance as a partner for industrial reasons. Reliance has so far not commented on the matter. Under Indian defense procurement rules, a foreign firm must invest at least 30 percent of the contract in India to help it build up its manufacturing base and wean off imports. The French foreign ministry has said French authorities were not involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners involved in the Rafale deal.  India’s air force says it needs new combat jets to face a perceived twin threat from China and Pakistan. The Rafale planes were picked from a field that included Lockheed Martin’s F-16, Saab’s Gripen, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Russian MiG-35.

2018-11-28,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s top court ruled on Thursday that Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd must compensate 10 South Koreans for their forced labour during World War Two, a ruling that drew an immediate rebuke from Tokyo.  The decision echoed the Supreme Court’s landmark verdict last month that ruled in favour of South Koreans seeking compensation from Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. for their wartime forced labour.  It upheld a 2013 appeals court decision that Mitsubishi must pay 80 million won ($71,000) to each of five labourers or their families in compensation. In a separate ruling, the court also ordered Mitsubishi to pay up to 150 million won to each of another five plaintiffs or their families. Mitsubishi called the verdict “deeply regrettable”, saying in a statement that it would discuss its response with the Japanese government.  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono quickly issued a statement in which he said the court’s decisions were “totally unacceptable”. “This fundamentally overturns the legal basis for friendly ties between Japan and South Korea and is extremely regrettable,” Kono said. Kono urged Seoul to take steps to ensure “fair economic activity” for Japanese firms or Tokyo would consider its options, including referring the case to an international court. A senior official at Seoul’s foreign ministry said the government respected the ruling and would craft measures in a way that could heal the victims’ wounds but at the same time foster future relations with Japan.  Previous cases the group of five former labourers had brought in Japan were dismissed on the grounds that their right to reparation was terminated by a 1965 treaty normalising diplomatic ties between Seoul and Tokyo. However, the South Korean Supreme Court upheld last month’s ruling that Japan’s occupation of the peninsula was illegal.  “The treaty does not cover the right of the victims of forced labour to compensation for crimes against humanity committed by a Japanese company in direct connection with the Japanese government’s illegal colonial rule and war of aggression against the Korean peninsula,” the court said in a statement. Kim Seong-ju, a 90-year-old plaintiff in the second case, said she was sent to Japan when she was 15 with the recommendation of her teacher, who was a Japanese national.  “I was told that I could go to middle and high school and study more, but it turned out I had to work at the factory all the time,” Kim told a news conference after the ruling, showing her permanently injured hand. “Now I feel great.” Japan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan’s 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula and the use of comfort women, Japan’s euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.  The rows over wartime history have long been a stumbling block for relations between the East Asian neighbours, sparking concern that their joint efforts to rein in North Korea’s nuclear programme could be affected.

2018-07-18,"(Reuters) - Debt-laden Indian telecoms company Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) said its losses narrowed in the first quarter and it is confident of closing its debt resolution process by the end of September. It reported a loss of 3.42 billion rupees ($34 million) for April to June on Wednesday, saying lower expenses in terms of access charges and licensing fees had helped reduce losses. It was the company’s seventh straight quarter in the red but narrowed from a loss of 198 billion rupees in the previous quarter and a 12.21 billion rupee loss in the same quarter a year ago.  Like other Indian telecoms firms, RCom has been hit by a fierce price war and is the most leveraged of all listed telecoms carriers in India.   RCom, controlled by businessman Anil Ambani, is due to sell 181 billion rupee of assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm and Canada’s Brookfield, which will trim its huge debt pile. Revenue from operations fell about 26 percent to 10.06 billion rupees in the first quarter, it said.

2018-07-24,"SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries is looking to sell more naphtha, bringing its total naphtha exports through tenders for August lifting at 185,000 tonnes, traders said, the highest monthly spot volumes offered by the company since February. However, some 60 percent of the August volumes were considered off-specification as the grade does not meet the requirements of the petrochemical industry standard, the traders added.      It is unclear why Reliance’s naphtha contains more oxygenates than usual. Reliance officials were not available for immediate comment. Reliance had offered the long-range tanker size cargo for end-August loading from Sikka Port in western India through a tender which closes on Wednesday.  But the cargo contains 100 parts per million (ppm) of total oxygenates, twice the acceptable amount for making petrochemicals.  The fuel, however, could still be used but only if buyers have the means to lower the oxygenates levels.   Reliance, which operates the world’s biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, has already sold one such cargo with 100 ppm oxygenates to Vitol for early August loading at discounts to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.  Traders said the off-specification cargoes came at a time when European naphtha arriving next month in Asia was lower versus July.

Reliance on Wednesday announced that it has shut a gasoline-producing fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) unit in its export-oriented 704,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery. The unit is expected to restart within two week, it said.sp Reliance was to lift 40,000 tonnes of VGO, a feedstock for FCC, from Nayara’s refinery in Vadinar later this month, the sources said. Reuters on Wednesday reported that Reliance has declared force majeure on gasoline exports from its Jamnager refinery in western India. A U.S based trade source said Reliance has declared force majeure on 4 gasoline cargoes bound to the United States due to shutdown of the FCC. Reliance’s two refineries at Jamnagar have the capability to process about 1.5 million bpd oil. Reliance and Nayara Energy did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comments. Asia’s gasoline crack fell on Thursday but remained close to its highest level this year due to supply disruptions after Reliance Industries declared force majeure on gasoline supplies the previous day.

2018-03-07,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s cabinet approved on Wednesday an increase to the cap on airwaves that a mobile operator can hold to 35 percent from 25 percent, the federal government said in a statement. Based on recommendations of India’s telecoms regulator and the Telecom Commission, the cabinet also removed the intra-band cap but said mobile carriers would have to adhere to a 50 percent cap on combined airwaves holdings below 1 GHz bands. The changes will allow telecoms players to trade airwaves and potentially improve participation in spectrum auctions. The entry of Reliance Industries’ telecom firm Jio disrupted the sector in 2016 with free voice and cut-price data plans, driving consolidation in the industry and forcing out smaller players. Bharti Airtel is India’s top mobile carrier, while Vodafone Group Plc’s  India unit and Idea Cellular are merging their operations. New Delhi also decided to allow telecom network operators to pay for pricey spectrum in 16 installments instead of 10. Telecom industry lobby group, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), welcomed the changes. “The spectrum caps will help the consolidation process and debt extension will give some immediate cash flow relief,” COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said.

2018-10-17,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, has halted imports of Iranian crude ahead of U.S. sanctions against Tehran’s oil sector, its joint chief financial officer said. The United States plans to impose new sanctions on Iran’s oil sector from Nov. 4 in a bid to curb Iranian involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and bring Tehran to the negotiating table over its ballistic missile programme. V. Srikanth said Reliance has boosted purchases from other Middle Eastern suppliers and the United States to make up for the loss of Iranian barrels and reduced intake of Venezuelan oil. Venezuela’s oil production is at a 60-year low after years of underinvestment. “We continue to get (Venezuelan oil) but I would say it is lower,” Srikanth said. “Iranian supplies are zero. Therefore we have had to look at alternatives like... Middle Eastern crudes, and we are also taking some U.S. grades.” Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the U.S. financial system, where it operates some subsidiaries. The company’s decision to stop buying Iranian oil from October-November came after an advisory from its insurers, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in May. Reliance imported 2 million barrels of Iranian oil in September, ship tracking data obtained from sources showed. Its two advanced plants at Jamnagar in western Gujarat state can together process 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and have the capability to turn cheaper, dirtier crudes into high-value refined products. Reliance on Wednesday reported a record quarterly profit in the July to September period. “Our integrated refining and petrochemicals business generated strong cash flows,” chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a statement. However, its gross refining margin for the three months through September, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, fell to $9.50 per barrel, a 3-1/2 year low.  Reliance said higher oil prices, a narrowing price spread between light and heavy crude and weaker light distillate cracks during the quarter had affected its refining and marketing business. Reliance had also declared force majeure on gasoline exports from its Jamnagar site in August due to a technical glitch at a fluid catalytic cracker. The company’s exports of refined products during the September quarter totalled 10.1 million tonnes compared to 11.2 million tonnes a year earlier.   Srikanth said the Indian government’s recent order to state-owned fuel retailers to cut marketing margins by 1 rupee a liter will not affect his firm’s plan to ramp up its network of retail fuel stations.     The company has 1,325 fuel stations. The price of gasoil and gasoline sold through that network is on a par with that of state fuel retailers, Srikanth said.

Isha Ambani, 27, will marry Anand Piramal, 33, in the financial capital of Mumbai on Tuesday, but the festivities begin this weekend in the desert city of Udaipur, with three days of song, dance and pre-wedding rituals. Wedding guests have access to an app mapping out the activities, which include a private concert by Beyonce.  More than 100 chartered flights are landing in Udaipur’s sleepy airport, a source on the spot, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. Bollywood stars, including Priyanka Chopra, who got married last week, will also attend.  Indian media have speculated that the guest list includes former U.S. President Bill Clinton, along with his wife and  Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton.  “The event will have many visitors from abroad, so customs and immigration counters have been set up at the airport and will remain active for the next five days,” the airport source said. The source declined to say how much Beyonce was being paid for the concert and media have not reported a figure. The wedding will bring together two of India’s most influential families.  Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, has a net worth of $47 billion, Forbes magazine says. The Piramals have interests in pharmaceuticals and real estate, and according to a report in the news magazine India Today, have given the couple a 50,000-sq-foot (4,645-sq-m) sea-facing home in Mumbai. Many in India, where millions live in dire poverty, have closely followed the preparations, including the couple’s engagement at the luxury Villa D’Este hotel on Italy’s Lake Como, attended by more than 600 guests, and featuring a private performance by singer John Legend. Newspapers and websites have been full of details about the ceremonies, the designer jewellery and clothes, with some of India’s top designers dressing the wedding party.  The wedding invitation includes necklaces and precious stones stacked in a two-tier floral box, at a cost of 300,000  rupees each ($4,236), India Today said. The wedding is the latest in a series of high-profile  marriages that began last year, when cricket captain Virat Kohli tied the knot with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma.

2018-05-30,"NEW DELHI/LONDON (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran. Reliance’s move, expected to take effect in October or November, came after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. India has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions but companies with links to the U.S. financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply. Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others. Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said. A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal. This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November. Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran. The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran. In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said. The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. In 2017, Reliance’s oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd. Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union. Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Italy’s Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran. Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the U.S. financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants. Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of U.S. crude. After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme. During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit.  Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the U.S. move to reimpose sanctions. Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The company’s global depository receipts are traded in the U.S. market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the U.S. debt market, according to its annual report.

2018-07-30,"(Reuters) - India’s Idea Cellular Ltd reported a surprise quarterly profit on Monday on a one-time gain from the sale of telecom towers, but an aggressive pricing war set in motion by deep-pocketed rival Reliance Jio continued to dent its topline. Analysts, on average, were expecting a net loss of 13.71  billion rupees, according to estimates by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, a gain of about 33.65 billion rupees from the sale of Idea Cellular Infrastructure Services, helped the company turn in a profit. Revenue from operations fell about 28 percent to 58.89 billion rupees. The highly competitive market has forced smaller rivals to exit and prompted Idea to merge operations with Vodafone’s Indian unit. India’s telecom department has given the deal its nod, Idea said last week. The merger, which will potentially create India’s biggest telecom operator, is expected to close shortly, it added.  Idea’s larger rival Bharti Airtel Ltd posted a surprise profit last week, helped by tax gains, but its bottomline remained under pressure as it tries to keep up with Mukesh Ambani-backed Jio’s cut-price strategy.

2018-09-17,"ZURICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Clariant and new anchor shareholder Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) will merge their high-performance materials businesses and install a SABIC manager as head of the group as they strengthen their partnership. The new joint venture and governance accord announced on Tuesday mark the first concrete signs of how SABIC’s arrival as a white knight in January is reshaping the speciality chemicals group that U.S. activists had targeted. The partners had agreed that SABIC would not take over Clariant but could boost the 24.99 percent stake it bought from the activists to rescue Clariant from a hostile takeover threat, Clariant Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann told a news conference.  Reuters reported in June that SABIC, the world’s fourth-largest chemicals maker, was considering increasing its holding in Clariant and pursuing joint ventures. Clariant shares were up 6.1 percent at 0915 GMT, leading the European chemical sector index, after news of the revamp that will let Clariant focus on higher-value speciality chemicals. SABIC shares gained 0.7 percent. SABIC Specialties Executive Vice President Ernesto Occhiello, 58, will take over next month as chief executive.  Kottmann, who is 62 and has been CEO for 10 years, will now become chairman. Clariant and U.S. group Huntsman last Ocotber  abandoned plans for a $20 billion merger, a win for activist investors who fought the deal for months on the grounds it would destroy shareholder value.  Clariant will hold a majority stake in the new business, which combines its Additives and high-value Masterbatches divisions with parts of SABIC’s Specialties business. Clariant will divest the remaining Plastics & Coatings business by 2020, it said in a statement. By 2021, the group aims to generate annual sales of around 9 billion Swiss francs ($9.36 billion), compared with 6.38 billion in 2017, and a margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around 20 percent. Kottmann said it was important to gain critical mass in specialty chemicals and said the $15 billion in sales the company could have achieved if it had merged with Huntsman was “still the number which is important for us”. “The move now is a first move into this direction. I’m sure that we will have more opportunities in the years to come to further go into higher value specialities and to strengthen our business areas, for example care chemicals or catalysis or natural resources,” Kottmann said. Middle Eastern companies have been eager to expand into advanced downstream chemicals operations like the catalysts that Clariant produces to help speed up processes at chemicals plants. Saudi state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in 2015 bought half the synthetic rubber business of Germany’s Lanxess for around 1.2 billion euros. The moves show that Saudi companies are increasingly trying to raise their influence outside the kingdom as part of the ambitious Vision 2030 plan which was set out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country’s economy from oil. The group said combining operations was set to generate annual synergies of around 100 million Swiss francs over three years from the deal’s closing. It would cost 80 million to implement the plan, which would take force at the start of 2020 and significantly boost earnings per share in the first year. Under the governance agreement, Clariant’s board of directors will expand to 12 members from 10 now, of which four will be nominated by SABIC. Shareholders must approve the change at a meeting set for Oct. 16. Even including a one-off payment to SABIC to be determined later, its pro forma 2019 net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio should not exceed 2.4 times and leave Clariant’s investment-grade debt rating untouched, it said. Increased earnings quality and operating cash flow will let Clariant at least maintain a steady if not higher dividend every year, it said.($1 = 0.9619 Swiss francs) Editing by Keith Weir",https://in.reuters.com/article/clariant-sabic/clariant-sabic-tighten-links-under-new-partnership-idINKCN1LY1E9

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to buy a total of 360 billion rupees ($4.95 billion) worth government bonds under its open market operations this month. This comes after the RBI eased mandatory cash requirement rules for banks last week. However, analysts feel that measures would do little to sway market sentiment. “The RBI measures are not really sufficient to change the sentiment because even though it implies there would be lesser market borrowing, the fiscal deficit target remains the same,” said Dhananjay Sinha, head of institutional research at Emkay Global Financial Services. “This means that the RBI will be looking to tap in other sources, which wont make much of a difference eventually.” Kotak Mahindra fell as much as 12.2 percent to its lowest since January on concerns RBI may clamp down on the bank for failing to bring down promoter stake as per regulations. Bandhan Bank Ltd shares plummeted to lowest since their March debut after the RBI put curbs on its branch expansion and froze CEO pay for its failure to bring down main shareholder’s stake to below 40 percent. The broader NSE index was down 0.67 percent at 10,859.80.10 as of 0650 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.37 percent lower at 36,091.54. Oil refiner Reliance Industries, down 3.4 percent, contributed to around a third of the NSE index’s loss. Oil prices continued to surge with brent oil hitting a near four-year high. Telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd hit a 20-month low as the stock broke below a support at 346.6 rupees, technical analysis showed.

2018-08-17,"NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India on Friday allowed import of petcoke for use as feedstock in some industries, sending shares of cement manufacturers higher. Cement companies, which account for about three-fourths of the country’s petcoke use, were impacted by petcoke-related policy flip-flops, which began with a supreme court judgment banning use of the fuel in and around capital New Delhi last year. The directorate general of foreign trade banned the use of imported petcoke as fuel, but said shipments for use as feedstock in certain industries were allowed. “Import of Petcoke is allowed for only cement, lime kiln, calcium carbide and gasification industries, when used as the feedstock or in the manufacturing process on actual user condition,” the directorate general of foreign trade said. Shares of cement companies such as Ultratech Cement Ltd, Shree Cement Ltd, Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd rose following the announcement. Shree Cement, one of the country’s significant users of petcoke, saw its shares rise as much as 3.6 percent to 17,898 rupees ($255.36), its highest level this month. Usage of petcoke, a dirtier alternative to coal, in the energy-hungry country has come under scrutiny due to rising pollution levels in major cities.  India’s imports of petcoke have declined this year as cement companies substituted some of their petcoke with coal to avoid production delays due to pollution-related policy changes. As the world’s largest consumer of petcoke, India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption of about 27 million tonnes, mainly from the United States. Local producers include Indian Oil Corp, Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp. India is the world’s biggest consumer of petroleum coke, which is a dark solid carbon material that emits 11 percent more greenhouse gases than coal, according to the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.

2018-07-03,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s crude shipments to India, its third largest export market, fell 21 percent in the first half of the year, according to internal documents from state-run PDVSA, adding to supply troubles for Indian refiners as they are increasingly pressed to diversify oil imports. Venezuela’s production decline to a 30-year low and export woes stemming from mismanagement, lack of investment and payment delays are affecting almost all of the OPEC-nation’s customers. But the impact on India is notable and comes as its refiners are now preparing for a “drastic reduction to zero” of oil imports from U.S.-sanctioned Iran. The talks focused on how to remedy export delays, according to a person familiar with the matter. Venezuela sent almost 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude to India in the first half of the year, a 21 percent drop versus the 355,500 bpd shipped in the same period of 2017, according to PDVSA trade documents.  The decline is the second steepest after the United States, which has suffered a drop of about 30 percent in crude imports from Venezuela this year, the documents seen by Reuters show. If crude supplies from Iran and Venezuela, two of India’s top five oil suppliers, cannot be secured in coming months, some of the nation’s refiners would have to rely almost entirely on sourcing the heavy barrels they need from Iraq, according to analysts. “Indian refiners are very worried about supply from Iran, but also from Venezuela,” said Robert Campbell from consultancy Energy Aspects. Saudi Arabia is expected to boost supply to India in the short term, but those barrels would not match the quality of the missing Venezuelan crude, he added. “The lack of heavy barrels is not a problem only in the Atlantic Basin but in Asia as well,” he added. PDVSA and Nayara did not reply to requests for comment. India’s Reliance declined to comment.  India is the world’s fourth largest refiner after the United States, China and Russia. While Chinese and Russian firms resell a large portion of the Venezuelan crude and fuel they receive to monetize oil-for-loan agreements, Indian refiners need the barrels they get through crude supply contracts with PDVSA. Venezuela’s crude output is declining faster than expected amid insufficient investment, attempts to seize its overseas assets over payment disputes and skilled workers leaving its oil industry due to low salaries and an extended corruption probe within PDVSA. The country’s oil production averaged 1.58 million bpd in the first five months of 2018, according to figures reported to OPEC, its lowest annual level since 1985. The fall, which is putting pressure on global supply and contributing to growing oil prices, has also taken a toll on exports. PDVSA last month requested customers not send tankers to its main port of Jose to alleviate congestion. But vessels have continued arriving mainly for Chinese, Indian and U.S. clients, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. In June, PDVSA shipped to India 268,300 bpd after servicing some vessels that had waited for up to a month to load. The Venezuelan firm plans to deliver some 240,000 bpd in July, according to Reuters and PDVSA data.     The unstable crude supply from Venezuela to India in recent months has mainly benefited Iraq, India’s largest crude source, and United Arab Emirates, which in May replaced Venezuela as India’s fourth biggest crude supplier.

IOC sold up to 30,000 tonnes of naphtha on late Thursday in two separate cargoes for second-half August loading from Paradip to a trading house at discounts of about $14 a tonne to its own price formula on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, the traders said. IOC this year stopped exporting naphtha from Paradip, which can process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, as it was using the fuel as feedstock for gasoline production, said the traders, who closely track Indian cargoes. Indian Oil last offered a cargo of naphtha from Paradip for loading in May 2017, Reuters previously reported, though it was unclear if the cargo was finally sold.  The company conducted a 45-day maintenance at Paradip starting in March while it has regularly been exporting naphtha from its Chennai plant. The sales added to rare offers from Reliance Industries and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).  HPCL offered up to 20,000 tonnes of naphtha for loading from Aug. 19 to 24 from Visakhapatnam, the first cargo out of the refinery this year, through a tender closing on Aug. 6, the traders said. Reliance offered 35,000 tonnes for heavy naphtha for loading at the end of August in a tender that close on July 31, said three of the traders, though they said buying interest for the grade was limited. Reliance mainly stopped exporting heavy naphtha while using it as a feedstock for gasoline and petrochemical production.  The company, however, exports open-specification grade naphtha which is used to make plastics among other petrochemicals.  Asia’s naphtha fundamentals have improved recently as traders expect fewer cargoes to arrive this month from Europe and the Mediterranean, sending  margins for the light fuel to a seven-month high of above $120 a tonne in late July before easing.

2018-01-20,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s environment ministry has placed restrictions on the use of imported petroleum coke in the capital Delhi and its surrounding region, in the latest effort to curb rising air pollution.  As the world’s largest consumer of petcoke, India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption of about 27 million tonnes, mainly from the United States. Local producers include Indian Oil Corp, Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp. “Only consented and registered industrial units of NCR States shall be permitted to directly import pet coke and consignment shall be in the name of user industrial units for their own use,” the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said in a notification issued late on Friday.  Cement plants and other industries approved to use petcoke in the region would also need to obtain permission from the state pollution control board to continue operations, it said. The ministry has also banned imports of petroleum coke for trading purposes in the capital region, the notice said, adding that even industrial units allowed to use petcoke will not be allowed to store more than three months worth of their consumption. India will also track the trade of the commodity, and has asked both sellers and consumers to submit monthly reports on  petcoke-related transactions.  India is the world’s biggest consumer of petroleum coke, which is a dark solid carbon material that emits 11 percent more greenhouse gases than coal, according to the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. India’s government is in favor of imposing a wider ban on the import of petcoke, according to a government affidavit filed with its top court in December, a ruling on which is expected next month.

2018-07-10,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refiners cut imports of Iranian oil last month as they started weaning their plants off crude from the country to avoid sanctions by the United States that are set to take effect in November. India’s monthly oil imports from Iran declined to 592,800 barrels per day (bpd) in June, down 16 percent from May, according to data from industry and shipping sources. The United States in May said it would reimpose the sanctions after withdrawing from a 2015 agreement with Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany, and Britain, where Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of earlier sanctions.  The government of India, Iran’s top oil client after China, asked refiners last month to prepare for drastic reductions or even zero Iranian oil imports. The first set of sanctions will take effect on Aug. 6 and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. U.S. officials said in June they would push countries to reduce their Iranian oil imports to zero. The Indian refiners will want to comply with the limits to maintain their access to the U.S. financial system. “Trump administration will push for zero crude, condensate and products exports from Iran,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, Head of East of Suez Oil at energy consultancy FGE. “The zero tolerance policy and the pace with which it is moving no doubt concerns Iran’s current crude buyers.” Overall, India’s oil imports in June rose 10.1 percent from a year ago to 4.82 million bpd, the data showed. Overall purchases climbed on a higher intake of crude from Mexico, the United States and Azerbaijan. Imports from other Middle East suppliers also increased.  Lower purchases by private refiners dragged down India’s June imports from Iran although state refiners stepped up purchases. Sources told Reuters last month that private refiners Nayara Energy and Reliance Industries Ltd plan to halt Iranian oil imports. The two firms significantly cut their imports from Iran in June. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd continued to skip Iran oil imports for a second month in June, the data showed. State refiners, accounting for about 60 percent of India’s nearly 5 million bpd of refining capacity, lifted 10 percent more Iranian volumes in June compared to May, at about 454,000 bpd, the data from the sources showed. The sources declined to be identified since they are not authorized to speak to the media. On a yearly basis, India’s imports from Iran were 19.5 percent higher, the data showed. Indian state refiners had cut Iranian oil imports in the 2017/18 financial year because of a dispute over the development rights for an Iranian natural gas field. However, the state refiners raised their imports in the current fiscal year starting in April after Iran offered free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. For the first six months of 2018, India’s Iranian oil imports increased by 8.4 percent to 585,000 bpd. In April to June 2018, the first quarter of this fiscal year, India’s oil imports from Iran rose by about 24 percent from the previous quarter to about 647,000 bpd, the data showed. Imports by state refiners during the period more than doubled to about 413,400 bpd from 191,700 bpd, the data showed. Indian refiners will likely gain more clarity on how much the United States would like them to cut after a meeting with U.S. officials scheduled for July 16 to 17, said an official with a state-run refiner who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

2018-02-28,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian mobile carrier Aircel Ltd filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, pressured by a high debt pile and mounting losses following a price war triggered by a telecom upstart. Talks between Aircel, 74 percent owned by Malaysia’s Maxis Communications Bhd, and Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) to combine their wireless business was called off in late 2017 due to regulatory and legal uncertainties and interventions by various parties. Aircel, whose debt amounts to 155 billion rupees ($2.38 billion), then tried unsuccessfully to restructure its debt. “Post-detailed discussions with the financial lenders and shareholders, the company could not reach consensus with respect to restructuring of its debt and funding,” Aircel said in a statement.  Aircel said it had decided to pursue a resolution under the country’s Bankruptcy Code as the “appropriate recourse.” The entry of Reliance Jio in 2016 with free voice and cut-price data plans forced smaller operators to exit the crowded and competitive telecoms market, while bigger players such as Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian unit are merging to stave off competition. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, Malaysian tycoon T.Ananda Krishnan who backed Aircel was poised to lose a total of about $7 billion, marking his biggest ever hit on a soured investment, a Bloomberg report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Maxis, a holding company for some of Krishnan’s telecom ventures, has made about $3.4 billion of shareholder advances to Aircel that it won’t be able recoup, the report said. Maxis also stand to lose around $1.2 billion it injected in return for common stock and subscription to $1.6 billion of redeemable preference shares in the Indian mobile carrier, the report said. Maxis did not immediately respond for a comment.

2018-10-18,"DUBAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) started producing and exporting a new crude grade known as Umm Lulu this month, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. The new oil will help lift ADNOC’s oil exports after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia pledged to increase output to stabilise global oil markets following disruptions in supplies from several producers, including Iran and Venezuela. The new crude grade is a blend produced from its Umm Lulu and SARB fields, operated by ADNOC Offshore, with initial production of 50,000 barrels per day (bpd). The fields are expected to contribute to ADNOC’s production capacity target of 3.5 million bpd by the end of 2018, the spokesman said last month. ADNOC has sold two 500,000-barrel cargoes of the crude loading in November to South Korea’s second largest refiner GS Caltex and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd at close to parity to the official selling price (OSP) for Das Blend, trade sources said. GS Caltex could not be reached for immediate comment. A Reliance executive said on Wednesday that he could not confirm if they bought the oil. “We have had to look at alternatives, like we are taking Middle Eastern crudes and we are also taking some of U.S. grades,” he said, after Reliance halted oil imports from Iran. Umm Lulu has an API gravity of 38.7 degrees and contains 0.7 percent sulphur.

2018-11-01,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese internet group Tencent Holdings plans to expand into providing services to industries such as healthcare and connected cars in a move to promote growth beyond its mainstay consumer business. Tencent, China’s largest social media and gaming company that operates the WeChat messenger app, in September announced a major restructuring aimed at moving from being a consumer business towards one catering to industry too.  Dowson Tong, president of Tencent’s newly formed Cloud and Smart Industries Group, told the company’s annual global partners conference that the new group would focus on artificial intelligence, cloud services, big data and security.  “If the development of internet is said to have centered on consumers over the past 20 years, it will probably focus on business and industry over the next 20 years,” Tong said at the livecast event in Nanjing.  Tencent’s restructuring comes as the company’s main business of gaming and online services grew at a slower pace, hit by regulatory hurdles this year. The restructuring created the industry-facing group led by Tong, who had spearheaded Tencent’s cloud business. The company also consolidated three content-related businesses into one.   Tong said Tencent planned to continue to improve its traditional stronghold of consumer internet services, while developing new industry-facing services focusing on sectors such as healthcare, transportation, education, and retail.   Tencent vice-president Zhong Xiangping said at the conference that the company’s autonomous driving business was a software and services provider. It also provides cloud services to business partners in connected cars, an area where Tencent has obtained road testing licences in Shenzhen and Beijing, Zhong said.    Lin Songtao, vice president in charge of Tencent’s content platforms, said the company had set aside a 5 billion yuan ($720.13 million) fund to encourage creative content for Tencent’s various platforms that include WeChat and Spotify-like music apps.  Lin also said launched Yoo, a new short-form video app that will focus on content of 1-3 minutes, which he said is increasingly the most popular format of media consumption.

2018-05-23,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said on Wednesday it could launch its migraine treatment as soon as mid-September, after an initial delay. The debt-ridden company is counting on the drug - fremanezumab - along with Huntington’s treatment Austedo, to help it return to growth. Teva and Eli Lilly are in a race to put a second migraine drug on the market, after rival Amgen won FDA approval last week for Aimovig to prevent migraine headaches in adults. Lilly has said it expects an FDA decision on its galcanezumab drug by the third quarter. “We are preparing to launch the product immediately when approved,” said Brendan O’Grady, head of Teva’s North America Commercial division in a statement. “Migraine patients have waited years for new preventive treatments to enter the market.” Last month Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, said it would be delayed until no later than the end of 2018. Teva said on Wednesday that the FDA’s prescription drug user fee act (PDUFA) action date was set for Sept. 16, when the FDA will likely make its decision on fremanezumab, which comes in monthly and quarterly doses. It noted that there had been no additional data requests from the FDA. “Our primary goal is to bring preventive treatment options to migraine patients as quickly as possible,” said Hafrun Fridriksdottir, executive vice president of Teva’s global R&D. “We are encouraged by the ongoing communications with the FDA as we work to bring this important therapy to patients.” Teva’s share price has fallen 30 percent since last August due to a decline in U.S. generic drug prices and copycat competition for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. Its shares were up 0.1 percent at $21.03 in early Nasdaq trading. Teva also was saddled with $35 billion in debt from its $40.5 billion purchase in 2016 of Allergan’s generic drug business Actavis, forcing it to sell assets. Its gross debt stood at $30.8 billion as of March 31.

2018-08-21,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Daikin Industries, the world’s largest maker of air conditioning equipment, is turning to Africa for further expansion, 10 years after a successful gamble on sharing its key technology with a Chinese company. As Japanese manufacturers such as Panasonic stepped back from home appliances over a decade ago to avoid price wars with Asian rivals, Daikin did the opposite, going head-to-head with the likes of South Korea’s LG. Fighting off low-cost competitors through local partnerships and acquisitions, Daikin grabbed top share in markets such as India. Africa, where LG and China’s Haier are established giants, may seem like another difficult target for Daikin. But Yoshihiro Mineno, Daikin’s senior executive in charge of Asia, said the company is used to silencing critics, recalling the controversy more than 15 years ago over its decision to target mass markets overseas. “Many sceptics at the time said it would be impossible to make profits in the ‘volume zone’ in Asia, and that it was pointless to invest there,” Mineno told Reuters in an interview. Conventional wisdom, he said, held that the 94-year-old company should focus on high-end markets.  Daikin saw limited potential for growth in that area, however, and executives knew the company would have to focus on low cost and high volume if it wanted to boost its global presence. The company’s market value now exceeds those of electronics conglomerates Panasonic Corp and Hitachi Ltd. “If advanced technologies or added-value products are your only selling points, your rivals are likely to catch up and overtake you,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at the research arm of Ace Securities. “But Daikin’s business model is backed by cost competitiveness,” Yasuda added. “It’s among a few Japanese companies that can compete head to head with the Chinese.” The United States, the world’s largest market for air conditioning, has been tougher to crack. Daikin has struggled to compete with local rivals such as United Technologies’ Carrier and Johnson Controls’ York, which specialise in ducted air conditioning. Daikin acquired the U.S. company Goodman in 2012 to strengthen its expertise in that area, but has made little headway.    The prospect of tariffs from a trade war between the United States and China adds another headache: Daikin assembles air conditioners in the U.S. using some Chinese-made parts. Mineno said the company may need to export components from elsewhere in Asia if the trade war escalates. In 2006, Daikin took over Malaysian contract manufacturer OYL Industries for $2.1 billion. The deal boosted its purchasing power, and provided access to cheaper global suppliers and nimble product development. Two years later, it shocked the industry by agreeing to a partnership with major Chinese rival Gree Electric Appliances. The deal gave Daikin mass-market production capabilities in return for access to its advanced inverter technology, which saves electricity by efficiently regulating temperatures.  Critics said the move amounted to self-sabotage because of the potential for such valuable components to be copied.  The technology did end up in air conditioners from other Chinese companies. But Daikin expanded production so quickly with Gree’s help that it drove smaller rivals out of the market.  “We effectively created a market for inverter air conditioners with Gree,” Mineno said. Gree is still a partner in producing low-end models and components for Daikin, although they compete in most other segments. “Being the No. 1 player in inverter machines gave us access to government officials and allowed us to influence regulations,” Mineno said, adding that stricter energy consumption rules, for instance, made Daikin inverters more attractive. Daikin’s sales have tripled since the OYL acquisition, with overseas markets now accounting for 80 percent of its $20 billion annual revenue.  By contrast, other Japanese manufacturers have struggled to maintain their edge in products that include televisions, smartphone screens and semiconductors. Experts say most failed to innovate enough to continue charging more than their Chinese and Korean rivals, eventually giving up both market share and margins.    Executives said Daikin’s biggest growth driver is India, where it has established itself as a top player despite competition from LG, Samsung Electronics and local manufacturers. It appointed Indian industry veteran Kanwal Jeet Jawa to lead operations there, built a sales network and localised production with low-cost know-how from OYL. Daikin’s market share in room air conditioners in India jumped from less than 2 percent in 2010 to 17 percent over eight years, lifting the company to the top total sales spot of air conditioners for commercial buildings and industrial use. Jawa will lead the expansion in Africa as well, the company said. It plans to set up a regional office in east Africa in a few months.      Jawa said Daikin would continue to aim for the volume zone. “It’s a very price-sensitive market,” he said of Africa. “We want to use our leverage of Indian operations and we want to replicate what we have done in India.” Daikin is adding production capacity for further global expansion. It opened an assembly plant in Vietnam in May and plans another in Malaysia this year. It is also considering a new Indian plant to help produce products for Africa, Jawa said. Daikin has set a 2020 sales target of 90 billion yen  ($812.71 million) for Africa and the Middle East, an increase of 11 percent from last year, but Mineno said it may need to revise that upward. “Globally, I still see a lot of growth potential that can be unleashed by our volume-zone strategy,” he said.

2018-05-10,"(Reuters) - Shares of Indian telecom services providers fell sharply on Friday after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd unveiled a new post-paid plan as it takes on bigger rivals such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd. Shares of Idea fell as much as 8.1 percent to their lowest since February 2011, while Airtel declined about 5.8 percent. Reliance Jio’s entry into the telecoms sector has set off a brutal price war among operators as they drastically cut prices to compete with Jio’s bottomed-out plans. For the top three big telecom operators in India, post-paid users make up only 7 percent of the total subscribers, but contribute more than 20 percent to their revenues, said Jefferies. Airtel and Idea are expected to launch new plans in response to Jio’s offer and thus see a further decline in their average revenue per user, Jefferies added.

2018-09-14,"(Reuters) - Shares of Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries rose over 5 percent in after-hours trading on Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company’s new migraine treatment, a drug Teva has been banking on to help revive its fortunes. The wholesale price of the drug, Ajovy, is $575 a month, the same as Aimovig, a similar monthly injection sold by Amgen Inc and Novartis AG that has been available in the United States since May. Teva’s drug can also be given once every three months - in three consecutive injections - an option priced at $1,725.  “We felt that $575 was an appropriate price,” Brendan O’Grady, head of Teva’s North America commercial operations, told Reuters. He said Teva has been actively negotiating with health insurers and other payers for months on how best to allow patient access to the new drug. Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker had hoped to receive approval for Ajovy, known generically as fremanezumab, by June.  Its release was delayed due to U.S. regulatory concerns about the manufacturing process at the South Korean plant of its development partner Celltrion. Around 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, making for a large market that has attracted several drugmakers. Eli Lilly & Co is also developing a migraine treatment in the same new class of drugs, with the FDA expected to take action by Sept. 27. Demand for Aimovig has been strong, buoyed in part by Amgen programs giving patients two months of free samples followed by up to a year’s supply of the drug for those having trouble with insurance coverage. Analysts, on average, have forecast annual Aimovig sales of nearly $1 billion by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data. Teva said it would offer an assistance program for commercially insured patients, bringing their out-of-pocket costs to as little as $0. Deutsche Bank has forecast peak annual sales of fremanezumab of $500 million. While Teva has an enormous portfolio of generic medicines, it has long been dependent on its top-selling branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, now facing generic competition, which accounted for about 20 percent of total sales.  Ajovy, which will initially be available in a pre-filled syringe rather than a more sophisticated auto-injector device like Aimovig’s, is seen as crucial for Teva’s recovery.  Shares of Teva, which rose 2.9 percent to close at $22.85 in regular trading, were up another 5.4 percent at $24 after hours. The company’s share price has been in freefall for most of the past three years, losing about two-thirds of its value as Teva struggled to bring new drugs to market and became saddled by debt from a $40.5 billion purchase of Allergan’s generic drug business in 2016. In a bid to lower debt, Teva is in the process of cutting more than a quarter of its workforce and closing or selling 10 of its factories. Teva said last month its net debt had fallen to $28.4 billion from a peak of $35 billion. In addition to the migraine drug, Teva is banking on Austedo, an experimental Huntington’s disease treatment, to help it return to growth.

2018-02-15,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India imported a record 4.93 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in January to feed its expanded refining capacity and meet rising demand, ship tracking data obtained from sources and data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts showed. The world’s third-biggest oil importer shipped in 13.6 percent more oil in January than a year earlier and about 12.5 percent more than the previous month, the data showed. Imports in January were high as state-run refiners, which operate two-third of India’s nearly 5 million bpd capacity, usually boost runs in the March quarter to meet government-set targets. “All refineries are running high amidst a strong recovery in demand, leading to higher (oil) imports,” said Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at FGE. India, which imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, has emerged as a key driver for growth in global oil demand.  Due to higher imports and rising global crude prices, India’s oil import bill in January surged by 42.6 percent from a year ago to $11.66 billion. The country is set to surpass China as the fastest-growing oil products market in Asia, with fuel demand growing by 6.1 percent in 2018, according to a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. FGE expects India’s January crude runs to reach 5.27 million bpd, about 280,000 bpd higher than a year earlier, as the country’s new refining capacities are operating at almost full rate. India has not yet published refining data for January. “The (crude) runs are high before the spring maintenance in India and elsewhere in the region. Margins are good and so is demand, why wouldn’t they run?” Kumaran added. India’s refining capacity addition of 170,000 bpd at the Kochi and Bathinda plants, along with Indian Oil Corp’s 300,000 bpd Paradip refinery, are operating at a full rate. Last year Reliance Industries, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, in western India, declared 30 percent higher capacity of its export focused plant. India is increasing refining capacity to keep pace with expected growth in fuel demand, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to boost the manufacturing sector. The country aims to lift its refining capacity by 77 pct to 8.8 million bpd by 2030, according to a government report. Global oil majors Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, BP, Shell and Total are vying to tap a sizeable share of fast-growing Indian fuel markets. India’s annual fuel demand rose 10.3 percent in January, with consumption of diesel and gasoline rising in double digits.

2018-01-16,"(Reuters) - India’s oil imports rose by about 1.8 percent in 2017 to a record 4.37 million barrels per day (bpd) as the country boosted purchases to feed its expanded refining capacity, ship-tracking data obtained from sources and data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts showed. To meet its growing fuel demand India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer, raised its refining capacity in the second half of 2017. India’s capacity expansion to about 5 million bpd was aided by Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s largest refining complex, declaring 30 percent higher capacity of its export-focused plant. In December the country’s oil imports totalled 4.38 million bpd, a decline of about 6.4 percent from the previous month and about 2 percent from a year ago, the data showed. In 2017 Iraq for the first time emerged as the top supplier to India on an annual basis while Saudi Arabia slipped to the second position, the data showed. Iran was the third biggest oil supplier to India in 2017, replacing Venezuela. India’s imports from Iran in 2017 totalled about 471,000 bpd, marginally lower than a year ago, the data showed. In April-December, the first nine months of this fiscal year, Iranian supplies to India averaged at about 437,000 bpd, a decline of about 18 percent from a year ago, the data showed.  Indian state refiners plan to cut imports from Iran by about a fifth from a year over a dispute on the award of development rights of a giant gas field.  India’s oil imports from Iran surged to the highest level in nine months in December. The Middle East continued to be the biggest oil supplier to India, although the region’s share in imports declined to about 63 percent from about 64.5 percent a year ago. Imports from the Middle East declined due to the narrowing price differential with Atlantic Basin oil tied to Brent. The average premium for Brent eased against Dubai crude to about $2 a barrel in 2017 from around $3.5 in 2016. Oil supplies from Africa rose marginally, accounting for about 16 percent of overall imports, while that from Latin America declined for a third year, with the region’s share shrinking to about 15 percent from 16 percent.

2018-03-22,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro ordered a re-denomination of the ailing bolivar currency on Thursday, by knocking three zeroes off amid hyperinflation and a crippling economic crisis. The measure to divide the so-called bolivar fuerte - or “strong bolivar” - currency by 1,000 would take effect from June 4, the socialist leader said. It would not have any impact on the bolivar’s value. The move illustrates the collapse of the bolivar, which has fallen 99.99 percent against the U.S. dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in April 2013. A $100 purchase of bolivars then would now be worth just a single U.S. cent. But Maduro, 55, presented the move as a positive development intended to protect Venezuela against currency speculators and a U.S.-led “economic war” against the OPEC member. Critics said the currency measure was no panacea for Venezuela’s economic mess and just a psychological ploy to make Venezuelans forget the extent of the hyperinflation. While the move sounds like a currency revaluation, economists consider it a currency re-denomination as the country is not changing the value of its official exchange rate. Venezuelans will not need to turn in the currency now in their wallets but all new currency printed or minted will be in the new denominations. Millions of Venezuelans are suffering from shortages of food and medicines during a fifth year of recession that critics blame on government incompetence and corruption, but Maduro says is due to Western hostility against him plus the fall of oil prices. “Venezuela has been victim of a brutal, economic war,” said Maduro, whose government has been targeted by the United States, European Union and Canada for sanctions over allegations of abusing democracy and rights. Maduro made the announcement during an event shown live on TV, flanked by aides and bankers, to discuss Venezuela’s new petro cryptocurrency. Venezuela’s government similarly re-denominated its currency by knocking off three zeroes a decade ago. Prices in Venezuela rose 6,147 percent in the 12 months through February, according to estimates by the country’s opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists’ figures. Maduro is running for re-election on May 20 in a vote critics say is rigged to extend the socialists’ rule. The opposition coalition is boycotting the vote, though one leader Henri Falcon has broken ranks to run against Maduro. He is promising to dollarize Venezuela’s economy as a way to beat hyperinflation and regain investor confidence. “Amid the biggest economic collapse in the history of Latin America, the government of Nicolas Maduro attempts to hide hyperinflation by knocking zeros off the currency,” said Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan economist and Wall Street analyst working as Falcon’s chief economic adviser.

2018-12-12,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The daughter of India’s richest man got married on Wednesday in a traditional ceremony in Mumbai attended by Bollywood stars and former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The marriage brings together two of India’s most influential families. The bride, Isha Ambani, 27, is the daughter of Mukesh Ambani, head of the vast Reliance conglomerate whose net worth Forbes put at $43 billion. Her groom, Anand Piramal, 33, is heir to a real-estate and pharmaceutical business.  The wedding bash took place at Ambani’s Mumbai residence, an extraordinary  27-storey structure known as one of the most expensive homes in the world. It was covered in red roses and decorated with lights and flowers for the occasion. The groom and his family arrived in vintage cars as security guards onlookers and photographers from the narrow lane in south Mumbai that leads to the residence.      India’s Filmfare magazine said 600 guests were expected at what media have dubbed the “the big, fat Indian wedding”. The festivities were a culmination of lavish pre-wedding celebrations in the desert city of Udaipur over the weekend which featured a private concert by American singer Beyonce. As well as Clinton, who according to Indian media reports has an association with the Ambanis that goes back more than 18 years, attendees included newly-weds actress Priyanka Chopra and singer Nick Jonas, former Indian finance minister P. Chidambaram, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood actor Aamir Khan. Many in India, where millions of people live in dire poverty, have closely followed the wedding preparations, including the couple’s engagement at a luxury hotel on Italy’s Lake Como.

2018-09-09,"The world’s fourth-largest chemicals maker said in January it was buying a 24.99 percent stake from activist investors, rescuing Clariant from a hostile takeover threat. However, gaining a regulatory nod from countries including Mexico and Brazil has pushed back closure of SABIC’s stock purchase by nine months.  But with this roadblock now cleared, Clariant Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann plans a strategic update to tell shareholders how the combination will work. SABIC sees Clariant as a stepping stone to diversifying its portfolio, which relies on commodity chemicals like fertilizers and polymers. Kottmann meanwhile aims to capitalize on opportunities in SABIC’s 50-plus country network, to not only boost sales but reap savings on raw materials costs. When the transaction closes on Thursday, SABIC will become Clariant’s biggest shareholder, ahead of a German family group that has held about 14 percent since selling holdings in Bavarian-based Sued-Chemie in 2011.  The size and reach of the Saudis — SABIC has $40 billion annual sales, six times Clariant’s revenue — could help the Swiss company lower costs for materials for its products, which include fire retardants which are dropped to tackle forest blazes and catalysts to speed up chemical reactions. “On the sourcing side, Clariant could really benefit,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Philipp Gamper said. “With its extensive business connections it will also open up sales opportunities.” Clariant shares were up 1.3 percent at 1100 GMT. They have fallen 12.7 percent this year, as the arrival of SABIC as an anchor shareholder dented hopes of a takeover or break-up.  SABIC shares, which have risen by about 17 percent this year, were down 1 percent. While SABIC has said it has no plans to buy a majority holding, its deepening union with Clariant has prompted speculation that managers in Riyadh will eventually assert more control. Sources have said no move is imminent, although SABIC is unlikely to just sit on its 25 percent holding.  SABIC has long been a Clariant customer and the two have a plant design joint venture called Scientific Design, which generates shared revenue of about $80 million annually.  Yousef Al-Benyan, SABIC’s CEO said the companies knew each other and had worked well together for many years. “This investment is in line with SABIC’s strategy of product diversification...and becoming a global leader in the specialties sector,” he said.

2018-07-25,"The world’s biggest smartphone-chip maker and Netherlands-based NXP confirmed in separate statements on Thursday that the deal, which would have been the biggest semiconductor takeover globally, had been terminated.  The collapse of the deal is likely to aggravate tensions between Washington and Beijing, damage China’s image as an antitrust regulator and discourage deals that need Chinese approval to go through, sources have said. “I’m very disappointed that they didn’t get regulatory approval,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. “Unfortunately, I think this is another example of where it was approved in every single other territory. We’re just looking for U.S. companies to be treated fairly.” Qualcomm had said on Wednesday that it would drop the bid for NXP, unless a last minute reprieve from China was received. There was no word from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), the antitrust regulator reviewing the deal, after the deadline for the deal to expire passed. “We obviously got caught up in something that was above us,” Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said in an interview after the announcement on Wednesday.  The deal was announced in October 2016, just days before the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and was awaiting Chinese approval even as a trade dispute between United States and China intensified and the two countries clashed on issues such as ownership of technology and patents. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who had been critical of ZTE, in a post on Twitter blasted China’s action against Qualcomm, saying: “We should reimpose ZTE ban.” Qualcomm needed approval from China because the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue last year. The Chinese Commerce Ministry declined on Thursday to comment on whether the deal was approved.     “According to my understanding, the case was an anti-monopoly issue, and not related to China-U.S. trade friction,” ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular news conference. He said that while China does not want a trade war, it is not afraid of one. While the collapse of the deal will remove a big overhang from Qualcomm’s stock, it will leave it on the hook to find new ways to turbocharge growth as global phone sales slow. But it cited progress on one of two major patent royalty conflicts, thought to be with Chinese phonemaker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Of the $700 million due to Qualcomm as part of an interim agreement, $500 million was paid this quarter. Intel and Apple declined to comment. A spokesman for Huawei said the company would not comment on speculation. “We think moving on, reducing the amount of uncertainty in the business and increasing the focus is the right thing to do with the company,” Mollenkopf said. For now, Qualcomm will buy back $30 billion in shares if the deal fails, making good on a promise to reassure investors. The San Diego chipmaker on Wednesday also delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter results and a rosy outlook for so-called 5G technology, the next generation of wireless data networks. The company’s shares rose about 7 percent in premarket trading, while those of NXP fell 6.5 percent.  Qualcomm will pay NXP $2 billion in termination fee by 09:00 ET on July 26, as agreed. “We believe ending the uncertainty of buying NXP is positive for Qualcomm shares,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a note to clients. He said he expects strong earnings growth over the next several years thanks to the share buyback, the likelihood that the disputes with Apple and Huawei will be settled over the next year, and that 5G will drive market share gains.

2018-02-28,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel is exploring merger and sale options for its mobile towers businesses as Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal seeks to get out of the infrastructure game and focus on connectivity. Airtel, the world’s No.3 mobile operator by subscribers, also wants to float a minority stake in its African operations and sees the London Stock Exchange as a potentially attractive venue. Mittal, briefing reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Wednesday, backed the lead set by telcos in the United States, now being followed in Europe, for specialists to roll up and run mobile tower assets. “Our position is very clear: towers are steel and concrete. They are not the domain of mobile companies,” said the 60-year-old Mittal, whose family fortune Forbes Magazine puts at $8.8 billion. His move to shed non-core assets follows the blockbuster entry into the Indian market by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio that has forced rivals to merge, creating a three big players in the country of 1.3 billion people. Indian operators, despite their strapped finances, will need to prepare for the launch of fifth-generation services, and Mittal said he expected Bharti Airtel to continue to commit $3-$4 billion a year to capex. India will roll out 5G “in step” with other parts of the world, he said, with first use cases likely to be industry applications, and in fixed-line and machine-to-machine communication. Bharti Airtel controls Bharti Infratel Ltd, and also owns 42 percent stake in Indus Towers Ltd, India’s largest mobile infrastructure company with nearly 123,000 towers. Bharti Infratel said last October it was considering buying the rest of Indus that is owned by competitors Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which are in the process of merging. Mittal said he had a flexible approach to exiting the towers business, and had also received board approval to pursue the alternative of reducing Bharti’s stake in Infratel to below majority control. “We have gone down from 100 percent to 53 percent. And our board has decided: if you want to go and sell, then sell,” said Mittal, who also chairs the GSMA industry group that hosts the annual Barcelona gathering. Bharti Airtel, present in 20 countries, said in mid-February that it was exploring an initial public offering for Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V. (BAIN), the holding company that owns its African interests. A listing, if it does happen, would only be of a minority stake, said Mittal: “It will remain a Bharti subsidiary. That means we are staying (in Africa).” Vice-Chairman Akhil Gupta said London was a potentially good venue but that Bharti would rely on the advice of investment bankers, yet to be appointed for the deal, before making up its mind. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has said BAIN could be valued at an enterprise value of $6.6 billion, or six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Gupta said he was looking for a higher price. “I think we should be much more, because we should be at $1.2 billion of EBITDA by the time (of the float),” he said. “But the markets will decide all this.” Reporting by Douglas Busvine.

2018-10-12,"NEW YORK/DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is convinced that jailed photographer Shahidul Alam instigated trouble by spreading what she describes as “false news” about protests against her rule in August.  In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Hasina described Alam, who is known as one of South Asia’s preeminent photographers, as “mentally sick” and blamed his behavior on his family background – Alam’s great uncle was on the opposing side to Hasina’s father in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan. She offered no evidence for her accusations, which Alam’s family and lawyer reject.  Alam was arrested in August, hours after criticizing the government’s response to widespread student protests.  His detention has been widely seen as a test for freedom of speech in the country and has sparked worldwide demands for his release. Hasina, who was returned unopposed in 2014 after the opposition boycotted the poll, is seeking a third term in an election at the end of December against a backdrop of growing dissent at what critics believe is her increasingly authoritarian government. “You are now guilty until proven innocent - we have a reverse system,” said Ataur Rahman, a professor of political science at Dhaka University. “People don’t want to be engaged in debates in case they end up like Shahidul.” Told of Hasina’s comments, Alam’s family said the government had already decided on his guilt before a trial can be held. “It shows they have already made their judgment,” said Alam’s niece, Dilruba Karim. She added that Hasina’s comments “are hugely cruel and don’t befit the leader of a so-called democracy”. Anisul Huq, a cabinet minister who handles legal affairs in Hasina’s government, said the country’s judicial system has “full independence and freedom”.  Alam, a long-term critic of Hasina’s Awami League, is being investigated under a controversial section of the Information and Communication Technology Act, which Human Rights Watch says has been used by Hasina’s government in a number of arbitrary detentions of government critics and is one of several laws that have been used to stifle free speech. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has called the case “rife with due process violations”, an accusation that Huq denied. Alam’s lawyer, Shahdeen Malik, said his comments during the protests did not constitute a criminal offence, and that Hasina’s remarks regarding Alam’s uncle suggested a “feudal” justice system.  Hasina’s government has also introduced laws that prescribe jail time for those spreading “propaganda” against the country, while her main political rival, Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Khaleda Zia, is in jail on corruption charges she claims were part of a plot to prevent her from challenging Hasina. The government firmly denies it has interfered with freedom of speech. “No government has safeguarded and upheld principles of freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of press as much as this government of Hasina has done,” Huq said. Alam was detained for what the government says was misleading reporting on the demonstrations, that began because of the deaths of two school students in a traffic accident before escalating into the widest anti-government protests in years. Alam says he was covering the demonstrations as a photojournalist. In one of a dozen Facebook videos he posted from the protest site, Alam said he had been attacked and had his camera smashed by “goons” wielding metal rods and sticks from the Chhatra League, a student movement affiliated with the ruling Awami League. He later posted a photograph he said showed men from the movement wearing masks and being allowed to disrupt the protests in full view of police officers. Biplob Barua, a senior leader in the Awami League, said the allegations made by Alam in the Facebook videos about attacks on students and the failure of the police to act were “totally false” and had provoked additional violence. Photographs of protesters being attacked by young men are widely available online but Reuters could not verify what group the assailants belonged to. Alam was picked up hours after giving an interview to Al Jazeera in which he accused the government of involvement in extrajudicial killings in the past. The government has denied allegations of sanctioning extrajudicial killings in its controversial anti-drugs campaign. Hasina said in the interview with Reuters in New York late last month that Alam had spread false news as authorities were trying to calm the students. “He tried to use this situation, to instigate it,” she said. “We tried to save the children but he tried to use these children. All the false news he started... how can you accept it?” In the interview, she also sharply criticized Alam’s deceased great uncle, Abdus Sabur Khan, a former government minister who opposed Bangladesh’s independence and allied with Pakistan. “He opposed our liberation war, he joined Pakistan, he didn’t accept Bangladesh. In 1971 he was with the Pakistani occupation army,” Hasina said. “Sometimes blood speaks, you understand that.” The war for independence is still a sensitive topic in the country.  A new law, called the Digital Security Act, signed into law by the nation’s president on Monday despite protests from local journalists and the United States, stipulates a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for several offences, including secretly recording inside government buildings and spreading “propaganda” against Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence. Hasina told Reuters that reporters had nothing to fear from the Digital Security Act. “If they have confidence that they will not do anything wrong then why should they worry,” she said.  Reporting by Jonathan Spicer in NEW YORK and Serajul Quadir in DHAKA; Additional reporting by Saad Sayeed in ISLAMABAD and Rodrigo Campos in NEW YORK; Writing by Alasdair Pal in NEW DELHI; Editing by Martin Howell and Alex Richardson",https://in.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-protests-photographer-hasina/exclusive-bangladesh-pm-takes-aim-at-photographer-critics-say-it-is-part-of-wider-crackdown-idINKCN1MM1TO
2018-10-04,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India deported seven Rohingya Muslim men to Myanmar on Thursday, raising fears of further repatriations among those sheltering in refugee camps in the country, and concern that those returned faced the risk of abuse at the hands of Myanmar authorities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government, which regards them as illegal aliens and a potential security risk, has ordered that Rohingya living in small settlements and slums around the country be identified and deported. The seven men had been in a detention centre in eastern India since 2012 after being arrested for illegal entry, and were handed over to Myanmar, the government said, after India’s top court rejected a plea to halt the deportation. “Today’s decision by the Supreme Court marks a dark day for human rights in India. This decision negates India’s proud tradition of providing refuge to those fleeing serious human rights violations,” said Amnesty India. Around 40,000 Rohingya live in India according to government estimates, most of them in camps, having arrived over the years after fleeing violence and persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which denies them citizenship. Thursday’s expulsion marks the first such move by India and comes at a time when some of the country’s local media have been picking on the Rohingya as troublemakers, engaged in everything from petty crime to acts of terrorism. Television pictures showed the men, their faces covered with handkerchiefs, coming out of a police station in the border town of Moreh before being turned over to Myanmar authorities. Police officers from India and Myanmar exchanged a note that said the men were being repatriated to their “country of origin Myanmar” while the seven sat on a street in Moreh. “We will drive them from this border point and drop them 100 kms from here, and after that it is their responsibility to go to the Rakhine state of Myanmar,” Aung Myo, deputy director of immigration in Myanmar’s Tamu border district told reporters during a televised press briefing. The mother of one of the seven men said she was concerned about his fate.  “We are so worried,” she said, declining to be named for fear of reprisals. She said she was worried the men would be jailed on their return. “We would be so grateful if the Myanmar government sent our sons directly to their homes.” India’s external affairs ministry said in a statement that the men had themselves sought to return to Myanmar in 2016, and the travel documents issued to them would allow them to return to their hometowns in Rakhine state.  Myanmar’s government spokesman, Zaw Htay, did not answer telephone calls on Thursday from Reuters seeking comment on the handover of the men. Last month, he said he would no longer speak to the media over the phone but only at a biweekly conference. A U.N. report in August accused the Myanmar military of committing mass killings and rapes on the Rohingya with “genocidal intent” last year in an operation that forced more than 700,000 of them to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.  Myanmar has denied the charges, saying its military launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Muslim militants in August last year. International rights groups said the deportation violates international law, and the U.N.’s refugee agency said conditions in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, from where the Rohingya have fled, are not safe for their return.  Mohammed Salimullah, a Rohingya in India who had challenged the government order in court, said India’s decision to send the seven men to Myanmar was a shock.  “It would have been better if they had been kept in jail rather than being sent back to Myanmar.” At a small makeshift Rohingya refugee camp in New Delhi, home to about 40 families, there was alarm over Thursday’s  deportation. For many packed into a cluster of ramshackle huts, India was a safe zone. “India is like a slice of heaven to me,” said Mohammed Salim, 32, sitting by a plastic sheet that doubles up as the door to his house, as naked children crowded around an ice cream vendor outside. “I’m safe here. My children can study here. I can find work.”   An Indian flag stood tall on a pole in the middle of the camp. In Myanmar, Salim said he wasn’t safe. Most refugees said they did not want to return because they didn’t believe they could live there peacefully. In India, many Rohingya have identity cards issued by the U.N.’s refugee agency which it says prevents them from arbitrary arrests, harassment and deportation.  At a camp in the northern state of Jammu & Kashmir too there was fear the authorities would be coming to take them away.   “Today they have expelled seven, tomorrow they can expel all of us,” said Syed Alam, a refugee there. He said he was deeply troubled by the news. “India doesn’t know what happens with Rohingya inside Myanmar. Can it not see what Myanmar has done to our people in the last year?” India has been tight-lipped about Myanmar military’s actions on the Rohingya, and struck a deal with Myanmar in December to help rebuild Rakhine State, from where the Rohingya have fled.  In a bid to counter China’s influence in the region as part of its ‘Look East’ policy, India has deepened its security ties with Myanmar in recent months, and welcomed Myanmar’s army chief Min Aung Hlaing this July to the country to discuss security in the border region.

2018-12-05,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday expressed confidence in striking a trade deal with the United States within their 90-day ceasefire period, praising the recent meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as highly successful. In Argentina last weekend, Trump and Xi agreed to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. hike of tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal. “We are very confident in reaching an agreement (with the United States) within the next 90 days,” China’s commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said in a weekly briefing, adding both sides have been communicating and cooperating “smoothly” since the leaders met in Argentina. China’s ultimate goal during the 90-day trade talks is to remove all U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, Gao said. His comments come as the arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei by Canadian authorities, on Washington’s request, threatens to spark a flare-up in tensions between the world’s two economic powerhouses once again.  The two countries have hit each other with tit-for-tariffs on goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars in sectors from automobiles to agriculture and energy, stymying trade and redrawing global supply chains. Gao confirmed for the first time since the high-stakes meeting that China had agreed to implement consensus reached by both sides on agriculture, energy and cars, although he did not give details on any specific measures.  “We will start with agricultural products, energy, automobiles to immediately implement the issues that the two sides have reached consensus,” Gao said, when asked about what is on the negotiation agenda.  “Then, in the next 90 days, we will follow a clear timetable and roadmap to negotiate on issues such as intellectual property right protection, tech cooperation, market access and trade balance,” he said, stressing the consultations should be based on meeting the interests of both parties. The White House has said China had committed to start buying more American products and lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers immediately, while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection. The United States has levied additional duties of between 10 percent and 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods this year as punishment for what it calls China’s unfair trade practices. China has responded with its own tariffs. “China and United States have reached very important consensus as both sides’ interests overlap,” Gao said. His comments echoed earlier remarks made by senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi, who said the meeting was “friendly and candid” and would help to avoid further trade tensions. “All of these help to safeguard China’s legitimate interests, and are also in the interests of the United States, and even more are in line with the expectations of the international community,” he added in a statement carried on the foreign ministry’s website. But global markets have been nervous about the prospects of a Sino-U.S. trade dispute spilling over to growing rivalry between both sides in areas such as technology, and many economists have remained cautious about being too optimistic on a temporary truce. The daughter of Huawei’s founder is facing extradition to the United States, dealing a blow to hopes of an easing of Sino-U.S. trade tensions and rocking global stock markets. Trump also warned this week of more tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences. Hannah Anderson, Global Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said there was a lot of uncertainty over the U.S.-China relationship now as both view each other more as a competitor than a strategic partner in trade and economics. “When it comes to the trade policies that have been proposed so far specifically, I think we can all expect that there will be further tariff increases on U.S. imports of Chinese goods, whether that’s within the 90-day window that we are now operating under a pause or outside that window,” Anderson told a small group of reporters in Beijing on Thursday.

2018-12-14," (The Dec. 14 story corrects description of company to say engineering firm and clarifies the nature of its involvement in project in ninth paragraph) By Shilpa Jamkhandikar MUMBAI (Reuters) - As the celebrations from what many in India are calling the wedding of the year wind down, all eyes are now turning to the multi-million dollar mansion that Isha Ambani, the daughter of India’s richest man will move into with husband, Anand Piramal. The 50,000 square-foot mansion, which stands in the swanky locality of Worli in South Mumbai and has sweeping views of the Arabian Sea and the Sea-Link bridge is still a step down for the bride, given her father’s home is more than eight times that size. Isha’s father is Mukesh Ambani, a telecom and petroleum magnate whose net worth is pegged at $43 billion, and whose 27-floor, 400,000 square foot Tetris-tower-like residence is a prominent structure on the Mumbai skyline.  It was in that house that Isha got married to Anand Piramal on Wednesday, the culmination of week-long celebrations that included a private concert by U.S. singer Beyonce. The wedding was described by some as a mini-Davos summit, as it was attended by two former U.S. secretaries of state, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, along with Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih, private equity doyens Stephen Schwarzman and Henry Kravis, CPPIB CEO Mark Machin, and WPP Founder Martin Sorrell, along with dozens of Bollywood celebrities. After the wedding, Indian media reported that, Isha, 27 and Anand, 33, would move into Gulita, a 50,000 square foot mansion that the groom’s parents gave them as a wedding present. The Piramals, who have interests in real estate and pharma, bought the property, previously owned by Hindustan Unilver, at a reported price of $62 million in 2012.  Marked by a stunning glass facade and three glazed steel structures, Gulita has seen hectic remodelling work in the months leading up to the wedding. The largest of the steel structures is 11 metres tall and it was constructed using 3D modelling tools, according to Eckersley OCallaghan, a London-based engineering firm which was involved in the project. The Mumbai Mirror newspaper reported that the house has three basements, multiple dining rooms and an outdoor pool. Many in India, where tens of millions live in dire poverty, have followed the wedding, for its dazzling display of wealth and influence.  Isha’s twin brother, Akash, is set to marry fiancée Shloka Mehta early next year.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA has shipped a crude cargo valued at $35 million as partial payment to Indian oil company ONGC Videsh Ltd for overdue dividends from a joint venture, according to two people familiar with the matter. But Caracas-based PDVSA had not transferred any money to ONGC Videsh in over a year, the sources said, due to Venezuela’s economic meltdown and sanctions that complicate payments through U.S. banks that had made it difficult to pay in cash.  That changed when some 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude left Venezuela’s main oil port of Jose earlier in October, according to one of the sources. “ONGC Videsh confirms that in October 2018 PDVSA has allocated Merey 16 crude oil parcel of 500,000 barrels to ONGC Videsh towards payment of outstanding dividend,” ONGC Videsh said in an email reply to Reuters. It was not immediately clear which tanker was carrying the crude. Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) Iwatesan and Kassab set sail from Jose several weeks ago with India’s Sikka port as their destination, according to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data. PDVSA, which faces U.S. and international court actions over pending debts, recently has begun paying some creditors, mostly in oil, to avoid further asset seizures. The company is also seeking to stimulate investment in Venezuela’s unraveling oil industry, where annual production is at its lowest in almost seven decades, by trying to meet some of its obligations to foreign partners.       Reliance will receive the Venezuelan crude and will ultimately pay the $35 million to ONGC, according to one of the sources. Venezuela depends on oil for almost all its export revenue. The combination of falling crude production and exports from a lack of investment, U.S. sanctions and hyperinflation have pushed the OPEC-member country’s economy to near-collapse.   ONGC had previously received $89 million from PDVSA as part of the 2016 payment agreement, reducing the outstanding debt to about $440 million, but no other transfers had been received in more than a year. These payments were made by Russia’s state-run Gazprombank in January 2017 and by Reliance in April 2017. [nL1N1NE2AA] ONGC Videsh Managing Director N. K. Verma said in May that PDVSA had halted all payments to the firm for more than six months. [nL2N1T2159] “Since the (payment) process has again started, we hope to receive more such parcels in India to clear outstanding dues,” one of the sources said. Reliance and PDVSA did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. The Venezuelan state-run firm this week started transferring payments to holders of its 2020 bonds, which are backed by collateral in its Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] refining arm, after shifting its export logistics during the third quarter to raise more cash.

2018-11-03,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A week of fighting between Taliban militants and fighters loyal to a commander from the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority has heightened fears of a dangerous new phase of sectarian violence in Afghanistan. The clashes in the central province of Uruzgan, which have killed at least 21 people, have highlighted concerns that Hazaras, members of a mainly Shi’ite Persian-speaking minority targeted by Islamic State attacks over recent years, may take up arms in frustration at a lack of action by the government. While the Taliban, made up mainly of ethnic Pashtun Sunni Muslims, has not explicitly targeted Hazaras in the past, officials fear the violence could escalate into an ethnic battle.  “The fighting is very intense and is now becoming an issue of ethnic violence between Hazara and Pashtun,” said Amir Mohammad Barekzai, the provincial council chief. “The government must arrange a truce between them or there will be a massacre.” Sectarian violence had until recent years been relatively uncommon in Afghanistan but suicide bombings at Shi’ite mosques and cultural centres by Islamic State as well as attacks on Hazaras travelling on provincial highways have fuelled growing anger. Many Hazaras blame Sunni Pashtuns for the attacks. Afghan and Western security officials, fearing the kind of sectarian violence that has devastated Iraq, have been deeply concerned that Hazaras who fought in Iranian-backed militias in Syria could hit Sunni targets. The recent violence started when Taliban fighters attacked a remote cluster of Hazara villages in Uruzgan province after they refused to pay tax to the insurgents, provincial officials said. The Hazara commander, Abdul Hakim Shujaee, a former leader in the U.S.-funded Afghan Local Police, has been accused of serious human rights abuses and faces an arrest order from the central government, which has struggled to impose its authority on remote parts of the country. He commands hundreds of Hazara fighters and remains free because of his connections with powerful political figures in Kabul, local officials say. Uruzgan, squeezed between the Taliban heartlands of Kandahar and Helmand and the Hazara-dominated province of Daikondi, is home to both Pashtuns and Hazara families and the two groups have long had an uneasy co-existence. Asadullah Sayed, the governor of Uruzgan, said fighting broke out between two armed groups in three villages of Khas Uruzgan district last week and government forces have been deployed to end the conflict. He put the number of dead at 21 but a government security official said 43 people had been killed so far on both sides, many more wounded and some 300 families have fled the area. The Taliban normally collect taxes from local residents in areas under their control to fund their insurgency but Hazara families defied them, setting off a fierce gun battle, he said. The case echoes a standoff last month in central Ghor province involving a prominent Hazara commander called Alipur, known as “Commander Sword”, seen by supporters as a kind of Robin Hood figure but denounced by the government as a bandit.

2018-10-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about one percent on Tuesday on growing evidence of falling Iranian crude exports before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions, as well as a partial production shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael.  Brent crude futures rose $1.09 to settle at $85.00 a barrel, a 1.30 percent gain. The global benchmark hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week but slipped as low as $82.66 on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 67 cents to settle at $74.96 a barrel, a 0.90 percent gain. Iran’s crude exports fell further in the first week of October, according to tanker data and an industry source, as buyers sought alternatives ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, exported 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in that seven-day period, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. An industry source who also tracks exports said October shipments so far were below 1 million bpd. That is down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before U.S. President Donald Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions. The figure also marks a further fall from 1.6 million bpd in September. A vessel carrying 2 million barrels of Iranian oil discharged the crude into a bonded storage tank at the port of Dalian in northeast China on Monday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and a shipping agent with knowledge of the matter. The country previously held oil in storage at Dalian during the last round of sanctions in 2014 that was later sold to buyers in South Korea and India.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, last week said it would increase crude output next month to 10.7 million bpd, a record. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday described a Saudi claim that the kingdom could replace Iran’s crude exports as “nonsense.” “There is growing concern that suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia will struggle to compensate for potential production declines from Iran and Venezuela, which has supported oil prices in today’s trading session,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Meanwhile, producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday cut oil production by about 40 percent as Hurricane Michael approached the Florida coast, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said, citing reports from 27 companies. If forecasts prove accurate, the hurricane would largely miss major oil-producing assets, analysts said, but a change of track could widen the impact. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying trade tensions and rising import tariffs were taking a toll on commerce while emerging markets struggle with tighter financial conditions and capital outflows.  Industry and government data on U.S. crude inventories will be delayed by one day this week because of Monday’s U.S. Columbus Day holiday. The American Petroleum Institute is due to release data on Wednesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to publish on Thursday.

2018-11-23,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped up to nearly 8 percent to the lowest in more than a year on Friday, posting the seventh consecutive weekly loss, amid intensifying fears of a supply glut even as major producers consider cutting output. Oil supply, led by U.S. producers, is growing faster than demand and to prevent a build-up of unused fuel such as the one that emerged in 2015, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to start trimming output after a meeting on Dec. 6. But this has done little so far to prop up prices, which have dropped more than 20 percent so far in November, in a seven-week streak of losses. Prices were on course for their biggest one-month decline since late 2014. A trade war between the world’s two biggest economies and oil consumers, the United States and China, has weighed upon the market.  “The market is pricing in an economic slowdown - they are anticipating that the Chinese trade talks are not going to go well,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, referring to expected talks next week between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.  “The market doesn’t believe that OPEC is going to be able to act swiftly enough to offset the coming slowdown in demand,” Flynn said.  Brent crude futures settled down $3.80 a barrel, or 6.1 percent at $58.80. During the session, the benchmark dropped to $58.41, the lowest since October 2017.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) lost $4.21, or 7.7 percent, to trade at $50.42, also the weakest since October 2017. In post-settlement trade, the contract continued to fall.  For the week, Brent fell 11.3 percent and WTI posted a 10.8 percent decline, the largest one-week drop since January 2016.  Market fears over weak demand intensified after China reported its lowest gasoline exports in more than a year amid a glut of the fuel in Asia and globally. Stockpiles of gasoline have surged across Asia, with inventories in Singapore, the regional refining hub, rising to a three-month high while Japanese stockpiles also climbed last week. Inventories in the United States are about 7 percent higher than a year ago.     Crude production has soared as well this year. The International Energy Agency expects non-OPEC output alone to rise by 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) this year while demand next year was expected to grow 1.3 million bpd.  Adjusting to lower demand, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that it may reduce supply as it pushes OPEC to agree to a joint output cut of 1.4 million bpd. However, Trump has made it clear that he does not want oil prices to rise and many analysts think Saudi Arabia is coming under U.S. pressure to resist calls from other OPEC members for lower crude output. If OPEC decides to cut production at its meeting next month, oil prices could recover, analysts say. “We expect that OPEC will manage the market in 2019 and assess the probability of an agreement to reduce production at around 2-in-3. In that scenario, Brent prices likely recover back into the $70s,” Morgan Stanley commodities strategists Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant wrote in a note to clients. If OPEC does not trim production, prices could head much lower, potentially depreciating toward $50 a barrel, argues Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM. VOLATILITY SPIKES TO 2-YEAR HIGH By the middle of November, commodity trading advisory funds tracked by Credit Suisse prime services had dropped 1.5 percent on the month, owing to the losses in energy futures and the increased volatility. Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse, told Reuters this week that the action among macro and CTA funds reflects a risk-aversion trade, as net long positions have dropped from near five-year highs to roughly even exposure between longs and shorts.       Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long positions in Brent by 32,263 contracts to 182,569 in the week ended Nov. 20, according to data provided by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) on Friday. That’s the lowest net long position since December 2015. Volatility, a measure of investor demand for options, has spiked to its highest since late 2016, above 60 percent, as investors have rushed to buy protection against further steep price declines. The decline in oil prices pulled U.S. energy shares lower.  Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp fell more than 3 percent and were the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Oilfield service providers Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co also fell nearly 3 percent. additional reporting by Christopher Johnson and Amanda Cooper in London, and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Marguerita Choy and Susan Thomas",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-plunges-nearly-8-percent-despite-talk-of-output-cut-idINKCN1NS012

2018-06-28," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports of Iranian oil from November, two industry sources said, the first sign that New Delhi is responding to a push by the United States to cut trade ties with Iran. India has said it does not recognise unilateral restrictions imposed by the United States, and instead follows U.N. sanctions. But the industry sources said India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, will be forced to take action to protect its exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s oil ministry held a meeting with refiners on Thursday, urging them to scout for alternatives to Iranian oil, the sources said. “(India) has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all,” said one of the sources, who has knowledge of the matter. Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in Mumbai that the country would attend to its interests while deciding on oil imports.  “We know (that) to have a healthy energy mix, we can get oil from anywhere. The rest depends on geopolitics, and those decisions will be taken based on the situations,” he said. “We will go by our interests. When we decide anything on Iran, we will inform you.” During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked due to the European and U.S. sanctions. The source said this time the situation is different. “You have India, China and Europe on one side, and U.S. on the other... At this moment we really don’t know what to do, but at the same time we have to prepare ourselves to face any eventuality,” said the source. Haley, currently in Delhi, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting Modi. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Indian Oil Corp, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd and Nayara Energy, the top three Indian buyers of Iranian oil, did not respond to Reuters’s request for comments.  The second source said there were plenty of options available in the market to replace Iranian oil. “There are companies and traders that are willing to give you a 60 day credit, crude is available in the market,” the source said. To boost its sales to India, Iran recently offered virtually free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. “We can buy Basra Heavy, Saudi or Kuwait oil to replace Iran. Finding replacement barrels is not a problem, but it has to give the best economic value,” a third source in New Delhi said.

2018-12-27,"MUMBAI/DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India through the local unit of Foxconn as early as 2019, the first time the Taiwanese contract manufacturer will have made the product in the country, according to a source familiar with the matter. Importantly, Foxconn will be assembling the most expensive models, such as devices in the flagship iPhone X family, the source said, potentially taking Apple’s business in India to a new level. The work will take place at Foxconn’s plant in Sriperumbudur town in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the source, who is not authorised to speak to the media and so declined to be named. Foxconn, which already makes phones for Xiaomi Corp in India, will invest 25 billion Indian rupees ($356 million) to expand the plant, including investment in iPhone production, Tamil Nadu’s Industries Minister M C Sampath told Reuters. The investment may create as many as 25,000 jobs, he added. Another source also said Foxconn planned to assemble iPhones in India, in a move that could help both it and Apple to limit  the impact of a trade war between the United States and China.  The Hindu newspaper first reported on Dec. 24 that the Foxconn plant would begin manufacturing various models of the iPhone. Reuters is first to report the size of the investment and the kind of phones to be assembled. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Foxconn said it did not comment on matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products. LOWER-END PHONES Until now, Cupertino, California-based Apple has only assembled the lower-cost SE and 6S models in India through Wistron Corp’s local unit in the Bengaluru technology hub. Its sales in India have also been focused on lower-end phones - more than half of its sales volume is driven by models older than the iPhone 8, launched last year, according to technology research firm Counterpoint. Apple launched the pricey iPhone X last year but has cut production of that phone, according to industry analysts, since it began selling the newer versions, iPhone XS and XR, globally this year. Still, it could potentially get Foxconn to make the older iPhone X version in India where it sells cheaper models in a bid to get a bigger share of the world’s fastest growing major mobile phone market. Full details of Apple’s deal with Foxconn are not yet clear and could change.  It is not known if any of the iPhone assembly is being moved from existing Foxconn factories in China and elsewhere. It is also unclear whether the production will be confined to assembly or include any component production in India. For Apple, widening assembly beyond China is critical to mitigate the risks of the Sino-U.S. trade war. Foxconn, the world’s biggest electronics contract manufacturer, is considering setting up a factory in Vietnam, Vietnamese state media reported this month. If that goes ahead, it will be one of the biggest recent steps by a major company to secure an additional production base outside of China. Foxconn has previously admitted the China-U.S. trade spat was its biggest challenge and that its senior executives were making plans to counter the impact. “Widening iPhone manufacturing in India through Foxconn will allow Apple to hedge the risk of any new U.S. trade policies,” said Navkendar Singh, an associate research director at International Data Corporation. Indian taxes on import of devices and components have also heightened Apple’s headache in a market where it has only a 1 percent share by smartphone shipments. Making more phones locally will help Apple save costly duties and boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship drive to make India a manufacturing hub, Singh said. Apple shocked investors last month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world. Foxconn has previously expressed concern over demand for Apple’s flagship devices.

2018-12-05,"The details being made public were just the “tip of the iceberg” investigators said, and the latest revelations were the strongest international links yet announced to the sweeping “Car Wash” probe centred on political corruption at Petrobras. Petrobras employees offered the trading companies lower prices for oil and its derivatives as well as storage tanks in more than 160 separate operations then shared in the savings, authorities said.  Those involved, emails obtained by Brazil’s federal police showed, would use nicknames such as Tiger, Flipper or Mr M and discuss below-market prices for oil or tanks, while invoicing their companies at the market rate. The differences could range from 10 cents to a dollar per barrel and the term of art for the bribes was “delta.” Prosecutors also obtained spreadsheets mentioning oil trades involving Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura that they said represent the bribes paid.  “Evidence shows that there was a scheme in which the companies investigated paid bribes to Petrobras employees to obtain ... more advantageous prices and sign contracts more frequently,” prosecutors said in a statement.  The bribes moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, among others, raising questions of whether those countries would open investigations. Brazilian police alerted Interpol, seeking the arrest of a Petrobras employee in Houston, whom the company said it has now fired. The employee, Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, worked as an oil trader, and prosecutors say he used the nickname Batman.  Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of corruption. “We are the most interested party in seeing all the facts come to light,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue adopting all necessary measures to obtain a proper reparation for damages caused (to Petrobras).”  Spokesmen for Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment. A Vitol spokesman said the firm “has a zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption and will always cooperate fully with the relevant authorities in any jurisdiction in which it operates.”     More than 130 businessmen and politicians have been convicted in the case in Brazil, including former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence.  The latest developments hit just as Petrobras was hoping to turn the page on corruption. In September, Petrobras settled corruption charges for $850 million with Brazilian and U.S. authorities.  Separately on Wednesday it launched a new business plan saying its goal is to “strengthen the credibility, pride and reputation of Petrobras.” The latest Car Wash chapter could undermine Petrobras’ deals and ability to embark on privatisation plans that far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s economic team wants to carry out. Petrobras said a month ago it is selling its 50 percent stake in a Nigerian oil and gas exploration venture to a consortium led by Vitol for $1.53 billion as the state-controlled oil company reduces debt. The deal has not yet closed and it was unclear how Wednesday’s action may affect it.  It was not the first time prosecutors have zeroed in on Trafigura, a commodities trader based in Geneva.  In March, a former Trafigura executive, Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, was found guilty of bribing a Petrobras executive on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was sentenced to more than 10 years in jail. Ferraz was also involved in the scheme unveiled on Wednesday, prosecutors said. Swiss prosecutors also have an open investigation, announced one month after Ferraz’s arrest in Brazil in 2016. The Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland began a criminal probe into an employee of Trafigura as part of a wider investigation into suspected corruption at Petrobras. It did not identify the employee.

2018-05-06,"HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips has moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over a decade-oil nationalization of its projects in the South American country, according to three sources familiar with its actions. The U.S. firm targeted facilities on the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius that accounted for about a quarter of Venezuela’s oil exports last year. The three play key roles in processing, storing and blending PDVSA’s oil for export.  The company received court attachments freezing assets at least two of the facilities, and could move to sell them, one of the sources said.  Conoco’s legal maneuvers could further impair PDVSA’s declining oil revenue and the country’s convulsing economy. Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil exports, which have fallen by a third since its peak and its refineries ran at just 31 percent of capacity in the first quarter.  The Latin American country is in the grip of a deep recession with severe shortages of medicine and food as well as a growing exodus of its people.  PDVSA and the Venezuelan foreign ministry did not respond on Sunday to requests for comment. Dutch authorities said they are assessing the situation on Bonaire.       Conoco’s claims against Venezuela and state-run PDVSA in international courts have totaled $33 billion, the largest by any company.  “Any potential impacts on communities are the result of PDVSA’s illegal expropriation of our assets and its decision to ignore the judgment of the ICC tribunal,” Conoco said in an email to Reuters.     The U.S firm added it will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions. PDVSA has significant assets in the Caribbean. On Bonaire, it owns the 10-million-barrel BOPEC terminal which handles logistics and fuel shipments to customers, particularly in Asia. In Aruba, PDVSA and its unit Citgo lease a refinery and a storage terminal.  On the island of St. Eustatius, it rents storage tanks at the Statia terminal, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where over 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude were retained by court order, according to one of the sources.  NuStar is aware of the order and “assessing our legal and commercial options,” said spokesman Chris Cho. The company does not expect the matter to change its earnings outlook, he said.  Conoco also sought to attach PDVSA inventories on Curacao, home of the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery and Bullenbay oil terminal. But the order could not immediately be enforced, according to two of the sources. Last year, PDVSA’s shipments from Bonaire and St Eustatius terminals accounted for about 10 percent of its total exports, according to internal figures from the state-run company. The exports were mostly crude and fuel oil for Asian customers including ChinaOil, China’s Zhenhua Oil and India’s Reliance Industries. From its largest Caribbean operations in Curacao, PDVSA shipped 14 percent of its exports last year, including products exported by its Isla refinery to Caribbean islands and crude from its Bullenbay terminal to buyers of Venezuelan crude all over the world.  PDVSA on Friday ordered its oil tankers sailing across the Caribbean to return to Venezuelan waters and await further instructions, according to a document viewed by Reuters. In the last year, several cargoes of Venezuelan crude have been retained or seized in recent years over unpaid freight fees and related debts. “This is terrible (for PDVSA),” said a source familiar with the court order of attachment. The state-run company “cannot comply with all the committed volume for exports” and the Conoco action imperils its ability to ship fuel oil to China or access inventories to be exported from Bonaire.       At the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from two oil producing joint ventures, which were nationalized in 2007 under late Venezuela President Hugo Chavez. The U.S. firm left the country after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA.  A separate arbitration case involving the loss of its Venezuelan assets is before a World Bank tribunal, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Exxon Mobil Corp also has brought two separate arbitration claims over the 2007 nationalization of its projects in Venezuela.

2018-07-12,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China is preparing to give swift regulatory approvals to India-manufactured drugs, the head of an Indian export promotion group said, as Beijing looks for new commercial partners ahead of what could be a protracted trade war with the United States. Indian firms are looking to fill gaps in Chinese demand for generic drugs, software, sugar and some varieties of rice, trade officials in New Delhi said. “We do feel that China is receptive at this time and it’s all about making prices competitive,” said a government official involved in the effort to promote trade with China. The official declined to be identified since he is not authorised to speak to the media. No concrete deals have been signed but the outlook for  pharmaceutical sales from India is positive, according to officials from both nations. India dominates the world’s generic drugs market, exporting $17.3 billion of drugs in the 2017/18 (April-March) year, including to the United States and the EU. But only 1 percent of that went to China, the world’s second-largest market for pharmaceuticals, industry data shows. Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil), which falls under India’s trade ministry, told Reuters in an interview that Indian firms could expect to win licences to export to China within six months of application. “We understand internally that Chinese authorities have issued instructions that EU-approved Indian suppliers should be granted the industrial drug licence in an expeditious manner so they can enter the Chinese market within six months,” Dua said. Many Indian drug-makers are already selling to the European Union. The EU is already one of India’s key export markets for medicines, and accounted for about 15 percent of overall drug exports in 2016/17, according to Pharmexcil.  Swift regulatory approvals in China would allow Indian companies to boost revenue at a time when pricing scrutiny and regulatory troubles have hurt U.S. sales. Some of India’s largest drugmakers, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Lupin Ltd as well as Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, have been trying for years to expand in the massive Chinese market, which is second only to the United States. Details of Chinese moves to open up its heavily regulated pharmaceuticals sector have not been previously reported. The China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this week that China was moving forward on giving greater market access to Indian drug makers. “China and India are witnessing a growth in pharmaceutical trade, and the two sides are in sound communication on opening the Chinese market to drugs from India and conducting dialogue and co-operation between the two sides’ pharmaceutical industries,” Hua told a regular news conference on Monday. “The relevant departments have formulated specific measures on promoting China-India pharmaceutical trade cooperation and granting greater access to drugs from India. We believe that stronger pharmaceutical trade co-operation will contribute to the well being of the people in our two countries.” In May, China exempted import tariffs on 28 drugs, including all cancer drugs, a move that would help India reduce its trade imbalance with China, Luo Zhaohui, the Chinese ambassador to India said. China has been touting greater access to cancer drugs and pushing to lower prices in a bid to soothe a major social issue in the country, where traditionally many patients with serious illness have had to pay out of their pocket for cutting-edge drugs or have had to buy medicines through unapproved grey market channels. China also lags far behind in terms of drug approvals versus developed markets. The issue was highlighted in a recent film that went viral in China which echoed the U.S. “Dallas Buyers Club” about a Chinese cancer patient who had helped others getting unapproved cancer drugs at lower prices shipped in from India. About 250 product applications from Indian drug firms are pending before the CFDA, some of them for years, an Indian trade ministry official said. Bilateral trade between the two Asian nations touched $89.6 billion in 2017/18 with the trade deficit widening to $62.9 billion in China’s favour, an over nine-fold increase over the last decade. The two sides are discussing ways to increase Indian sales of farm products, including sugar and some varieties of rice, to China. India is also trying to persuade China to give access to its cost-competitive software service firms that have dominated global markets. Some of these firms are pitching for ‘smart’ manufacturing projects in the central city of Wuhan and two other provinces in the healthcare and automotive sector. But it is in the drugs sector that India is hoping to make the first dent, according to officials and a government document. China has agreed to train Indian pharmaceutical executives to help them gain a swifter entry into the Chinese market, a government document seen by Reuters on efforts to improve trade with China showed. The training is planned for next month. India’s Pharmexcil and the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Medicines and Health Products will shortly sign an agreement to ease clearance processes and help Indian companies find Chinese partners, according to the document. Dua and the Indian trade ministry official said China will soon open a desk at its embassy in New Delhi to facilitate Indian drug makers.

2018-12-03," (Corrects to delete incorrect information that rocket carried a University of Illinois satellite) By Joey Roulette (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from California on Monday carrying 64 small satellites into low orbit around the Earth, which the company called the largest-ever “rideshare” mission by a U.S.-based rocket. The mission, dubbed SSO-A, also marked the third voyage to space for the same Falcon 9 rocket - another milestone for SpaceX’s cost-cutting reusable rocket technology.  The Falcon 9 blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 10:34 a.m. local time (18:34 GMT) carrying satellites from 34 different companies, government agencies and universities. SpaceX said the mission was “one of the most complex and intricate endeavors” for Seattle-based startup Spaceflight, the ride-share company that arranged passage for each satellite maker. The mission comes days after India fired a rocket carrying 31 satellites into space. After the launch, the Falcon 9’s first-stage booster returned to earth as planned, landing on a ship off the coast of southern California, according to a live video of the flight. However, the Falcon 9’s payload fairing - an enclosure that protected the satellites during launch - missed a landing net on  the barge and ended up in the ocean. “Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water,” Musk, SpaceX’s chief executive officer,  said on Twitter. He said the boat was moving to pick them up. “Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim,” Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla Inc, said on Twitter.

2018-12-05,"SEOUL (Reuters) - In downtown Seoul, some 40 young South Koreans last month braved early winter chills to show their support for a planned visit to the South Korean capital by North Korea’s leader, chanting “Kim Jong Un! Kim Jong Un! Kim Jong Un is a great man!”  Kim Soo-geun, who founded a youth group called “Welcome Committee for a Great Man”, has been drumming up donations from passers-by so they can run a subway advertisement to welcome Kim, who this year agreed to visit Seoul. “I like the communist party. You’ll like them soon as well,” he shouted. More than a dozen civic groups have sprung up to welcome Kim, visiting schools to collect welcome messages, imitating the dance moves of a North Korean art troupe and even naming their group after Mount Paektu, which Pyongyang says is the birthplace of Kim’s sacred bloodline.     Such activities have become possible as President Moon Jae-in’s administration relaxes enforcement of South Korea’s National Security Act amid efforts to improve relations with North Korea and halt its nuclear weapon and missile programmes. Thousands of students, citizens and defectors were prosecuted, jailed and even executed under the 1948 law, which bars “praising, inciting or propagating the activities of an anti-government organisation”. Most were accused of spying for Pyongyang or undertaking other pro-North activities. Now, the rise of far-left, pro-Pyongyang activists exploiting the looser enforcement of the law has sparked a backlash from conservative groups and ordinary citizens that experts say could erode public support for Moon and his peace drive. Economic and jobs woes have already pushed Moon’s approval ratings to the lowest levels since his 2017 election. Security officials and some defectors also say any abolition of the law could allow an influx of the North’s propaganda glorifying the Kim regime. “Most South Koreans would support peace-building efforts with the North, but they’re not ready to praise Kim who has yet to show his credentials as a trustworthy leader,” said Cho Han-bum, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. “To them, Kim is still a dictator.” Between January and October this year, only 15 people were charged with violating the law, the lowest level in 10 years, according to a Reuters review of Justice Ministry data submitted to Joo Kwang-deok, a lawmaker. Five years ago, 129 people were charged. “The act is virtually not being enforced,” Kim Jong-kwi, a lawyer who worked on six relevant legal cases. “Some say it’s now almost a dead letter.” The law was enacted by the South in the wake of a revolt by some 2,000 troops following Korea’s liberation from Japanese occupation in 1945.  Amid decades of sometimes violent confrontations with the North, the law became primarily aimed at suspected North Korean spies and sympathisers. Critics say opaque definitions like ‘praise’ and ‘incitement’ in the law allowed for arbitrary interpretations that led to abuses by past military dictatorships and governments to silence dissenters and political enemies. Between 2007 and 2016, the South Korean government paid more than 212 billion won ($190 million) in compensation to 1,311 South Koreans who were falsely charged for violating the law in cases dating back to the 1960s, according to Kim Dang, who compiled the data from the Justice Ministry and the National Intelligence Service. Now the political pendulum has swung to the left, the same opacity is allowing the law to fade in practice, experts say.  Moon, who as a presidential candidate said the law should be amended to prevent abuse by authorities, has cut staff at agencies tasked with enforcing it. The National Police Agency said its security investigation bureau has been cut to 479 this year from 580 last year. The administration has also reduced a military intelligence agency’s workforce by more than 30 percent to 2,900.  In an October survey of 1,013 South Koreans, more than half of them said they supported the National Security Act, while about a third said it should be scrapped or replaced, according a poll by R & Search. Pyongyang’s state media on Tuesday urged repeal of the “unprecedented fascist, anti-reunification” legislation.  “There is no reason for (the law) to exist now that a new phase of reconciliation and unity has arrived at the north-south relations,” KCNA said in a commentary. The division in South Korea is coming to a head as Moon pushes to host Kim to Seoul as soon as this month. On Monday, a coalition of eight defector, human rights and lawyers’ organisations said they were opposed to any more inter-Korean summits that fail to address human rights in the North.  U.N. investigators have reported the use of political prisons, starvation and executions in North Korea, saying security chiefs and possibly even Kim Jong Un should be held accountable. “The National Security Act is an anachronism from the Cold War era that really now should be repealed,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “But human rights must be on the agenda for all the various dialogues and discussions between North Korea and the outside world.” After the 40 young students staged their pro-Kim campaign, a conservative civic group filed a complaint to the prosecution against them for breaching the National Security Act. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office told Reuters that police are investigating the complaint. “Peace is all well and good but those organisations extolling Kim Jong Un are going way too far,” said Kim Jong-hoon, a 27-year-old IT worker. “I don’t think that’s the way to lasting peace.”  When asked about a potential souring of public sentiment over Kim’s visit, Moon said there can’t be a “split in public opinion” and he believes all South Koreans would welcome Kim “with open arms”. “Isn’t it every citizen’s wish if it helps realise denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and achieve peace between the South and the North?” Moon said.

2018-04-27,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Below is the full joint statement by North and South Korea released by the South Korean presidential office on Friday after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged to work for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula”. It punctuated a day of smiles and handshakes at the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade. During this momentous period of historical transformation on the Korean Peninsula, reflecting the enduring aspiration of the Korean people for peace, prosperity and unification, President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea held an Inter-Korean Summit Meeting at the ‘Peace House’ at Panmunjom on April 27, 2018. The two leaders solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun. The two leaders, sharing the firm commitment to bring a swift a swift end to the Cold War relic of longstanding division and confrontation, to boldly approach a new era of national reconciliation, peace and prosperity, and to improve and cultivate inter-Korean relations in a more active manner, declared at this historic site of Panmunjom as follows: 1. South and North Korea will reconnect the blood relations of the people and bring forward the future of co-prosperity and unification led by Koreans by facilitating comprehensive and groundbreaking advancement in inter-Korean relations. Improving and cultivating inter-Korean relations is the prevalent desire of the whole nation and the urgent calling of the times that cannot be held back any further. 1) South and North Korea affirmed the principle of determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord and agreed to bring forth the watershed moment for the improvement of inter-Korean relations by fully implementing all existing agreements and declarations adopted between the two sides thus far. 2) South and North Korea agreed to hold dialogue and negotiations in various fields including at high level, and to take active measures for the implementation of the agreements reached at the Summit. 3) South and North Korea agreed to establish a joint liaison office with resident representatives of both sides in the Gaeseong region in order to facilitate close consultation between the authorities as well as smooth exchanges and cooperation between the peoples. 4) South and North Korea agreed to encourage more active cooperation, exchanges, visits and contacts at all levels in order to rejuvenate the sense of national reconciliation and unity. Between South and North, the two sides will encourage the atmosphere of amity and cooperation by actively staging various joint events on the dates that hold special meaning for both South and North Korea, such as June 15, in which participants from all levels, including central and local governments, parliaments, political parties, and civil organizations, will be involved. On the international front, the two sides agreed to demonstrate their collective wisdom, talents, and solidarity by jointly participating in international sports events such as the 2018 Asian Games. 5) South and North Korea agreed to endeavor to swiftly resolve the humanitarian issues that resulted from the division of the nation, and to convene the Inter-Korean Red Cross Meeting to discuss and solve various issues including the reunion of separated families. In this vein, South and North Korea agreed to proceed with reunion programs for the separated families on the occasion of the National Liberation Day of August 15 this year. 6) South and North Korea agreed to actively implement the projects previously agreed in the 2007 October 4 Declaration, in order to promote balanced economic growth and co-prosperity of the nation. As a first step, the two sides agreed to adopt practical steps towards the connection and modernization of the railways and roads on the eastern transportation corridor as well as between Seoul and Sinuiju for their utilization. 2. South and North Korea will make joint efforts to alleviate the acute military tension and practically eliminate the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula. 1) South and North Korea agreed to completely cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain, including land, air and sea, that are the source of military tension and conflict. In this vein, the two sides agreed to transform the demilitarized zone into a peace zone in a genuine sense by ceasing as of May 2 this year all hostile acts and eliminating their means, including broadcasting through loudspeakers and distribution of leaflets, in the areas along the Military Demarcation Line. 2) South and North Korea agreed to devise a practical scheme to turn the areas around the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea into a maritime peace zone in order to prevent accidental military clashes and guarantee safe fishing activities. 3) South and North Korea agreed to take various military measures to ensure active mutual cooperation, exchanges, visits and contacts. The two sides agreed to hold frequent meetings between military authorities, including the defense Ministers Meeting, in order to immediately discuss and solve military issues that arise between them. In this regard, the two sides agreed to first convene military talks at the rank of general in May. 3. South and North Korea will actively cooperate to establish a permanent and solid peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. Bringing an end to the current unnatural state of armistice and establishing a robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula is a historical mission that must not be delayed any further. 1) South and North Korea reaffirmed the Non-Aggression Agreement that precludes the use of force in any form against each other, and agreed to strictly adhere to this Agreement. 2) South and North Korea agreed to carry out disarmament in a phased manner, as military tension is alleviated and substantial progress is made in military confidence-building. 3) During this year that marks the 65th anniversary of the Armistice, South and North Korea agreed to actively pursue trilateral meetings involving the two Koreas and the United States, or quadrilateral meetings involving the two Koreas, the United States and China with a view to declaring an end to the war and establishing a permanent and solid peace regime. 4) South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. South and North Korea shared the view that the measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and agreed to carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard. South and North Korea agreed to actively seek the support and cooperation of the international community for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The two leaders agreed, through regular meetings and direct telephone conversations, to hold frequent and candid discussions on issues vital to the nation, to strengthen mutual trust and to jointly endeavor to strengthen the positive momentum towards continuous advancement of inter-Korean relations as well as peace, prosperity and unification of the Korean Peninsula. In this context, President Moon Jae-in agreed to visit Pyongyang this fall.

2018-11-23,"AYODHYA, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities will launch a major security operation at the ruins of a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya on Sunday when tens of thousands of Hindu monks and religious leaders gather to urge the government to build a new Hindu temple on the disputed site. A militant Hindu mob demolished the centuries-old mosque in 1992, triggering communal riots that killed about 2,000 people across India. As millions of Hindus believe that the mosque stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities, the dispute continues to be at the core of tensions between Hindus and India’s Muslim minority.  Hindu groups insist that there was a temple at the site before the mosque was built in 1528.  “More than 200,000 people will attend,” said Surendra Jain, All India Joint General Secretary of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, a Hindu nationalist organisation, which is holding a ‘dharma sabha’ or religious congregation in Ayodhya. “We assure everyone, though we don’t need to, that not even a twig will be disturbed.” Ahead of a general election that must be held by May next year, leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its associates have become more vocal in their demand the government introduce legislation paving the way for a new Hindu temple on the site.  Authorities hope Sunday’s religious gathering does not further inflame tensions between Hindus and Muslims. “The government will ensure that the event passes off peacefully and the local administration has put in place an elaborate security apparatus,” Anil Pathak, district chief of Faizabad, where the Ayodhya town is located, told Reuters. “No one will be allowed to disturb peace and order in the city.” “We want to assure that the administration is geared up to maintain peace and protect people and properties in Ayodhya and Faizabad,” Pathak said.  Ayodhya is in the politically important northern Uttar Pradesh state, which is bigger than Brazil by population, and sends more lawmakers than any other state to India’s parliament.  Uttar Pradesh is ruled by BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu hardliner who has been accused of inciting violence against the country’s Muslim minority, who make up 14 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people. More than 900 extra police and a large number of military, including elite commandos, will be deployed at Sunday’s event, said Vivek Tripathi, spokesman for the Uttar Pradesh police. Tripathi said drone cameras would also monitor the event. Zafaryab Jilani, a senior member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said Muslims do not want a confrontation but the state administration must ensure the safety of the community. “Although the administration is vigilant, the planned meeting does bring back memories of 1992 when violence broke out after the demolition of the mosque,” said Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 65-year-old Muslim community leader.

2018-09-16,"(Reuters Health) - In healthy elderly people who never had a heart attack, the widespread practice of taking a baby aspirin every day may do more harm than good, according to a U.S.-Australian study of more than 19,000 volunteers. The trial has “provided convincing evidence that aspirin is ineffective in preserving good health in elderly people without a medical (reason) to be using it,” chief author Dr. John J. McNeil of Monash University in Melbourne told Reuters Health in an email. The results - which show that risks of major bleeding in low-dose aspirin users overwhelm any heart benefits - were reported online in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented Sunday at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Paris. The findings may upend a common practice. For people trying to prevent a second heart attack or stroke, evidence in support of baby aspirin therapy remains strong. But the new study, known as ASPREE, looked at the long-standing question of whether a first heart attack, stroke, or case of heart failure could be prevented with small amounts of the blood thinner in aspirin. Until now, the balance between risks and benefits in older individuals was unclear, said Dr. McNeil. Most volunteers had to be at least 70 years old. Patients who were black or Hispanic and living in the U.S. - two groups that face a higher risk of heart disease or dementia - could be age 65 or older. At the start of the study, all were expected to survive for at least five years. After about five years of treatment, the rate of heart disease was not significantly lower in the 9,525 volunteers taking 100 mg of aspirin daily than in the 9,589 who took placebo tablets. But the odds of a major bleeding episode were 38 percent higher with aspirin. Problems like stroke and intestinal bleeding occurred in 8.6 percent of aspirin patients versus 6.2 percent of placebo patients. “This should set the record straight,” said Dr. Vincent Bufalino of the Advocate Heart Institute in Chicago, who was not involved in the study. “There’s a lot of folks on both sides of this but this study should end the question. There is no benefit for seniors who do not have vascular disease.” “I’ve spent the last five, six years trying to get all my seniors to stop taking aspirin” based on the clear risks and unproven benefit, he told Reuters Health by phone. “If you look at the new findings, at best it’s neutral and at worst it increases the bleeding risk.” And what about people with high blood pressure or high cholesterol who might be taking other medicines to mitigate a higher risk of heart attack or stroke? In the new study, most volunteers fell into that category and aspirin didn’t seem to help them. “Essentially, we could not identify any subgroup in whom aspirin was beneficial in preserving good health,” Dr. McNeil said. The ASPREE study was stopped early as it became clear that the “wonder drug” wasn’t working wonders. While there were 21.5 cases of death, dementia or disability per 1,000 patients each year in the aspirin group, the rate was 21.2 with placebo. The difference wasn’t statistically significant, meaning it could have been due to chance.  But the rate of major bleeding with daily aspirin use was 3.8 percent, versus 2.8 percent with placebo. When the McNeil team looked at death from any cause, aspirin still made no difference statistically, with a rate of 12.7 per 1,000 patients each year with aspirin and 11.1 with placebo.  Extra cases of cancer were the chief reason for the higher death rate, with 3.1 percent of aspirin users dying of cancer versus 2.3 percent in the control group.  The higher pace of cancer deaths became apparent three and a half years after the study began, particularly death from stomach and intestinal tumors. The cancer finding surprised researchers because in other studies, aspirin protected against death from cancer. Thus, McNeil team said, the cancer results “should be interpreted with caution.” The study was coordinated at 34 sites in the U.S. and 16 in Australia.

2018-12-22,"THOOTHUKUDI, India (Reuters) - Twelve of the 13 protesters killed when police opened fire on a demonstration against Vedanta’s copper smelter in Tamil Nadu in May were hit by bullets in the head or chest, and half of those were shot from behind, autopsy reports show. Two others died after bullets pierced the sides of their heads, according to the reports produced by forensic medicine experts from several government hospitals and reviewed by Reuters. They have not been previously published. In the case of the youngest to be killed, a bullet entered the back of 17-year-old J. Snowlin’s head and exited through her mouth, the autopsy found.     “The deceased would appear to have died of cardio-pulmonary arrest due to firearm bullet injury to the back of the neck,” forensic medicine experts who examined Snowlin’s body wrote. When Reuters visited her family, they said they had not collected the teenager’s autopsy report. “We are continuing to exist, that’s it,” said her mother. Indian police rules allow the use of live ammunition to quell civil unrest, but stipulate the response should be proportionate and officers should not shoot to kill. Police Standing Orders for Tamil Nadu, the state where the shootings took place, say that, when using firearms, “aim should be kept low, preferably well below the waist level, and directed against the most threatening part of the mob”. The incident was the deadliest at an environmental protest in India in a decade. A working group of United Nations’ human rights experts in May condemned the “apparent excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by police”. Federal police are investigating the shootings, which took place as protesters were marching to the local government headquarters in the port city of Thoothukudi, demanding that a copper smelter controlled by London-headquartered Vedanta Resources be shut for allegedly polluting the environment.  No police officers have been arrested or charged in connection with the killings. In a statement following the incident the Tamil Nadu state government, which is responsible for the police, said: “Due to unavoidable circumstances, we had to take action to bring the situation under control.”  The Thoothukudi district administration and state police officials did not respond to emails seeking comments on the autopsy reports. Federal police investigating the deaths did not respond to requests for comment on the autopsy findings.  Vedanta did not respond to a request for comment. The company, which had no involvement in the shootings, has previously expressed regret over the deaths at the protest, which it call “absolutely unfortunate”. Four senior police and two government officials who were present on the day told Reuters in June they were forced to fire live ammunition as the crowd turned violent and threatened a neighbouring Vedanta employees’ apartment building. Among the eight people killed from bullets entering their head or body from behind or the side, 40-year-old Jansi, who like many people in Tamil Nadu goes by just one name, was shot a few hundred metres away from her house in a narrow street close to Thoothukudi’s seafront. She was shot through the ear, the report into her death showed.    A bullet went through the forehead of 34-year-old Mani Rajan. “The deceased would appear to have died of penetrating injury to the brain due to the firearm bullet injury to the right side of forehead,” Mani’s autopsy report said. The dead also included a man in his 50s, six men in their 40s, and three men in their early 20s. The head of the forensic science department at the Thoothukudi Medical College, where the autopsies were conducted, declined to comment, as did two of the principal examiners.  Reuters contacted 11 of the 13 families or friends of those killed, 10 of whom said they were not pursuing any legal action. One of the 11 said he was in touch with a lawyer and wanted justice, but did not elaborate further. Two of the families could not be reached for comment. Authorities in Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of the Vedanta smelter on environmental grounds immediately after the shootings at the May 22 protest. That order was overturned by a ruling from India’s green court on Dec. 15. Vedanta, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, has always denied damaging the environment. On Friday, the state high court asked the firm not to reopen the plant for another month, until it had heard an appeal from activists challenging the green court decision.  The shootings are being investigated by a court-mandated commission as well as the federal police. Officials familiar with the investigations said they were not likely to conclude “any time soon”. Fifteen police weapons were discharged in total, including three self-loading rifles (SLR), according to a state government documents submitted to the investigation commission and reviewed by Reuters. Of 69 live bullets used, 30 were fired from the three SLRs, according to the documents. Police fired an additional four rounds from .303 rifles and 12 shots from .410 weapons. The Police Standing Orders, an exhaustive manual on police action, recommends the use of .303 and .410 rifles as a last resort against violent crowds. Unlike the colonial-era .303 and .410, the SLR is modern rifle capable of continuous fire, said Jacob Punnose, former police chief of the neighbouring Kerala state. “There is no illegality per se,” he said, referring to the use of SLRs in such circumstances. “But it definitely goes against principle of minimum force.” Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Alex Richardson",https://in.reuters.com/article/vedanta-smelter/exclusive-anti-vedanta-protesters-killed-by-shots-to-head-chest-half-from-behind-autopsies-idINKCN1OL069
2018-08-16,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold recovered some ground on Friday as a weakening U.S. dollar relieved pressure on prices, but the precious metal remained near 19-month lows and looked poised for its biggest weekly drop since May 2017.  Spot gold XAU= added 0.31 percent to $1,177.21 ounce by 1:35 p.m. EDT (1735 GMT), but was down 2.7 percent this week in its sixth consecutive weekly loss. On Thursday, it touched $1,159.96, the lowest since January 2017.  U.S. gold futures GCcv1 for December delivery settled up 20 cents, or 0.02 percent, at $1,184.20 per ounce.  “The markets are very oversold and the dollar is overbought,” said John Caruso of RJO Futures. “It looks like some of the shorts are trying to book some profits.” From a 13-month high on Wednesday against a basket of six major currencies .DXY, the dollar has weakened against the currencies of key gold markets, the euro zone and China, helping gold regain its footing, said ABN AMRO analyst Georgette Boele.  “I expect the dollar to peak in the coming weeks ... Gold should bottom out here,” she said. Gold has tumbled 14 percent from its April high as a rally in the greenback made dollar-priced bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies. [FRX/] .DXY  Investors seeking a safe place to store assets amid trade disputes and a Turkish currency crisis have preferred the dollar to gold, undermining the reputation of bullion as a safe haven.

2018-12-07,"(Reuters) - Gold was sold at a discount this week in India for the first time in a month as a rebound in local prices prompted jewellers to postpone purchases, while demand improved in top consumer China due to seasonal buying. “Jewellers are delaying purchases expecting a correction in prices. The sudden price rise surprised them,” said Harshad Ajmera, the proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. Local gold prices have risen nearly 3 percent so far this week following gains in the overseas market and on a depreciation in the rupee. “Jewellers are struggling to understand the price trend due to volatility in the rupee. They are making small purchases,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion-importing bank. Dealers in India were offering a discount of up to $1.5 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, compared to a premium of $2 in the previous week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax. Retail jewellery demand was moderate as buyers were making purchases for weddings, Ajmera said. Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, the world’s second-biggest consumer after China, and it is a popular gift for special occasions. “Demand has been good in China and Hong Kong... Retail investors are buying gold because of the wedding and festive period,” said Brian Lan, managing director at Singapore dealer GoldSilver Central. Premiums of $5-$7.4 an ounce were charged in China against $6-$7 charged last week, while in Hong Kong premiums were quoted at $0.60-$1.50 against the previous week’s $0.90-$1.50 range. While higher prices softened demand in Singapore, traders said. Premiums in Singapore were slightly lower at $0.60-$0.70 compared to $0.70-$0.90 charged last week. Spot gold touched a near five-month peak at $1,244.32 an ounce on Thursday and was set to rise about 1.5 percent for the week.  In Japan, prices remained on par with the international benchmark for the 12th straight week. “Sentiment in gold is shrinking and if the price doesn’t change demand will decline,” a Tokyo-based trader said.

It is only a matter of time before this progress is reflected in the share price.” Sewing’s remarks followed the two-day raid as part of an investigation linked to the so-called Panama Papers leak of documents about offshore finance. Police searched the offices of all the bank’s board members, Sewing said. “But that is okay, I don’t have a problem with that. I want this matter to be cleared up as soon as possible,” he told the newspaper. Investigators are looking at the activities of unidentified Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients to set up offshore firms to launder money, the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office said. “It’s about two employees who, at the time, helped to work through everything surrounding the issue of the Panama Papers. In my view the presumption of innocence clearly applies until proven otherwise,” Sewing told the paper. “Since the publication of the Panama Papers in 2016 we have reviewed the whole issue and, in doing so, cooperated closely with the regulatory authorities. For us the case was concluded.” Asked whether he had made any mistakes, Sewing said: “I am at peace with myself and I am doing my job as well as I can.  “Of course, I would never say that I’m not making mistakes.

2018-12-20,"(Reuters) - The Indian government has sought parliament’s approval for an equity infusion of 23 billion rupees ($328.42 million) in state-owned carrier Air India, according to a government document released on Thursday. The government is also keen to pump in 8 billion rupees for Air India Asset Holding, a special purpose vehicle set up to privatise the ground handling transport business of the state carrier, stated the document that was tabled in parliament. A top civil aviation bureaucrat said in September that a $120 million capital injection for Air India was on the way, and the government was working on a relief package for the airline industry. In the current financial year ending March 2019, the government will be spending nearly 107 billion rupees to keep the national carrier operational.         Air India had sought 21.21 billion rupees of additional equity from the government for the fiscal year 2018-19 to make pending payments to its vendors, a source at the airline had told Reuters in July. The government had sought parliament approval in July to inject 9.8 billion rupees ($142.87 million) in the ailing carrier, after efforts to find a buyer for its 76 percent stake fizzled. India shelved the plan to sell a majority stake in the beleaguered airline due to lack of interest from bidders. The sale was key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to help keep the fiscal deficit at 3.3 percent of GDP, a goal which is already under pressure from giveaways to farmers and other welfare benefits ahead of the 2019 general elections. The airline, which had debt worth 487.81 million rupees as of March 31, 2017, has been kept afloat for years using taxpayer funds. The government’s efforts to revive the airline has been a setback to the prime minister’s efforts to cement his credentials as a reformist.  Jet Airways, India’s largest full-service carrier, and Air India are struggling to stem losses in the world’s fastest-growing domestic aviation market, where competition is intense and fuel taxes are high. India’s airline industry is forecast to lose up to $1.9 billion this financial year due to rising costs and low fares, according to consulting firm CAPA.

2018-06-16,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy on Saturday demanded that the Netherlands recall two Dutch-flagged migrant rescue ships after one of the non-governmental organisations that operate them called Rome’s interior minister a fascist. A heated exchange erupted after interior minister Matteo Salvini told more foreign NGOs operating migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean they could not dock in Italian ports. Salvini, who is also leader of the right-wing League and deputy prime minister, posted remarks on Facebook and Twitter in an escalating row with NGOs as one ship, the Aquarius, headed to Spain after being banned from Italian ports. Salvini has vowed to continue to block foreign humanitarian boats from Italian ports as Europe wrestles with how to share the responsibility of handling migrants trying to enter the EU from war zones and poor countries, largely across Africa and the Middle East. Salvini, who has emerged as the most outspoken member of Italy’s two-week-old government, said on Facebook that two other foreign NGO ships, the Lifeline and the Seefuchs, were off the coast of Libya waiting to pick up migrants abandoned by human traffickers. “They should know that Italy no longer wants to be an accomplice in the business of illegal immigration and therefore they will have to aim for other, non-Italian, ports,” Salvini said. Both ships fly Dutch flags. Italy says humanitarian NGOs are being exploited by human traffickers, a charge the NGOs deny. Rome says only migrants rescued by Italian ships can be brought to Italian ports. Following Salvini’s Facebook post, one of the NGOs, Mission Lifeline, tweeted in German “When fascists promote us ...” An irritated Salvini tweeted back, saying “insults and threats will not stop us” and that Italians would run their own country. Hours later, Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said on Twitter that “Holland should make them come home”, saying the rescue missions were in violation of codes of conduct because they did not have adequate means or personnel and could endanger lives. Mission Lifeline tweeted that they are “in full respect” of conduct codes. The Dutch mission in Brussels said the ships were not on the Netherlands’ official register. “But it does once again make poignantly clear this is an EU problem asking for an EU solution,” the Dutch mission said. The Lifeline, when contacted by Reuters, said it was sailing under a Dutch flag and that it was not on the official Dutch register because it was a smaller ship. The website marinetraffic.com listed both ships as being Dutch and both now off the coast of Libya. The exchange of barbs took place a day after Italy and France tried to bury the hatchet following a diplomatic squabble over Rome’s refusal to accept the Aquarius. The ship was off the coast of the Spanish island of Majorca on Saturday morning and was expected to arrive in Valencia on Sunday. It originally carried 629 migrants but some were later moved onto two Italian vessels escorting it to Spain.

2018-06-22,"MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Gold demand picked up in most Asian centres this week as prices of the yellow metal slid to a six-month low, with gold being sold at a premium in India for the first time in seven weeks. Spot gold touched its lowest since Dec. 19 at $1,260.84 an ounce on Thursday, weighed down by outlook for higher interest rates in the United States and as the dollar climbed to an 11-month peak.  “Demand has improved slightly due to the correction, but still many buyers are waiting for prices to fall further,” said Ashok Jain, proprietor of Mumbai-based wholesaler Chenaji Narsinghji. In the Indian market, gold futures were trading at around 30,562 rupees per 10 grams, down nearly 3 percent from last week’s peak of 31,424 rupees. Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $1 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, for the first time since the week of May 4. Last week, they were offering a discount of up to $7.5, the biggest since Sept. 9. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax. “Many jewellers are postponing purchases expecting prices could fall below $1,250 (an ounce),” said a Mumbai-based dealer at a private bullion importing bank.  In Singapore, premiums charged this week rose slightly to a range of 80 cents to $1 over benchmark spot, from the 60 cents to $1 range last week. “We see quite good demand (in Singapore). Individuals and businesses are picking up gold because now it is cheaper than before,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore. In Japan, gold was being sold at a premium of about 25 cents this week after being sold at par with the global benchmark for several weeks. In top consumer China, however, premiums were unchanged from the previous week at $5-$6 an ounce as demand remained quiet amid a weaker yuan, said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

2018-08-18,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. technology giants plan to intensify lobbying efforts against stringent Indian data localisation requirements, which they say will undermine their growth ambitions in India, sources told Reuters. U.S trade groups, representing companies such as Amazon, American Express and Microsoft, have opposed India’s push to store data locally. That push comes amid rising global efforts to protect user data but is one that could hit planned investments by the firms in the Indian market, where the companies currently have limited data storage. The issue could further undermine already strained economic relations between India and the United States. Technology executives and trade groups have discussed approaching Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office to appraise him of their worries. Separately, the industry is considering pitching the issue as a trade concern, including at the India-U.S. talks in September in New Delhi, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Though a final decision hasn’t been made, the deliberations come while the United States and India are locked in a dispute over U.S. tariff increases and on the Indian policy of capping prices of medical devices, which hurts American pharmaceutical companies. “This issue is important enough to be discussed at the India-U.S. trade level,” said Amba Kak, a global public policy adviser at the Internet company Mozilla Corp. “Data localisation is not just a business concern, it potentially makes government surveillance easier, which is a worry.” Stricter localisation norms would help India get easier access to data when conducting investigations, but critics say it could lead to increased government demands for data access. Technology firms worry the mandate would hurt their planned investments by raising costs related to setting up new local data centres. Greater use of digital platforms in India for shopping or social networking have made it a lucrative market for technology companies, but a rising number of data breaches have pushed New Delhi to develop strong data protection rules. Shamika Ravi, a member of Modi’s economic advisory council, said data localisation was a global phenomena and India wasn’t an outlier.  “It’s in the long term strategic and economic interest,” said Ravi, who is also a research director at Brookings India. The main government committee on data privacy last month proposed a draft law, recommending restrictions on data flows and proposing that all “critical personal data” should be processed only within the country. It would be left to the government to define what qualifies as such data. Global companies are coming together to push back. In a meeting last week organised by lobby group U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, executives from Facebook, Mastercard, Visa, American Express, PayPal, Amazon, Microsoft and others discussed plans to approach Indian lawmakers, including Indian parliamentary panels on information technology (IT) and finance, five sources said. The industry also discussed approaching media and internet groups to explain why data localisation would be bad for India’s booming IT, e-commerce and payments landscape, the sources said. “People are fairly stressed and scared,” said an executive working for a multinational technology firm.  The U.S.-India lobby group said it was “nearly impossible” to implement “industry-specific regulations in our global data environment without the ripples being felt”. It didn’t comment on its recent meeting, but said it will continue facilitating policy discussions. Mastercard, American Express and Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment, while Facebook, Microsoft, Visa and PayPal declined to comment. The Indian bill, which was opened for public comments this week, will later go to parliament for approval.  The U.S.-India Business Council, a lobby group that is part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has brought in the Washington-headquartered law firm Covington & Burling to suggest submissions on India’s data protection law. The firm’s 43-page draft recommendations, seen by Reuters, listed removing data localisation requirements as a top priority and called New Delhi’s proposed move a “protectionist approach”.  The U.S.-India Business Council didn’t comment on how it would act on the recommendations of Covington & Burling, which declined comment. The lobby group’s president, Nisha Biswal, however said India’s draft privacy law was of “great importance,” and that the group would share its concerns with the government directly.

2018-11-18,"BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China on Monday launched a probe into whether Australian barley suppliers dumped cheap imports into their biggest market over the past year, catching the grain trade on the hop just as drought shrivels Australian crops and drives prices higher. Coming amid strained diplomatic ties between Beijing and Canberra, the move by Beijing’s commerce ministry comes after the China Chamber of International Commerce complained that Australian barley was sold at lower-than-normal prices for the 12 months through September 2018, hurting domestic suppliers.  Australia is by far China’s top supplier of barley, used both in brewing and livestock feed. It exported 6.48 million tonnes in 2017, close to three-quarters of China’s roughly 8.86 million tonnes of imports of the grain, worth about $1.5 billion, according to Chinese customs. The timing of the move left grain analysts and traders scratching their heads for an explanation, with some among the latter suggesting it may be politically motivated: Australian barley has now become expensive as supplies have dwindled amid extreme drought. “It’s a bit odd to take this moment to ask the (Chinese) state to put safeguard measures in place,” said Even Rogers Pay, an agriculture analyst at China Policy, a Beijing-based consultancy. The probe follows a period of tense relations between Australia and China. Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull accused Beijing of interfering in its domestic affairs while in office, and the two countries have been jostling for influence in Pacific island countries that control swathes of resource-rich ocean. “Australia will mount the strongest possible case to uphold the integrity and market access of our world-leading agricultural producers against these unsubstantiated allegations,” said Australia’s Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham, in a statement issued later on Monday.  Birmingham said regulatory authorities were simply “doing their job” by investigating claims made by local business. He said the application for the probe had been lodged “many weeks ago” and that in the last two weeks the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Trade Minister have had “positive engagements” with Chinese counterparts. The probe starts on Monday and will end within one year, with an option for an additional six months of investigation. The Chinese commerce chamber’s request for an investigation said the volume of barley imports from Australia jumped 67 percent from 2014 to 2017 while prices slipped to $198.05 per tonne, nearly a third below their 2014 level. As part of its probe, the ministry will also look into whether domestic suppliers’ business was damaged in the period from Jan. 1, 2014 until Sept. 30, 2018.  China produced 1.66 million tonnes of barley in 2017, according to the commerce chamber, down from 1.81 million tonnes in 2014. “It’s a political stunt,” said one Melbourne-based grains trader who declined to be named because he wasn’t authorised to talk to media. “It is true that Australian production has grown in recent years, but this reflects the seasonal conditions and strong demand from China from its malting sector and livestock industry.” High prices have recently curbed demand from China’s animal feed makers: Australian barley currently costs about $275 per tonne including freight, about the same price as Chinese corn. But China’s brewing industry typically pays more for higher grades of the grain, and is likely to be significantly impacted as importers hold off booking new cargoes, said analysts. There are currently about 10 to 20 barley cargoes booked for China, said a trader based in southern China who imports Australian barley, declining to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media.  At China Policy, analyst Pay said, “It will put a huge amount of pressure on the industry, especially brewers, to forgo or pay higher prices for Australian barley.” “But this past year has made it pretty clear that there’s a willingness to take steps that will have short-term consequences [on domestic industry],” Pay said, referring to China’s decision to impose 25 percent duties on soybeans from the United States, its No.2 supplier.

2018-09-02,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping offered another $60 billion in financing for Africa on Monday and wrote off some debt for poorer African nations, while warning against funds going towards “vanity projects”. Speaking at the opening of a major summit with African leaders, Xi promised development that people on the continent could see and touch, but that would also be green and sustainable. China has denied engaging in “debt trap” diplomacy, and Xi’s offer of more money comes after a pledge of another $60 billion at the previous summit in South Africa three years ago. Xi, addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, said the new $60 billion will include $15 billion of aid, interest-free loans and concessional loans, a credit line of $20 billion, a $10 billion special fund for China-Africa development, and a $5 billion special fund for imports from Africa.  Chinese companies will be encouraged to invest no less than $10 billion in the continent in the next three years, he said. Government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries, as well as for developing nations in the continent’s interior and small island nations, Xi said.  “China-Africa cooperation must give Chinese and African people tangible benefits and successes that can be seen, that can be felt,” he said. China will carry out 50 projects on green development and environmental protection in Africa, focusing on fighting climate change, desertification and wildlife protection, Xi said. He pledged, without giving details, that China would set up a peace and security fund and a related forum, while continuing to provide free military assistance to the African Union. Chinese officials have vowed to be more cautious to ensure projects are sustainable. China defends continued lending to Africa on the grounds that the continent still needs debt-funded infrastructure development. Speaking earlier at a business forum, Xi said China had to be careful about where money was spent. “China’s cooperation with Africa is clearly targeted at the major bottlenecks to development. Resources for our cooperation are not to be spent on any vanity projects but in places where they count the most,” he said. Beijing has also fended off criticism it is only interested in resource extraction to feed its own booming economy, that the projects it funds have poor environmental safeguards, and that too many of the workers for them are flown in from China rather than using African labour. Chinese officials say this year’s summit will strengthen Africa’s role in Xi’s Belt and Road initiative to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa through an infrastructure network modelled on the old Silk Road.  Xi said the plan, for which Beijing has pledged $126 billion, would help provide more resources and facilities for Africa and would expand shared markets. China loaned around $125 billion to the continent from 2000 to 2016, data from the China-Africa Research Initiative at Washington’s Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies shows. State media has accused the West of sour grapes over China’s prominent role in Africa and has angrily rejected claims of forcing African countries into a debt trap. “In terms of cooperation with China, African countries know best,” widely read tabloid the Global Times wrote in an editorial on Monday.  “Western media deliberately portray Africans in misery for collaborating with China and they appear to have discovered big news by finding occasional complaints in the African media about Sino-Africa cooperation,” it said. Every African country is represented at the business forum apart from eSwatini, self-ruled Taiwan’s last African ally that has so far rejected China’s overtures to ditch Taipei and recognise Beijing. African presidents in attendance include South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Zambia’s Edgar Lungu and Gabon’s Ali Bongo. There are some controversial guests.  Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, who has been in power for nearly 30 years, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes over killings and persecution in Sudan’s Darfur province between 2003 and 2008. Xi told him on Sunday that “foreign forces” should not interfere in Sudan’s internal affairs, China’s Foreign Ministry said. China is not a party to the court. “China has always had reservations about the International Criminal Court’s indictment and arrest order against Sudan’s president. We hope the ICC can prudently handle the relevant issue,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.

2018-09-03,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is allowing state refiners to import Iranian oil with Tehran arranging tankers and insurance after firms including the country’s top shipper Shipping Corp of India (SCI) halted voyages to Iran due to U.S. sanctions, sources said. New Delhi’s attempt to keep Iranian oil flowing mirrors a step by China, where buyers are shifting nearly all their Iranian oil imports to vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC). The moves by the two top buyers of Iranian crude indicate that the Islamic Republic may not be fully cut off from global oil markets from November, when U.S. sanctions against Tehran’s petroleum sector are due to start. President Donald Trump ordered the reimposition of economic curbs after withdrawing the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. No one trading with Iran will do business with America, he said. “We have the same situation (as most Western shippers) because there is no cover, so we cannot go (to Iran),” an SCI official told Reuters. New Delhi turned to the NITC fleet after most insurers and reinsurers had begun winding down services for Iran, wanting to avoid falling foul of the sanctions given their large exposure to the United States. SCI had a contract until August to import Iranian oil for Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), two sources familiar with the matter said. Eurotankers, which had a deal with MRPL to import two Iranian oil cargoes every month, has also said it cannot undertake Iranian voyages from September, the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to talk to the media about commercial deals. “The shipping ministry has given refiners permission to buy Iranian oil on a CIF (cost, insurance and freight) basis,” a government source said. Under a CIF arrangement, Iran would provide shipping and insurance, enabling Indian refiners to continue purchases of the country’s oil despite the non-availability of cover from Western insurers due to the restrictions imposed by Washington. The move would benefit Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and MRPL, which plan to lift Iranian cargoes during the rest of the fiscal year ending on March 31. India wants to continue buying oil from OPEC member Iran as Tehran is offering almost free shipping and an extended credit period. State refiners, which drove India’s July imports of Iranian oil to a record 768,000 barrels per day, had planned to nearly double oil imports from Iran in 2018/19.  Unlike their private peers, India’s state-run refiners need government permission to import oil on a delivered, or CIF, basis. Federal policy requires them to favour Indian insurers and shippers by buying only on a free on board (FOB) basis. The permission for CIF purchases applies only to existing annual contracts with Iran, the government source said. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, will finalise its strategy on crude purchases from Tehran after a meeting with top U.S. officials this week, a senior government official told Reuters last week. SCI, Eurotankers, the shipping ministry, MRPL, IOC and BPCL did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment.

2018-12-17,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will give financial assistance of $1.4 billion to the Maldives, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, the biggest aid yet to the Indian Ocean island nation that is grappling with debt from a Chinese building spree. Modi made the announcement after talks with Maldives’ new president, Mohamed Ibrahim Solih, who defeated the pro-China strongman Abdulla Yameen in a surprise election result in October and is trying to reset ties with India. During a five-year construction boom in the Maldives, China built a sea bridge connecting the capital, Male, to the main airport and is developing the airport itself, as well as building housing on land reclaimed from the sea.  But the fast-paced building activity has stoked fears that the Maldives has loaded up on debt that could be anything from $1.5 billion to more than $3 billion.  Solih’s administration has said it is trying to find out just how much the country of 400,000 people owes China. Modi said India stood ready to help the Maldives as a close friend and neighbour.  “For Maldives’ social and economic development we are providing a financial assistance of $1.4 billion in the form of budgetary support, currency swap agreements and concessional lines of credit,” he said during a brief media appearance with Solih. Both India and China have been trying to build regional influence in the Maldives and other Indian Ocean countries such as Sri Lanka that lie along vital shipping lanes. Soon after he took over last month, Solih said state coffers had been looted over the past few years and warned that the country was in financial difficulty after racking up debt with Chinese lenders. Solih said the Maldives and India had signed agreements to cooperate on trade, health and defence. India would help improve Maldives’ security through joint patrols as well as aerial surveillance, officials said. India’s big worry has been that China’s expansive diplomacy in the region was aimed at securing an outpost on an island in the Maldives. Modi said he had discussed regional security with Solih and both had agreed not to allow each other’s territory to be used against the other.  Reporting by Krishna N.
