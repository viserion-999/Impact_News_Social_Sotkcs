2018-07-04,"The Mukesh Ambani-controlled oil-to-retail-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries (RIL) will hold its 41st annual general meeting (AGM) on July 5, 2018.The AGM will begin at 11 am at Birla Matushri Sabhagar, 19, Sir Vithaldas Thackersey Marg, near Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre, in Mumbai.For the last few years, RIL has made massive Jio-related announcements during the AGM and the trend is expected to continue. Not to forget, the highly-anticipated JioPhone was launched at the same event last year, which was made available for a refundable deposit of Rs 1,500.Reports suggest that RIL could well announce the commercial launch and prices for its broadband venture, JioFiber service.So what is JioFiber and how is it different from other broadband connections?JioFiber is the latest offering from Jio for your home. It offers ultimate broadband experience to surf, stream, game and work, because of its ultra-fast upload and download speeds and effective functioning in merely ""milli seconds"".JioFiber connectivity comes directly to your home unlike in most cases where the fiber reaches only until the building and the last few meters of end connectivity is done using the traditional cable which drastically reduces the speed and user experience due to patches and inferior cable qualities of such patch up.The current offer as listed on the Jio website is the JioFiber preview offer which gives you ultra high-speed internet up to 100Mbps for 90 days along with a monthly data quota of 100 GB and a complimentary access to a host of Jio's premium apps.Highlights from March quarter results:Reliance Industries reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore for the March quarter, up 17 percent compared to the same quarter of the previous year.Consolidated quarterly revenues stood at Rs 1.29 lakh crore, up 39 percent quarter on quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 5 percent, QoQ, to Rs 18,469 crore, and the operating margin was 15.8 percent.Jio has continued its strong subscriber growth trend with net addition during the quarter of 26.5 mn and its total count reached to 186 million. Higher competition has capped ARPU to Rs 137 which resulted in lower revenue of Rs 8,421 crore.Most brokerages have highlighted that the results have largely been in line with estimates, but have raised target prices up to Rs 1,200.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-10-16,"Telecom-oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries is set to announce its second quarter (July-September) earnings on October 17. Analysts largely expect steady set of numbers for the quarter driven by petrochemical and Jio businesses.The company is expected to report strong growth in petrochemical, telecom and retail segments but it is likely to be offset by weak refining business.Sharekhan expects Reliance Industries (RIL) to benefit from a weak rupee and higher petrochemical volumes and margins.The stock rallied 29 percent during the quarter and gained 26 percent year-to-date. It has, though, corrected nearly 12 percent since August 28, when the market touched record high.Here are five key things to watch out for in earnings:RevenueConsolidated revenue during the quarter is likely to grow 8.5 percent sequentially to Rs 1,39,657.5 crore compared to Rs 1,28,756 crore in previous quarter, according to Reuters estimates.Petrochemical business is expected to do better led by healthy petchem deltas and strong volume growth. Analysts expect petrochemical segment's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) growth to be around 8 percent sequentially while refining earnings before interest and tax may be down around 0.5-1 percent QoQ due to fall in margins driven by FCC shutdown.While maintaining 'Buy' call on the stock, Motilal Oswal said core segment performance of the company is expected to be strong, going forward. ""Positive developments in the telecom business should drive growth for the company.""ProfitReuters poll indicated that consolidated profit for September quarter is expected to increase 0.8 percent to Rs 9,534.94 crore compared to reported income of Rs 9,459 crore in June quarter.""We expect a marginal increase in consolidated profits driven by a higher contribution from Jio, retail and US shale,"" Kotak said, but Motilal Oswal expects RIL to report consolidated PAT growth of 6 percent QoQ to Rs 10,050 crore.Gross Refining MarginMotilal Oswal and Equirus said the Mukesh Ambani Group company is expected to report gross refining margin for the quarter at around $10.2 a barrel against $10.5 a barrel in June quarter while Sharekhan expects the same at $10.6 a barrel.Brokerage houses feel flat benchmark GRM, sequential decline in light-heavy differential and decline in diesel/petrol crack may impact company's refining margin.Reuters Singapore Complex GRM was up 2 percent QoQ (up 26 percent YoY) to $6 a barrel in Q2FY19 versus $8.3 a barrel in Q2FY18 and $6.1 a barrel in Q1FY19.Crude oil price continued its upward trend in September quarter. Average Brent crude price was up 45 percent YoY and 1 percent QoQ at $75 a barrel.Reliance JioMost analysts expect the Q2 is expected to be another strong quarter for Reliance Jio, driven by consistent addition in subscriber basis, though average revenue per user (ARPU) may remain under pressure.Kotak estimated Jio's reported profits to increase to Rs 910 crore in Q2FY19 from Rs 610 crore reported in June quarter while Emkay expects Jio EBIT to increase 20 percent QoQ.RetailAnalysts expect strong growth rates to continue in retail business.Emkay Research sees EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth at 11 percent in Q2 on sequential basis.Nomura expects retail revenue to grow 5 percent and earnings before interest & tax to increase 10.2 percent QoQ. EBIT margin may expand 20 bps sequentially.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold? Here are some dos and don'tsCopyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

2018-04-27,"Reliance Industries (RIL) reported an operationally healthy Q4FY18 across most verticals, even if gross refining margins (GRM) were slightly below expectations. The strong overall performance was largely driven by traction in the petrochemicals, digital, and retail segments. While we expected a healthy performance from petrochemicals (petchem) and digital segments, what came as a surprise was the phenomenal topline and profit growth from retail. Jio continued to post a good set of numbers and posted a positive EBITDA and profit after tax in the quarter ended March.Overall revenue grew almost 30 percent year-on-year (YoY )along with a 51 percent YoY uptick in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and a 1700 basis points (bps) margin expansion. Net profit growth was a tad slow at 17 percent mostly due to higher interest and depreciation costs with most major projects coming on stream.Segment wise performance –Petrochemicals – volumes and price drive growthIn line with expectations, the petrochemical segment reported a robust performance, helping drive overall profitability. A strong 13-percent topline growth in the petrochemical business was driven by a mix of higher prices for products along with higher volumes especially in paraxylene and ROGC (refinery of gas cracker).  EBIT growth of 12 percent was driven by strong margins from polypropylene, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and downstream polyester products.Also Read: Top 10 takeaways from Reliance Industries' Q4 resultsWhile the fiscal had started on a slow note, Q2FY18 saw strong traction driven by high growth in the polymer and polyester demand which helped the company touch its highest-ever production levels. With all major projects now fully commissioned, the upcoming year is expected to witness strong growth with high volumes and management has guided to stability in margins.Though substantially outperforming the benchmark Singapore GRM of USD 7 per billion barrel (bbl), the GRM at USD 11 per bbl remained slightly below expectation. Higher crude prices facilitated the 30 percent increase in the top line, however, the adverse move in Brent-Dubai differentials and reduced crude throughput led to a decline in the segment EBIT. Volumes grew almost 42 percent in the 1,313 fuel outlets across the country.Oil demand grew on the back of global demand upswing led largely by the aviation, gasoline and diesel verticals. Domestic demand remained close to 1.6 million barrels (mbl) per day during FY18, much above the expected levels of 1.3 mbl. In FY19, demand is expected to stay steady around 1.5 mbl, which would facilitate growth in the segment and improve margins.Organized retail – a positive surpriseThe results from the organized retail segment came as a positive surprise with a phenomenal 134 percent topline growth during the quarter along with almost a 300 percent growth in EBIT led by expanding scale, and operational efficiencies. Volumes grew across consumer baskets and traction in this segment marks the overall expanding presence of the company’s consumer portfolio. RIL plans to further expand its consumer retail presence in every format which would further drive profitability in the coming years. Strong traction in this high-margin business will be worth watching out for.Upstream Oil segment – less erosion with high crude pricesUpstream performance remained near flattish with an overall decline in production. The crude oil price continued its upward trend in 4QFY18, up 24 percent YoY, which helped to make up for a portion of the loss. Ramping up of the CBM operation and the commencement of the upstream gas production would be some key developments in the future.Jio – keeping strongJio reported revenue from operations of Rs 7,128 crores (up 3.6 percent quarter on quarter) and added 26.5 million net subscribers over the last quarter, bringing the subscriber base to 186.6 million at the end of March 2017.The company continued to follow its strategy of capturing subscriber base aggressively even if it meant lower ARPU (average revenue per user). The strategy resulted in a strong sequential growth of 16.6 percent in its net subscriber base whereas its ARPU declined by 11 percent and stood at Rs 137.1 per month, still much better than what Bharti Airtel, the market leader, reported (Rs 116).In terms of operating margin, Jio reported a minor contraction of 40bps in its EBITDA margin, which came at 37.8 percent, respectable nevertheless. The contraction was primarily due to the reduction in tariff to maintain the price difference with the incumbents. This got partially offset by the reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15.7 percent of revenues from operations to 15.0 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reduced interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).What next?After the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL now stands at a sweet spot where most of its projects have started delivering. The company is likely to see a big cash flow boost in upcoming years along with enhanced operating efficiencies and an uptick in the return ratios. The overall macro environment also stands quite conducive to the various verticals where the company has exposure.With the full commissioning of the refinery off cracker plant, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already posting good growth.We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-03-23,"Reliance Industries has inked a deal to combine over-the-top (OTT) music platform Saavn with its own digital music service JioMusic in a transaction worth over USD 1 billion, the oil-to-telecom behemoth said in a statement on Friday.JioMusic’s implied valuation for the transaction was USD 670 million, RIL said. The company will invest an additional USD 100 million towards making the combined platform one of the largest music streaming services in the world.Of the USD 100 million, USD 20 million will be invested upfront, the company said, adding that the three co-founders of Saavn – Rishi Malhotra, Paramdeep Singh, and Vinodh Bhat – will continue in their respective leadership roles at the combined entity.The investments will be made in the form of rupee-equivalents of the amounts mentioned above.In addition to this deal, Reliance Industries will also acquire a part of the stake held by Saavn’s existing shareholders for a sum of USD 104 million.

2018-07-27,"Reliance Industries (RIL) reported healthy numbers for the June quarter, led by strong performance in the petchem, Jio and retail segments. Refining margins were soft, in line with global trends, but record volumes in the petrochemical segment more than compensated for it. Retail too saw yet another quarter of robust growth.Jio continued to post strong revenue growth, along with an improvement in operating profitability during the quarter.Segment wise performancePetrochemicals – record performancePetchem segment reported record earnings with a 58 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in realizations and a stellar 95 percent YoY uptick in profitability. Margins improved 370 basis points YoY. The strong performance was driven by 1) robust 35 percent increase in volumes 2) improved realization with uptick in crude 3) commissioning and stabilization of the refinery of gas cracker unit (ROGC) and its downstream units 4) improved polyester margins 5) stable polymer margins 6) rapid growth in domestic demand for petchem products 7) globally improving product pricesRefining – lower refining margin in line with global trendRefining contributes more than two third of the group’s revenues. Performance was slightly tepid during the quarter with gross refining margins (GRM) at $10.5 per  barrel (bbl) (Q1FY18: $11.9/bbl). However, the softness was in line with weak global GRMs, but a good $4.5/bbl above the Singapore benchmark margins. While revenue increased 43 percent YoY, earnings before interest and taxes (excluding exceptional items) declined 17 percent due to 1) weakness in gross refining margins 2) lower crude throughput 3) adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials 4) weak gasoline prices due to higher inventory across the globe and higher exports from China due to low internal growth.Retail downstream oil business reported strong growth during the quarter with 25 percent YoY increase in gasoline volumes. The company now plans to re-commission fuel outlets in order to drive further volume growth.Oil and Gas – earning erosion continuesThe upstream oil and gas segment saw improved realization with an 8 percent YoY growth in revenue due to rapid uptick in the oil and gas prices globally. However with declining volumes in both domestic (down 11.8 percent) and US shale (down 26.6 percent), the segment EBIT continued to be negative. Incremental production from the CBM block neutralized the dip in production from the KG D6 basin. The company now plans to start monetizing its KG D6 block and drilling work has started in July.Retail – expanding rapidlyRapid store expansion, coupled with improved customer engagement processes across all segment, helped the retail segments top-line grow 123 percent YoY during the quarter, despite a high base last year. Margins improved 160 basis points led by emphasis on cost control initiatives and benefits of operating leverage owing to additional stores.Fashion - Aggressive store expansion, loyalty programmes, tie-ups with leading foreign apparel brands, foray into the mothercare category, online sales (through AJIO), and higher contribution of private labels should help RR consolidate its strengths better.Grocery – The quarter saw robust growth across all sub-segments (home and personal care, staples, fruits, vegetables). We believe improved brand visibility with store additions will attract more footfalls and increase volumes.Reliance Digital – The company plans to undertake integration of its existing 305 physical digital stores with new ‘Jio Points’ and ‘Reliance ResQ’ (the service arm) centres which would help further widen the customer base in the upcoming quarters.Jio – continues capturing the marketJio’s operating revenues revenue rose 13.8 percent YoY to Rs 8,109 crore (up 13.8 percent quarter-on-quarter). The division added 28.7 million net subscribers over the last quarter, expanding the subscriber base to 215.3 million at the end of June 2017. Jio achieved a subscriber base of 200 million within 21 months of starting operations.Despite strong competition, Jio’s ARPU (average revenue per user) witnessed a marginal dip of 1.9 percent QoQ. (Airtel posted a decline of 9.5 percent).Jio’s EBITDA margins expanded 100 bps to 38.8 percent, a commendable achievement. This was helped by a reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15 percent of revenues from operations to 13 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).OutlookPost the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL is now in a sweet spot. Most of its projects are in the monetization phase, and this will boost cash flows in quarter ahead, in turn improving operating efficiencies. The overall macro environment is also quite conducive for the various verticals where the company has exposure.With full commissioning of the refinery off gas cracker plant, the petchem segment reported a strong growth which is expected to continue and further grow given the rapidly growing domestic demand. With higher vertical integrations, we expect margins in this segment to expand.The company is now focused on aggressively expanding the retail consumer business presence. We expect the stellar performance to continue and margins to improve further with increasing volumes.We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-11-21,"Reliance Jio Infocomm will serve the country's largest and most sought-after accounts in telecom - the railways - from January 1, with officials saying it is likely to slash the national transporter's phone bills by around 35 percent at least.Railways has been using Bharti Airtel for over six years as its telecom provider for 1.95 lakh mobile phone connections used by its employees in closed user group (CUG) across the country for which the railways paid around Rs 100 crore bill per year, they said.Its validity will expire on December 31 this year.A Railway Board order issued on November 20 said it ""had assigned the responsibility to RailTel (railway PSU) for finalisation of fresh CUG scheme for Indian Railways as the validity of the existing scheme is expiring on December 31, 2018. Fresh CUG scheme had since been finalised by RailTel and Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited has been awarded the contract to implement the scheme.""""The fresh CUG will come into effect from January 1, 2019,"" said the order which detailed the tariff rates to be provided by the company.Closed User group (CUG) is a supplementary service provided by the mobile operators to subscribers who can make and receive calls from any member associated within the group. This service is applicable for SMS also.Under the scheme, Reliance Jio, the latest entrant in the telecom market, will provide 4G/3G connections and calls will be free of charge.The company will provide four packages to railways - one for its senior most officials (two percent subscribers) - a 60 GB plan with a monthly rental of Rs 125, a 45 GB plan at a monthly rental of Rs 99 for its joint secretary level officers (26 per cent subscribers), a 30 GB plan at a rental of Rs 67 for Group C staff (72 per cent subscribers) and a Rs 49 rental plan for bulk SMS.For regular subscribers, a 25 GB plan of Jio is available for Rs 199 and subscribers have to pay Rs 20 per GB thereafter to top up their plans.Railway employees have to pay Rs 10 for 2 GB of extra data they use and more thereafter, according to the plan worked out by Jio.While under the present scheme railways is charged for calls outside CUG, the plan from January 1 will not do so. Also, the 3G/4G data pack in effect from next year is much cheaper than the present packs available to railways.""While Airtel is serving around 1.95 lakh railway subscribers, Jio will serve 3.78 lakh personnel of the railways, and because of the increase in the numbers, we are getting a better deal from the service provider. As a result of this, we are likely to reduce our phone bill by around 35 percent,"" a senior official said.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-07-07,"Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved giving Mukesh Ambani another five years as the Chairman and Managing Director of the company. Ambani, 61, has been on the board of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) since 1977 and was elevated as Chairman of the company after the death of his father and group patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani in July 2002.The company put a resolution to re-appoint Ambani ""for a period of five years, on expiry of his present term of office, i e with effect from April 19, 2019"" at the 41st Annual General Meeting held on July 5 in Mumbai.As many as 50,818 crore shares out of a total share base of 616.45 crore voted on the resolution, RIL said in a regulatory filing.

2018-01-22,"For Reliance Industries (RIL), the biggest surprise in the December quarter came in the form of the performance of its telecom venture Reliance Jio. The carrier not only reported a strong EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), but also posted an after-tax profit merely two quarters after its commercial launch.In terms of financial performance, Jio reported revenue from operations of Rs 6,879 crores in the quarter ended December, up 11.9 percent from the previous quarter. It added 21.5 million subscribers during the quarter, bringing its total subscriber base to 160.1 million as on December 31, 2017.This translates to an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 154 per month, which is 1.5 percent lower than in the previous quarter, but still much better than market leader Bharti Airtel, which reported an ARPU of Rs 123, down 15.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, for the quarter under review.In terms of other operating parameters as well, Jio fared much better than Airtel. The Reliance Industries-owned operator added a net of 21.5 million customers, while the market leader could only add 13.1 million customers. Total wireless traffic for Jio was 4,413 billion MB, significantly higher than Airtel's 1,106 billion MB.Jio's spectacular performance came on the back of a pan-India distribution network of over 1 million retailers, its widespread 4G reach and VoLTE technology, which provides fast speed data streaming and allows to make calls through data.This led to the highest per capita voice consumption at 694 minutes per month and 200 crore hours of high-speed video consumption per month.In terms of profitability, Jio reported an expansion of 1,472.5 bps in its EBITDA margin, which came in at 38.2 percent. The expansion was primarily due to the reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 34.8 percent of revenues from operations to 15.7 percent in the quarter gone by. This was because the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective October 1, 2017.What came as a boon for Jio was actually a bane for Airtel because the higher IUC being incurred by Jio was being paid to the market leader. As a result of TRAI's decision, Airtel’s operating profit margin came under pressure and contracted 173 bps QoQ to 33.8 percent, around 440 bps lower than Jio's.In addition to this, Jio’s management attributed the company's performance to use of efficient 4G technology and significant addition of paying customers during the quarter.In terms of capacity, the Reliance Industries-owned carrier continues to score much higher than its incumbents, with a capacity utilization in teens during the quarter gone by, which leaves a lot of room for the company to grow without additional capital expenditure.The management indicated that Jio is on track to achieve 99 percent of population coverage by end of the current year and is targeting an increase in ARPU to Rs 500 from premium customers. The company has also set its sights on capturing 50 percent market share of the Rs 3 trillion wireless market and a return on capital employed (ROCE) in the high teens.The main focus, as of now, continues to be on increasing market share, and toward that end, the company recently slashed tariffs on numerous plans. The management pointed out that cut in tariff was a response to the incumbents’ price action to close the gap with Jio. It also indicated that Jio will not shy away from reducing prices further in order to maintain that gap in the event of the incumbents cutting their tariffs further.During the quarter under review, Reliance Jio announced the acquisition of specified assets of Reliance Communications and its affiliates. The management noted that these assets are strategic in nature and would help the carrier during its planned large-scale rollout of wireless and Fiber to Home and Enterprise services.In terms of valuation, based on the DCF (discretionary cash flow) method, Jio’s value is currently around Rs 245 per share. As the company's earnings gathers more and more momentum, investors can look forward to RIL unlocking value for its telecom venture.We believe that Jio would continue to maintain growth momentum on the back of a smart business strategy, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.Follow @agrawantFor more research articles, visit the Moneycontrol Research Page.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-01-02,"Reliance Industries today said it has commissioned the world's largest refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex at Jamnagar which will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals.The ROGC is part of the USD 11 billion capital expenditure RIL had announced in one of the largest brownfield expansion of energy and petrochemical projects globally.In a press statement, RIL said it has ""successfully commissioned and achieved design throughput of the world's first ever and largest ROGC complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum capacity along with downstream plants and utilities.""ROGC uses off-gases from RIL's two refineries at Jamnagar as feedstock.""This innovative approach of integration with refineries provides a sustainable cost advantage, making ROGC competitive with respect to the crackers in the Middle East and North America which have feedstock cost advantage,"" the statement said.The ROGC design is highly flexible and energy efficient. It is the latest addition to RIL's existing cracker portfolio, consisting of cracker facilities at Nagothane in Maharashtra and Hazira, Dahej and Vadodara in Gujarat.There are nearly 270 ethylene plants globally with a combined capacity of over 170 million tonnes per annum. RIL's combined ethylene capacity is now close to 4 million tonnes a year at five of its manufacturing sites.Ethylene from ROGC is used in downstream plants to produce Mono-Ethylene Glycol (MEG) and Polyethylene (LLDPE and LDPE). Similarly, Propylene from ROGC has enhanced the output of the existing Polypropylene (PP) plants at Jamnagar complex to produce high-value co-polymers.""The commissioning of MEG plant marks the completion of the all-round expansion of the polyester value chain post successful commissioning of Para-Xylene (PX), Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA), Polyester filament and Poly Ethylene Terephthalate (PET) plants over last 3 years,"" RIL said.With the commissioning of LLDPE and LDPE plants at Jamnagar along with its existing PE plants at other manufacturing sites, RIL has the capability to produce the entire range of PE grades covering all end-users in the Indian market.RIL said the ROGC complex was built in a record time with about 40 percent lower capital cost compared to the similar projects globally.RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said: ""The world's first ROGC and downstream plants marks a paradigm shift in the profitability and sustainability of RIL's petrochemicals business.""The ROGC complex is built on the core philosophy of deep feedstock integration to establish industry leading cost and efficiency benchmarks.""This world-scale petrochemicals expansion, once again showcases RIL's unique competitive advantage in efficient execution of complex projects and flawless commissioning capabilities, adding yet another jewel to its crown,"" he added.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-10-18,"In recent times, Reliance Industries (RIL) has shifted its focus from traditional to futuristic businesses driven by advanced technology that could improve quality of life and make the business relevant for the future.In light of this, it had launched Jio services last year driven by VoLTE technology, an advanced technology to transfer calls over data networks. On October 17, Reliance Industrial Investments & Holdings (RIIHL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, has acquired a 12.7 percent shareholding (on fully diluted basis) in SkyTran, a technology-driven company focusing on public transportation, with an option to further invest up to $25 million in convertible notes, subject to approval from SkyTran’s board.Road traffic has become one of the biggest menace impacting quality of life and economic development across the globe. SkyTran aims to solve the problem by developing a transport option that is high-speed scalable and available at a low cost.The proposed SkyTran network would consist of computer-controlled passenger pods running on its patented Passive Magnetic Levitation technology and would use advanced technology in information technology, telecom, Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced materials technologies to transport passengers in a fast, safe, green and economical manner.The company’s efforts are visible as it currently has eight approved patents and over 40 patents pending approvals globally, including India.In fact, SkyTran has received funding from well-known names like Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, who are reputed figures in the technology space. It had received funding from the US Department of Transportation as well.RIL's management said it is well-poised to capitalise on its existing business portfolio and capabilities to accelerate development of SkyTran across the world and especially in India with an aim to improve quality of life.Partnership with SkyTran would help RIL continue to achieve its aim of investing in future technology and making its business future relevant in a fast changing world.Follow @NitinAgrawal65NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-12-18,"World's largest oil exporter Saudi Arabia and richest Indian Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries are discussing joint investment in petrochemicals and refinery projects, the Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said.Al-Falih, who has known Ambani for over a decade now, travelled to Udaipur earlier this month to attend the pre-wedding festivities of Ambani's daughter Isha's marriage with Ajay Piramal's son Anand.During that visit, he also held talks with Ambani but choose to tweet about those discussions only this week.In an Arabic tweet, which was translated using online tools, Al-Falih said he was delighted to meet Ambani.At the meeting ""we discussed opportunities for joint investments and cooperation in petrochemical, refining and communications projects.""He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on December 8 and 9.No details of the meeting were available from Reliance.Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry sources said.Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world's fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces.Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co (ADNOC) have picked up 50 per cent stake in a planned USD 44-billion refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.Aramco and ADNOC will together hold 50 per cent stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) refinery and adjacent 18 MTPA petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025.The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery.Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world's third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-09-25,"India will continue to depend on oil as a mainstay of its energy but its oil demand growth will likely slow as the government pushes for cleaner energy and renewables, Harish Mehta, President, Refining & Marketing at Reliance Industries said on Tuesday.India is pushing for intervention to support renewables, grid electrification, and the government is trying popularize natural gas and shared mobility, said Mehta said during the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore.""This will lower down the growth of oil consumption (in India) over the next decades,"" he said.However, oil consumption will still increase to 480 million tonnes by 2040 as the renewable push will not completely halt oil demand growth, he said, citing official statistics.To meet that consumption, India has been boosting its overall refining capacity with first production from its upcoming West Coast refinery expected in 2022.India has plans to add 190 million tonnes per year of refining capacity over the next 10 years to its existing 228 million tonnes per years, he said.""Over a period of time, some additional refining capacity would also come and some of the exports which are happening through the private sector will probably get curtailed and would get consumed in the country itself,"" he said.Mehta said he is optimistic about the possibilities in the Indian retail fuel sector because of a conducive regulatory environment in the country at the moment.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-12-19,"Amid a raging debate on data localisation, richest Indian Mukesh Ambani on Wednesday said ""data colonisation"" is as bad as previous forms of colonisation and India's data must be controlled and owned by Indians.Speaking at Republic Summit here, Ambani, who is chairman of energy-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd, said data of an individual or business belongs to them and not to corporates who could use it to monetise from them.""In this new world, data is the new oil. And data is the new wealth. India's data must be controlled and owned by Indian people and not by corporates, especially global corporations,"" he said.Throwing his weight behind Indian authorities seeking companies to store data locally, he said the Supreme Court has mandated that data privacy is sacrosanct.""Therefore, for India to succeed in this data-driven revolution, necessary steps will have to be taken to migrate the control and ownership of Indian data back to India - in other words, Indian wealth back to India,"" he said. ""Data colonisation is as bad as the previous forms of colonisation.""Data freedom, he said, is as precious as the freedom won in 1947.The government wants companies doing business in India to store all customer data locally. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in April ordered companies to store the ""the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them... in a system only in India"" so as to ensure ""unfettered supervisory access"" for ""better monitoring.""Companies like Google had complained about the six-month deadline.The government too is considering a draft data-security law that requires data centres for all companies be physically located within India. Also under consideration is an e-commerce policy that requires the storage of customer data in India.""Fundamentally, I am a big believer in the power of all of us together rather than a power of few. I think that will differentiate China and India in the long-run. My belief is that a decentralised empowered world where everybody being equal is better off than where few people are in power. That is true for data world,"" he said.Ambani said the world will have to go from aggregator model to a distributor model as he backed those arguing for preventing foreign companies from repatriating and making money off of Indian consumers' data.""Important thing is that data of an Indian belongs to him. It does not belong to a corporation, whether it be Indian or global. The only right that the corporation has is exactly like a bank that if I give you a fixed deposit locker and you put your money. which is your data in my locker, it doesn't become mine that I take that money and gamble on the stock market. If I make gain take it and then say I have given back your Rs 100. It doesn't work like that,"" he said.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-10-29,"Having missed the first three industrial revolutions, India is now in a position to lead the fourth on the back of its vast tech-savvy young population and is on the way to becoming one of the three richest countries in the world, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said on Tuesday.Speaking at the 24th MobiCom conference here, Ambani, who heads the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, said India's digital transformation is ""unmatch and unprecedented"" after it took leadership position from being 155th in wireless broadband technology adoption in just 24 months.Back in the 1990s, when Reliance was building its oil refinery and petrochemical projects, India's gross domestic product (GDP) was around USD 350 billion and had just come out of a severe financial crisis.""Very few in the world thought that our country's prospects were bright. Today our GDP is nearing USD 3 trillion, and India is well on its way to becoming one of the three richest countries in the world,"" he said.Ambani, the richest Indian, said mobile computing as a catalyst is driving massive data consumption – and this has given young Indians a fertile ground for disruptive ideas.Cloud computing and networking technologies have used broadband as a foundational enabler – leading to Indian entrepreneurs starting to make a global impact.""In the next two decades, I can confidently say that India shall be leading the world and shall contribute to the next wave of global economic growth,"" he said.India languished on the fringes during the first two industrial revolutions powered by coal and steam and electricity and oil, respectively, and only started playing catch-up in the computer-driven third industrial revolution, he said.""The fourth industrial revolution is now upon us. It is marked by a fusion of technologies straddling the physical, digital and biological worlds,"" he said. ""I can say with full confidence that India has a chance of not just participating in the fourth industrial revolution, but also leading it.""This is possible because the India of today is remarkably different from the India of yesterday. ""India's vast tech-savvy young population is its key strength. Just imagine the kind of connected intelligence India can create if the power of billion-plus minds is combined!,"" he said.Also, being a democracy that is run on the model of equitable and inclusive growth, it is openly embracing the digital technologies of tomorrow. It is a rich and fertile ground for entrepreneurship and has emerged as the fastest growing start-up base worldwide, he said.""Today, the nation is home to the third largest number of technology-driven start-ups in the world. Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit,"" he added.Ambani said India needs to prepare itself for a period of information and digital abundance, adapt itself to the scorching pace of innovation and learn to collaborate on scale, quickly transform the idea into a breakthrough innovation, shift from a system of time-bound education to a mode of continuous learning and create more employment opportunities than what new and disruptive technologies take away.""We have to groom our children to be digitally-savvy right from school. Schools should train students in 'the four C-s' – critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. These are the skills required to build the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India.""Within a single generation, we can empower and enrich our vast and young human resources to give India a competitive edge in the world,"" he said.Governments, businesses and civil society organisations should put together an ecosystem for massive upskilling of the workforce, he stated.""We now have the opportunity to digitally reinvent all sectors of our economy – be it financial services, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, education, and healthcare. India can leapfrog the competition and lead the world in each of these sectors,"" he said.Ambani said there was a pressing need to create a digital green revolution by encouraging adoption of technologies for water conservation, soil management, precision farming and waste reduction to enhance agricultural productivity.Secondly, there is a need for good quality education to make India's youth a productive asset, he said adding there is also a requirement to make healthcare affordable.Talking about Reliance Jio, his telecom venture that stormed the industry by combining free voice calls and SMS with cheap data, he said India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband.""Jio is determined to move India to among the top 3 in fixed-line broadband, too,"" he said. ""Our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure provides mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fibre footprint.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-08-29,"Anil Ambani-led Reliance group today said it has sent a resolution plan to the lenders of Reliance Naval & Engineering, which has not been servicing its over Rs 9,000 crore debt from over two dozen banks for many months now, and is awaiting their reply.Reliance Naval is the second firm from the Anil Ambani group to become NPAs after Reliance Communication that owes over Rs 45,000 crore to 31 banks apart from China Development Bank and is an NCLT case now.""As far as Reliance Naval is concerned, we are engaged with the lenders. We had given resolution offers to them and the vast majority of the lenders are supportive of a resolution,"" Ambani told reporters here.The company is awaiting the outcome of the lenders' meeting to decide how that will really proceed, he added.Asked about the status of the resolution plan, since the RBI deadline to firm up a resolution plan for stressed companies have ended this Monday, Ambani said, ""You should ask the lenders. Our proposal is in front of them.""In its February 12 circular, the RBI had given banks 180 days starting March 1, to come out with a resolution plan for stressed companies with exposure over Rs 2,000 crore and above. The deadline ended on August 27.The lenders have two weeks to resolve around 70 accounts mostly in the power, EPC and telecom sectors, worth about Rs 3.8 trillion, else will have to be referred to NCLTs for bankruptcy proceedings.To a query on why he chose to resign as director from Reliance Naval, Ambani said, ""as per the Companies Act, one cannot sit on the boards of more than 10 companies, and I have chosen where I want to be.""Defence Naval, which is into defence ship-building, had reported a threefold jump in net loss at Rs 408.68 crore from Rs 139.92 crore in the March 2018 quarter,. For the full year to March 2018, its net loss almost doubled to Rs 956.09 crore from Rs 523.43 crore in previous year.In the March quarter, the IDBI Bank-led lenders consortium had invoked the pledged shares as well as the guarantees available with them after the company stopped servicing the debt.It can be noted that Reliance Naval had informed the regulators in March that its auditors had expressed doubts about its ability to continue as a ""going concern"".In a note in the FY18 earnings statement, its auditors Pathak HD & Associates had raised doubts about its ability to ""continue as a going concern"" citing cash losses, networth erosion, loan recall back by secured lenders, winding up petitions by a few operating creditors among others.The company, which was earlier known as Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering, was bought over by Anil Ambani group in 2016 and renamed it as Reliance Defence & Engineering and later as Reliance Naval Engineering.On the default on payment of NCD redemption amounting to Rs 133.38 crore, Ambani said, ""the default was primarily due to regulatory delays of the MERC.

2018-10-26,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has banned hundreds of major pornography websites such as Xvideos, Pornhub, Xnxx, etc on its network. Though the company is yet to release an official statement, the move was noticed by several Jio users who posted messages on blogs.""I've been trying to load a few of the porn sites but none of them seem to load on the Jio network. Is it just me or are you people facing the same issues?"" a Reliance Jio user posted on Reddit. The thread saw multiple users complaining about similar issues subsequently.Jio subscribers who were trying to access some of the popular porn websites met with a message which says, “You are not authorized to access this web page as per the DoT compliance."" Meanwhile, some users also received a ‘connection error’ message.Though the telco has banned hundreds of pornographic websites, it hasn’t banned all the websites as users could still visit some not-so-popular websites such as porn555.Jio’s decision comes on the heels of Uttarakhand High Court’s judgment on September 28 which directed internet service providers (ISPs) to comply with the Union government's directive to ban several pornographic websites.As per the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) directive, ISPs are required to block close to 800 websites which host pornographic content. Currently, only Reliance Jio seems to have implemented the ban, but it is only a matter of time before the rest of the telcos join the bandwagon.Looking back, this isn’t the first instance when ISPs banned websites hosting adult content. Back in 2015, DoT had directed ISPs in the country to block 857 such websites. The censorship was rolled back soon after the government faced severe criticism which resulted in heated debates on social media platforms across the country.""I reject with contempt the charge that it is a Talibani government, as being said by some of the critics. Our government supports free media, respects communication on social media and has respected freedom of communication always,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad, the then telecom minister was quoted as saying during the rollback.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-09-21,"Reliance Industries Friday said it has permanently shut down its only oil field in the flagging KG-D6 block after production declined to nil. Reliance Industries (RIL) had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.""This is to inform that MA (D26) field in Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KGD6), which is being operated by RIL as an operator of the joint venture consisting of RIL (60 per cent), BP (30 per cent) and NIKO (10 per cent), has ceased production on September 17, 2018,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.Post-cessation, activities related to the safe shutdown of the field are underway.""Production from the field had been under natural decline and facing continuous challenges due to high water production and sand ingress. The field has cumulatively produced about 0.53 trillion cubic feet of gas and 31.4 million barrel of oil and condensate and had no remaining reserves,"" the company said.For Q1 FY19, MA field contributed less than 0.1 per cent in terms of revenue at RIL consolidated level.RIL said the Dhirubhai-26 (D26) oil, gas and condensate deep-water discovery was made in 2006. The discovery was developed and put on production in September 2008.This was India's first deepwater development (water depth up to 1,250 metres), with seven wells tied back through a sub-sea production system to a purpose-built, state of the art dis-connectable turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) production facility.""Relevant governmental agencies have already been informed,"" it added.The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter this year.MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 and D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.Output, thereafter, has only declined.KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 and D3 and MA fields.The shutdown of the MA field coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a FPSO unit, which processes output from the field.Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

India had just 153 million mobile Internet subscribers among its population of 1.3 billion.""Enter Jio, with a speedy 4G network (which it spent billions building out), free calls, and dirt-cheap data (as low as 4¢ per GB). It has since issued a super-low-cost smartphone and is rolling out fixed broadband service as well,"" it said. ""The resulting 'Jio-fication' has been nothing short of revolutionary; with data use surging and Jio's competitors scrambling to match its offerings, the development has jump-started India's digital economy.""The biggest winners, it said, are those in rural areas or of modest means -- farmers, students, and entrepreneurs who finally have in their hands the tool they need to participate in the modern economy.Fortune said the Change the World list recognizes companies that have had a positive social impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy.Considering only companies with annual revenues of USD 1 billion or more, the list measures social impact, business results (profitability), the degree of innovation and corporate integration, it said.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

One of the most common forms of composite in use today is carbon fiber.It is made by heating lengths of rayon, pitch or other types of fiber to extremely high temperatures in an oxygen-deprived oven.

2018-07-27,"Petrochemical-retail-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries will announce its April-June quarter earnings on July 27. Brokerage houses expect the company's petrochemical business to post strong results. Also in focus would be its telecom business Jio.RIL's stock has rallied 21 percent in 2018 on top of a 70.5 percent surge in the previous year. It is Rs 28 away from its record high of Rs 1,138.25 touched last week.Here are key factors to watch out for in June quarter earnings:ProfitBrokerages expect the Mukesh Ambani-owned conglomerate to report stable growth in standalone profit but consolidated profit is expected to get a boost from the Jio business.""We expect standalone net income to remain stable, as gains from a weaker rupee and modestly higher petchem volumes/margins will likely be offset by lower refining margins,"" Kotak said.The research house expects a modest increase in consolidated profit driven by higher contribution from Jio.Prabhudas Lilladher expects standalone earnings at around Rs 8,570 crore due to weak refining margins; factored in $11 a barrel. ""We have factored in refining thruput at 16.9MTPA (Q4FY18 16.7MTPA). However, firm petrochemical spreads and higher volumes will support petrochemicals earnings.""Standalone PAT is expected to increase by 6.1 percent YoY to Rs 8,696 crore as the impact from lower GRM will be mitigated by higher petchem volumes and weaker rupee, HDFC Securities said.Refining businessGross refining margin (GRM) is expected to be in the range of $10-11 a barrel for the quarter against $11 a barrel in Q4FY18.The Singapore Complex GRM was down 6 percent YoY (down 13 percent QoQ) to $6 per barrel in Q1FY19 versus $7 per barrel in Q4FY18 and $6.4 per barrel in Q1FY18.Crude oil price continued to trend upward in April-June quarter Average Brent crude price was up 48 percent YoY and 11 percent QoQ to $74.5 per barrel during the quarter.Motilal Oswal expects RIL to clock GRM of $10.3/bbl due to slightly weak benchmark (premium of $4.3/bbl) while HDFC Securities expects GRM of $10.8 per barrel during the quarter.Petrochemical businessAll brokerage houses feel the petrochemical business will do well in the quarter.""Petchem segment is expected to do better, led by healthy petchem deltas and strong volume growth,"" Motilal Oswal said.Edelweiss said petchem earnings are likely to grow by 6 percent as new capacities ramp up. ""We expect continued benefit from US ethane imports and recently commissioned offgas cracker.""Higher petchem earnings are due to ramp in production from ROGC and Px plants, HDFC Securities feels.Petrochemical business in Q4FY18 grew by 13 percent QoQ and its EBIT by 11.9 percent QoQ.JioJio, which clocked standalone net profit at Rs 510 crore in the March quarter, is expected to show good growth again in June quarter.Kotak estimates Jio's reported profits to increase to Rs 600 crore in Q1FY19 while HDFC Securities expects a revenue growth of 5.4 percent QoQ which would be led by 15 percent subscriber growth to 21.5 crore subscribers and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to grow by 3.4 percent QoQ.Jio in Q4FY18 had clocked 3.5 percent revenue growth and 3.8 percent EBIT growth QoQ.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-07-04,"Reliance Industries share price gained as much as 1.5 percent in morning on Thursday ahead of its 41st Annual General Meeting today. The rally was in addition to 2 percent gains seen in the previous session.The main focus in the AGM would be on its telecom business, Jio, which is expected to be one of key drivers to its earnings going ahead.The AGM will begin at 11 am at Birla Matushri Sabhagar, 19, Sir Vithaldas Thackersey Marg, near Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre, in Mumbai.For the last few years, RIL has made massive Jio-related announcements during the AGM and the trend is expected to continue. Not to forget, the highly-anticipated JioPhone was launched at the same event last year, which was made available for a refundable deposit of Rs 1,500.Reports suggest that RIL could well announce the commercial launch and prices for its broadband venture, JioFiber service.So what is JioFiber and how is it different from other broadband connections?JioFiber is the latest offering from Jio for your home. It offers ultimate broadband experience to surf, stream, game and work, because of its ultra-fast upload and download speeds and effective functioning in merely ""milli seconds"".JioFiber connectivity comes directly to your home unlike in most cases where the fiber reaches only until the building and the last few meters of end connectivity is done using the traditional cable which drastically reduces the speed and user experience due to patches and inferior cable qualities of such patch up.The current offer as listed on the Jio website is the JioFiber preview offer which gives you ultra high-speed internet up to 100Mbps for 90 days along with a monthly data quota of 100 GB and a complimentary access to a host of Jio's premium apps.The stock price rallied more than 7 percent in 2018 so far, on top of more than 70 percent rally seen in the last year.Meanwhile, its subsidiary Reliance Brands has purchased 12.5 percent equity stake in Future101 Design Private Limited (Future101) for Rs 9.5 crore, the company said in its filing.The acquisition of minority stake is in the nature of strategic investment, it added.Future101, incorporated in July, 2013 is engaged in manufacturing, distribution and sale of luxury apparels, etc. in India. Future101 belongs to a similar industry as Reliance Brands Limited. We expect growth in this sector and value creation from this investment.Future101 reported annual turnover of Rs 22.18 crore, Rs 20.85 crore and Rs.17.11 crore in FY 2017-18, FY 2016-17 and FY 2015-16, respectively.""No regulatory approvals were required for the said acquisition of shares. The investment does not fall within related party transaction and none of RIL's promoter / promoter group / group companies have interest in Future101,"" RIL said.At 10:44 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 999.60, up Rs 9.55, or 0.96 percent on the BSE.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-04-20,"About 12,000 permanent employees of Alok Industries are likely to lose their jobs as the company is heading towards liquidation, reported Economic Times.The resolution professional has referred Alok Industries, which owes Rs 29,500 crore to the lenders, for liquidation last Saturday as the 270-day deadline to finalise a resolution plan ended on April 14.Lenders of the company have been looking for a suitable taker, however, in the absence of recovery options, Alok Industries would liquidate under the insolvency proceedings.“While considering the resolution plans, lenders are looking at only the recovery aspect,” Manoj Kumar, partner and head – M&A and Insolvency Service at Corporate Professionals, told the paper, adding that if they feel that an offer does not meet their expectations, they will refuse to approve the resolution plan and the company will go into liquidation.The Company had 11,759 full-time employees as of March 31, 2017, with a total staff strength at 18,000. Staff costs amounted to Rs 283.31 crore in FY18.The firm's liquidation will also affect hundreds of small vendors, service providers and about 2.05 lakh equity shareholders, including public financial institutions and retail investors, who may lose their investments.Earlier last week, lenders to Alok Industries did not approve an offer by Reliance Industries-JM Financial ARC to acquire the bankrupt company. Only 70 percent of the lenders agianst the required 75 percent vote to accept the resolution plan endorsed the revised all-cash offer of Rs 5,050 crore. This amount was just about Rs 100 crore higher than the previous proposal, the report said.In July 2017, the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had admitted insolvency proceedings against the textile company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The consortium of lenders, led by SBI, is claiming dues of over Rs 23,000 crore from Alok Industries.About 81 companies that have already gone into liquidation under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and nearly 100 other companies facing insolvency processes are on the verge of liquidation, according to Corporate Professionals.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-03-19,"Private fuel retailers like Rosneft-owned Essar Oil and Reliance Industries have doubled their market share in last three years, capturing close to 7 per cent of petrol sales and over 8 per cent of diesel sales.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question put to him in the Lok Sabha, said private companies were allowed to sell petrol and diesel in March 2002. From April 2002, fuel pricing was also deregulated.Consequently, Reliance, Essar and Shell set up petrol pumps to directly compete with public sector giants like Indian Oil Corp (IOC). In the initial years, private firms were aggressive in setting up of petrol pumps. However, they slowed down once government control over pricing came back in vogue in 2004-05, and they couldn't compete with subsidised fuel sold by PSUs.The government freed petrol price from its control in June 2010 and the same for diesel was done in October 2014, giving fillip to fuel retailing by private firms.Pradhan said private players had a market share of 3.5 per cent in petrol sales and 3.1 per cent in diesel in 2015-16. This rose to 5.3 per cent in petrol and 6 per cent in diesel in the following year.In 2017-18, private retailers commanded 6.8 per cent market share in petrol sales and 8.2 per cent in diesel, he said.Private retailers sold 5.18 million tonnes of diesel in 2017-18, up from 1.19 million tonnes in 2015-16, he said. Public sector oil marketing companies - IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), saw diesel sales drop from 61.76 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 58.29 million tonnes in 2017-18.During this period, India's fuel consumption grew by an average of 3-4 per cent annually.Pradhan said, in petrol, PSU sales rose from 20.95 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 22.39 million tonnes in the following year before dropping to 21.99 million tonnes in 2017-18. Private retailers, on the other hand, saw petrol sales double - from 767,900 tonnes in 2015-16 to 1.59 million tonnes in 2017-18.India had 61,678 petrol pumps as of January. IOC operates the maximum 26,752 pumps, HPCL has 14,853 and BPCL 14,293 pumps.In the private sector, Essar had 4,275 petrol pumps while Reliance had 1,400 retail outlets. Shell operates 100 petrol pumps.In 2016-17, India's fuel consumption rose 5.4 per cent to 194.6 million tonnes. Diesel at 76 million tonnes is the most consumed fuel, accounting for close to 40 per cent of all petrol products used in the country.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-10-31,"Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Cipla and Bajaj Finance are among 12 names that Axis Direct has named as its Diwali picks for Samvat 2075. The brokerage house sees an upside between 10 and 43 percent in these names.In its report, Axis Direct highlights how the year has been a volatile one, with US-China trade tensions, rising crude prices, depreciating rupee, and debt market liquidity crisis dominating cues that are responsible for a correction in the market. Further, it adds that the gains made in the last year have been wiped off in the last two months.Axis Direct also said the impact of these issues is likely to continue to take a toll.Going forward, a heavy political calendar due to the state elections and general elections will make the market move in a range. This is likely till some clarity emerges on leadership trends at the Centre.“We would suggest investors to use the opportunity given by the correction in the market to load up on marquee growth-oriented stocks backed by proven management,” analysts at the firm wrote in their report.A stronger economy, consistent monsoons and reforms by the government are likely to boost the market in the long term.Here is a list of 12 recommendations made by the brokerage house as Diwali picks.Ashok Leyland | Target: Rs 154 | Upside: 38 percentThe brokerage is betting on factors such as growth in commercial vehicles segment, positive effect on margins due to change in product portfolio, capacity expansion and improvement in margins based on increasing levels of utilisations to help the stock.Bajaj Finance | Target: Rs 2,642| Upside: 27 percentIts investment rationale is based on factors such as continued growth expectations along with steady improvement in return on asset.

2018-12-13,"Telecom tribunal TDSAT on December 13 set aside sector regulator TRAI's rule on predatory pricing for lack of transparency in the guidelines over determining market share and rates of services. The move comes as a major relief to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular (Now Vodafone-Idea Ltd) which had in March challenged the amendment made by TRAI in the Telecommunication Tariff order.""The impugned tariff amendment order is set aside in so far as it changes the concept of SMP (significant market player), non-predation and the related provisions,"" TDSAT Bench comprising Justice SK Singh and member AK Bhargava said in an order dated December 13, 2018.Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal(TDSAT) ordered TRAI to rework the predatory pricing rule within six months.TDSAT further held that segmented offers and discounts offered in ordinary course of business to existing customers without any discrimination within the targeted segment do not amount to a tariff plan and therefore ""need no reporting in manner prescribed for regular tariff plans"".Moreover, instead of reporting of all such discounted offers not falling within the cap of 25 tariff plans, TRAI may call for details of any segmented offer about which it may receive specific complaints.In February 2018, TRAI said it will impose financial disincentive of up to Rs 50 lakh per circle on operators if their service rates are found to be predatory in nature.The amendment was issued after old telecom operators Airtel, Vodafone and Idea alleged that Reliance Jio is offering services at predatory rates.TRAI's rule considered a tariff predatory if in a ""relevant market"" a telecom operator with over 30 per cent market share offers services at a price which is below the average ""variable cost"", with a view to reduce competition or eliminate the competitors.TRAI will arrive at ""variable cost"" after deducting fixed cost and share of fixed overheads borne by the company from total cost incurred by it for running business during the period under review.The regulator has also said that telcos will have to provide services to all subscribers availing the same tariff plan in a non-discriminatory manner.""Since we have found that there was lack of required transparency in arriving at the concept of SMP, non-predation and average variable cost, it is not necessary to discuss other issues raised by the appellants and noted earlier,"" the order said.It said that since concept of predation under the competition laws requires consideration of many issues based on enquiry report and evidence, it would not be proper to adopt a definition which provides ""artificial protection to a telecom service provider who may have the capability and intent to destabilise the sector through predatory pricing before it attains the defined status of SMP.""TDSAT order said that powers and jurisdiction of a statutory authority like the Competition Commission should not be blocked or abridged by issuing order or directions like those impugned which do not have the flavour of a subordinate legislation such as regulations.Telecom operators industry body COAI has indicated that the regulation favoured Reliance Jio, and that the order has distorted the market, placing all other operators at a ""serious disadvantage"".Both TRAI and Reliance Jio had rejected the allegation.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-02-26,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is aiming to cover 99 per cent of the country's population by this Diwali, said a top company official.As part of its expansion plans, Jio has announced the roll-out of Internet of Things (IoT) services in association with Samsung, which will help consumers and enterprises.""We are deploying around 8,000 to 10,000 towers every month,"" said Reliance Jio Infocomm President Jyotindra Thacker. He is hopeful that by September or October (Diwali), the company would reach a coverage of 99 per cent.At present, the company has a subscriber base of 160 million paid customers. Reliance Jio Tareq Amin Senior VP Technology Tareq Amin said: We talked about acquiring 100 million customers in 170 days last year, which was unprecedented.People really doubted our ability to convert from free to paid customers. ""Not only have we converted that, we have largest migration of free to paid services in history. Our network today has 160 million paid subscribers in less than 16 months of operation,"" he added.Through its IoT services, Jio aims to work with the sectors like transportation, weather forecasting and agriculture. It is also exploring the possibility of working with third party developers on IoT.On being asked about as how much time Jio would take to roll out IoT, Amin said, the company needs to create an entire ecosystem for that. Rather than of doing city-by-city launch, we would launch IoT always pan India.We are not waiting for network readiness, but we are awaiting maturity of the IoT platform, he said. Amin further said thay Jio's network would surpass 2G coverage. Our coverage in LTE would surpass 2G coverage. We want to connect every person and every village,"" Amin added.India ranked 154th in the world in mobile internet penetration and today it is number one in the data consumption. We believe that today we have the largest data consumption network in the world and largest video consumption network in the world, said Amin at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018.Over switching of Jio's network from 4G to 5G, he said that it could be done by software upgrade, only saying that it was a network built for the future. ""For any network in this world, this migration would be a forklift activity. It's a nightmare,"" he said.In Jio network architecture, we built this software defining network from day zero, he added.  Jio Infocomm, which has already introduced IoT services in Mumbai, now has plans to roll out pan India. Yesterday, Jio Infocomm and Samsung Electronics had announced to work together to set up a nationwide IoT network.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

Reliance officials were not available for immediate comment.Reliance had offered the long-range tanker size cargo for end-August loading from Sikka Port in western India through a tender which closes on Wednesday.But the cargo contains 100 parts per million (ppm) of total oxygenates, twice the acceptable amount for making petrochemicals.The fuel, however, could still be used but only if buyers have the means to lower the oxygenates levels.Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, has already sold one such cargo with 100 ppm oxygenates to Vitol for early August loading at discounts to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.Traders said the off-specification cargoes came at a time when European naphtha arriving next month in Asia was lower versus July.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-11-27,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on November 27 pulled up Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea over their minimum recharge plans, Mint reported.TRAI's move comes after prepaid subscribers complained saying that the two companies sent messages asking them to mandatorily recharge their accounts to continue using their services despite holding sufficient balance.In a letter, review by the paper, TRAI has asked operators to duly inform subscribers within three days the date on which the validity of an existing plan would expire and how they can opt for available plans including minimum recharge plan using subscriber's available prepaid account balance.Read — Over 250 million users may cut connections on Vodafone Idea, Airtel focus on profitable customersEarlier this month, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea rolled out minimum recharge plans for users to boost their average revenue per user (ARPU) and focus on profitable customers. The telecom companies introduced a host of sub-Rs 100 prepaid packs such as Rs 35, Rs 65 and Rs 95, with a 28-day validity period.The telecom operators hope that the move would help them gear up against their rival -- Reliance Jio Infocomm. Jio's entry in September 2016 with competitive prices, pushed other telecom operators to drop rates, which impacted their topline and profitability.Read — Airtel, Vodafone Idea roll out minimum recharge plans to boost ARPU: ReportIn a post-earnings investors call last month, Airtel's Chief Executive Officer Gopal Vittal had said the company expects prepaid ARPU to start improving by the third quarter of the current fiscal year on account of the minimum recharge plans. He also said that this could lead to a reduction in the company's selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.Vodafone Idea would now have only a total of five plans -- three monthly recharge plans of Rs 35, Rs 65 and Rs 95 along with higher value recharge of Rs 145 and Rs 245. This would simplify its tariff portfolio making it easier for users to understand, the report said.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-05-18,"Anil Ambani-run Reliance Communications today said it is in advanced stages of discussions with Ericsson for settling issues related to unpaid dues outside of the insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. ""We confirm that RCom and Ericsson are at an advanced stage of discussions to expeditiously resolve commercial issues. This will enable Reliance Communications to exit the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) process,"" an RCom spokesperson said in a statement.The spokesperson added that the company is confident to ""expeditiously proceed with its monetisation plan with Reliance Jio and overall resolution plan with the lenders, keeping in mind the interests of all stakeholders"".Earlier this week, the NCLT in Mumbai admitted an insolvency petition filed by Swedish firm Ericsson against RCom and two of its subsidiaries seeking to recover Rs 1,150 crore.Ericsson had signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom's nationwide telecom network but has not been paid for the service.Last September, the telecom gear maker had filed a petition in the NCLT Mumbai bench seeking liquidation of the telecom operator to recover Rs 1,150 crore that RCom owes it.NCLT proceedings can potentially delay RCom's plans to sell assets to lighten its debt load.RCom owes around Rs 45,000 crore to as many as 31 domestic and international banks, including over Rs 10,000 crore to a Chinese lender. Due to mounting losses, the company began to wind down its mobile operations from last November.It was also not servicing the debt for many quarters before that as it was looking to recast the loans but did not materialise and since then many of its creditors had taken RCom to bankruptcy court.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-09-05,"India’s telecom sector might be bleeding money, but foreign investors are increasingly optimistic of the opportunities lurking in the country’s airwaves. Two years after the inception of Reliance Jio, the industry has undergone a transformation of sorts, with smaller players falling to the wayside in light of narrowing margins.Service providers have had to sacrifice their profits to remain competitive. Consumers have been the biggest beneficiaries, with better speeds available at lower costs. A rise in internet penetration has also bolstered the government’s push at digitizing essential public services.Here is a look at how the telecom sector has evolved over the past couple of years.Telecom companies have benefitted from large overseas investments. Foreign direct investment (FDI) into the telecom space stood at $1.25 billion in FY14, accounting for 7.82 percent of the total pool of foreign funds.According to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Annual Report for FY18, telecom has shed its laggard status, cornering $8.8 billion (Rs 63,066 crore) in FDI inflows.In the space of four years, telecom has cornered a large chunk of the inflows, bagging 23.57 percent of the pie. This is the highest among all sectors. Foreign capital flowed into telecom after the government raised 74 percent cap on FDI in the sector in 2013.The rise of Jio has undeniably dented the fortunes of established telecos. Smaller rivals shut shop, while bigger players were forced to merger to consolidate their market position.Jio has chipped away at data tariffs, adding to the onslaught on cash-strapped rivals. Bharti Airtel has managed to incrementally raise its market share in the past three years, as have Vodafone and Idea.Bringing people together since 2016. ❤️@VodafoneIN @Idea #WithLoveFromJio https://t.co/A7iDw6awvKAccording to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the market share of Reliance Jio stood at 18.78 percent as on June 30. In the space of two years, it has built a robust subscriber base by significantly lowering tariffs from the prevailing rates and promoting its services by coupling it with affordable handsets. The price war triggered by Jio’s entry has not abated. Data tariffs have gone down significantly over the past couple of years.""Tariff has been brought down by 93% in Telecom sector ""said Ms Aruna Sundararajan @Secretary_DoT during Seminar on “Empowering India Digitally: Enhancing Broadband Quality & Enabling Consumer Choice"" held in New Delhi today. pic.twitter.com/3Av7wATPyPSource: TRAIAs the number of access points to the internet has gone up over the years, so has the speed. According to TRAI’s MySpeed portal, Jio offers the fastest internet connection among Indian service providers, with an average speed of 17.23 mbps. In contrast, Airtel’s network clocked an average speed of 9.66 mbps across the country. Vodafone and Idea Cellular recorded similar performance metrics vis-à-vis speed at 7.23 mbps and 7 mbps, respectively.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-03-11,"Reliance Foundation, one of the largest private foundations in the country, plans to set up a university for cutting edge research and innovation as well as nurturing future leaders, musicians, scientists and Olympians, said its founder-chairperson Nita Ambani.Speaking at the India Today Conclave last evening, she said sports and education are the two pillars on which 'India tomorrow' will rise.With her husband Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director, in the audience, she delivered a talk titled 'The Great Equaliser: Sports and Education For All'.""Even the world's best and biggest companies have a finite lifespan. But educational institutions are timeless. They live and breathe and grow in the generations whom they empower,"" she said.And that is why, Reliance Foundation is planning to set up a world-class university, she said.""A university at the cutting edge of research and innovation. A university that focuses on education and sports, art and culture,"" she said without giving a timeline for setting up of the institution.The university, she said, will collaborate with the top universities around the world and prepare future generations to face the world, with knowledge and skills.""A university from the gates of which will emerge our future leaders, our musicians, our scientists, and our Olympians,"" she said. ""Building such a university is our dream at Reliance Foundation.""Reliance Foundation was set up in 2010 to provide impetus to various philanthropic initiatives of Reliance Industries, the country's biggest private firm.Ambani said India is home to one sixth of humanity and half of its population is under the age of 25.""One-fifth of all young people in the world are Indians. In the next two decades, while the world ages, India is poised to become younger. India's youth will build India's tomorrow,"" she said. ""Mukesh and I have a big dream and a firm commitment - To make the Right Education, and the Right to Education available to all.""Ambani went on to detail her organisation's efforts to contribute to the development of sports and education in India.Reliance Foundation has established 14 schools, educating over 16,000 children annually.""Our newest two schools are in Uttarakhand. These are the schools that were completely destroyed during the floods in Uttarakhand in 2013, which we have rebuilt now,"" she said.Stating that scarcity of quality teachers and the lack of infrastructure continue to be India's major challenges, she said creative and quality content as well as innovative and cost-effective methods are the need of the hour.Her foundation's grassroots programme had reached out to 13 million budding sportspeople and athletes, she said narrating inspiring stories of young boys and girls who dared to dream and succeeded.She spoke of Anju Gurjar, a young athlete who received a marriage proposal at the age of 15, but won a competition held by the Reliance Foundation and then went on to compete at the national level.She also spoke of the Pandya brothers, Kunal and Hardik (of Mumbai Indians fame), and their humble beginnings.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-11-07,"The sudden announcement of demonetisation exactly two years ago came as a surprise to most. While the jury is still out on whether it was successful in achieving its goals, such as weeding out black money, several stocks have done quite well since.Some, analysts believe, were direct beneficiaries of changes brought on by demonetisation.Over the last two years, the Sensex has rallied 27 percent. Over the same period, as many as 40 stocks more than doubled investors’ wealth.The BSE’s market capitalisation rose from Rs 109.6 lakh crore on November 8, 2016 to Rs 141.67 lakh crore — wealth creation of over Rs 30 lakh crore.Individual stocks that more than doubled investor wealth in the last two years in the S&P BSE 500 index include names like HEG, Indiabulls Ventures, Graphite India, V-Mart Retail, Venky’s India, Adani Transmission, Future Retail, VIP Industries, NIIT Technologies, KEI Industries, ITI, Radico Khaitan, Sterlite Technologies, Rain Industries, Phillips Carbon.In the S&P BSE Small-cap index, as many as 60 stocks more than doubled investors’ wealth in the last two years which include names like Balkrishna Industries, Bajaj Electricals, Jubilant FoodWorks, Bata India, Vaibhav Global, Shakti Pumps, NIIT Technologies, Radico Khaitan, Usha Martin etc. among others.In the S&P BSE Mid-cap index, four stocks which have more than doubled investors wealth include names like Biocon, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, and Adani Enterprises.Some of the companies that have generated superior returns over the last two years have witnessed a change in fundamentals, said Atish Matlawala of SSJ Finance & Securities.He pointed to changes such as pollution concerns in China, which has driven greater investments into India, or rising income in Tier 2 and 3 cities, and higher aspirations of rural India. Others include opening for previously unbanked population, a development partially linked to demonetisation.What should investors do with stocks that have done well?“We would advise investors to keep holding companies, where fundamentals changed and book profits in others,” Matlawala said. “We like companies like HEG, Graphite India, V Mart Retail, Future Retail, VIP Industries, Future Lifestyle, Titan Company, Indiabulls Ventures, and Bajaj Finance. We would advise investors to stay invested in these companies and buy more on dips,” he said.But while demonetisation, along with other reform steps taken by the government (GST, RERA etc) may have aligned well for some sectors and companies, lately, the macro picture has become clouded.The economy has been hit by adverse news on rupee, oil, global yields, bank NPAs and recently, the liquidity issues in the NBFC sector.These issues reflected in equities as well, with increasing volatility also affecting the well-performing stocks.“Macros have witnessed overwhelming headwinds, all within the span of the past six-nine months,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.He added that while economic factors were aiding the companies that have performed well over the past two years, some caution is warranted now.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-09-26,"Two buyers, including a consortium of four funds, have evinced interest in buying or taking a controlling stake in the leftover businesses of Anil Ambani group's embattled telecom arm, Reliance Communications (RCom), a top company official said.The company which exited the flagship wireless businesses due to financial pressures and is also selling its spectrum, is looking to sell off the enterprise-focused offerings including subsea cables, international fixed line and data centres businesses.""We also do have two strategic buyers that are looking at the company today as we speak. We will see where it can go over the next few months,"" RCom's chief executive officer, Bill Barney, told reporters here.He said the buyers will look for either a 100 percent buy or at least a controlling stake. The company is optimistic of having a networth of $1 billion, he said.At the company's annual general meeting earlier this month, Ambani had announced that RCom will be completely exiting the telecom business to concentrate on real estate in future. The proceeds from the sale will go to its creditors, he had said.""Our chairman talked about essentially exiting or withdrawing from the telecom business. He's not going to do this tomorrow, it is going to happen over a time. It may be months, may be years,"" Barney said.He said the two potential buyers will take time for the due diligence, given the unfolding events which have now reduced it to a fraction of the original business.The two buyers include a consortium of four funds which have come together for the bid, he said.Despite the plans to exit, Barney said the company will continue with its investments, pointing out that it plans to invest $100 million in an undersea cable running from Italy to Hong Kong via India. He did not specify the timeline for the investment.It is building its 10th data centre and will add three more in the next three years, he said, without mentioning the exact amount to be invested. The company is also seeking partnerships in other businesses, he said.Barney said the company has sufficient capital to take care of the investments.RCom had to be dragged into the strategic debt restructuring (SDR) after it failed to meet its debt repayment commitments to a group of over dozen banks including Chinese lenders to which it owes nearly Rs 45,000 crore.Under severe financial pressure, the company exited the consumer-facing flagship wireless business late last year and also announced a sale of its spectrum assets to Reliance Jio, whose entry has severely affected the telecom sector.Barney said the 'new RCom' will have a 10th of employees of the original, will serve 10,000 customers and have a debt of Rs 2,800 crore.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-04-21,"The market continued its run for the fourth consecutive week despite volatility in global stocks and crude hit multi-year highs, largely backed by hope of continuity in earnings revival.TCS' healthy Q4 earnings & FY19 outlook, normal monsoon forecast by meteorological agencies and consistent inflow from domestic institutional investors also boosted sentiment in the passing week.The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 0.65 percent to end at 34,415.58 and the 50-share NSE Nifty rose 0.80 percent to 10,564.05.The broader markets outperformed frontliners as the Nifty Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices rallied a percent each. FMCG, Metal and IT indices were biggest gainers among sectoral indices, rising 4-5 percent while PSU Bank lost the maximum, falling nearly 5 percent.After nearly 6 percent rally in four straight weeks, the market is largely expected to be in a consolidation mode in the coming week and even the expiry of April derivative contracts would add to that volatility, experts said.Investors will continue monitoring earnings performance, and crude oil prices and rupee movement going ahead, followed by Karnataka elections next month.""Markets will remain volatile during the next week with impending derivatives expiry and a number of companies’ annual results,"" Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities said.Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities said apart from on-going corporate earning, markets would start factoring the sharp rise in crude oil prices and weak Indian Rupee and its impact on the economy.Brent crude oil futures crossed USD 74 per barrel mark last week, the highest level since late 2014.Jain further said another crucial event coming up next month is the crucial Karnataka assembly elections, any change in political equations would affect market sentiments as Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh go for election thereafter. ""However, even if earnings for the March quarter improve and the market rallies, volatility will return with various state election results and the monsoons are other key drivers.""On Monday, first markets will initially respond to HDFC Bank earning announced on Saturday.Here is the list of 10 key factors that will keep traders busy next week:-EarningsEarnings always play key role to decide the market direction apart from other macro & global factors as so far the stability and recovery in benchmark indices from 2018 lows is largely on hope of earnings revival going ahead coupled with domestic inflow support.March quarter earnings season kicked off on a mixed note as Infosys disappointed the Street with its FY19 EBIT margin guidance and IndusInd Bank reported higher FY17 divergence, but TCS stolen the show by reporting healthy Q4 performance and FY19 outlook.Around 120 companies are going to release their earnings report in the coming week, including big names like Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, Maruti Suzuki, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, Wipro and UltraTech Cement.""Focus will will remain management commentary and guidance for year ahead rather then earnings which in turn will fund-managers re-balancing their portfolio accordingly,"" Rahul Sharma, Senior Research Analyst, Equity99 said.Reliance IndustriesThe most important company to look at next week is Reliance Industries, the oil-retail-to-telecom major, which will declare Q4FY18 earnings on coming Friday.Apart from petrochemical and refinery businesses, telecom is the major component to look for in the January-March quarter earnings of the Mukesh Ambani Group company.Reliance Jio had reported its first ever profit at Rs 504 crore in December quarter 2017 against loss of Rs 271 crore in previous quarter while there was strong petrochemical business performance during the quarter.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.Bharti AirtelThe country's largest telecom operator will release its March quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts largely expect the company to report weak set of earnings due to pricing pressure.""Q4FY18 is likely to be another weak quarter for Bharti. Tariff cuts in January-18, interconnect usage charges (IUC) rate cut on international incoming calls from 53p to 30p from 1st February, 2018 and average revenue per user (ARPU) down trading on account of increasing proportion of bundled plans subscribers to exert pressure on revenues of incumbents,"" HDFC Securities said.It expects company's India wireless business revenue to decline 5.5 percent QoQ and EBITDA 13.5 percent owing to IUC rate cuts, tariff cuts in Jan-18 and ARPU downgrade owing to increased adoption of bundled plans. Outlook on capex and ARPU trajectory would be key investor focus, it said.Elara Capital expects further ARPU decline due to 1) further downtrading among the incumbents’ subscriber base and 2) lower termination charges for ILD termination starting February 1st 2018.""We expect Bharti Airtel to report ARPU of Rs 115.7 – down 7.6 percent QoQ and 27.8 percent YoY. However, we expect India wireless revenue decline to be lower than ARPU decline due to new subscriber addition and expect Bharti’s India wireless revenue to be down only 4.8 percent QoQ as subscriber base reaches 29.98 crore,"" Elara said.Maruti SuzukiInvestors always like Maruti Suzuki (MSIL), the largest car maker in the country, though it is not a heavyweight stock. Most analysts expect the company to report double digit performance on all parameters led by strong volume growth in Q4 following recovery in rural demand, government spending on infrastructure and new launches.""MSIL posted a strong volume growth of around 11 percent YoY which is expected to lead to the revenue growth of 14 percent YoY in Q4FY18. We expect the margins to improve by around 130bps over the last year due to reduction in other expenses as a result of ramping up of Gujarat plant,"" Equirus said, adding key things to look for would be margins and volume outlook.HDFC Securities continued to like MSIL's unique moats, although valuation leaves little room for an upside.""We expect 14 percent YoY growth in topline, aided by 11.4 percent volume and 3 percent net ASP improvement owing to richer product mix (higher share of Baleno and Brezza, with incremental production from the Gujarat Plant). EBITDA margin to expand by 187bps YoY to 15.8 percent led by operating leverage, but flat sequentially owing to Gujarat plant ramp up,"" it said.Crude Oil and Rupee, Bond YieldsApart from earnings, the movement in crude oil prices and its impact on rupee would also be a key thing to watch out for in the coming week.Brent crude, the primary benchmark for international oil prices, increased from USD 72.58 a barrel to USD 74.06 a barrel during the last week, an increase of 2 percent WoW due to geo-political tensions. It is at highest level since late 2014.Crude oil is the most important part of country's import bill as India imports more than 80 percent of its oil requirement. Some analysts feel the crude level up to USD 80 a barrel is not a worrisome for India.""Rising oil prices also pose a threat to the fiscal and current account deficit estimates of the government. Oil price direction will also be determined by OPEC output cuts and US decision on re-introduction of sanctions on Iran by May 12,"" Teena Virmani, Vice President – Research at Kotak Securities said.""Crude also hits the currency as a weak Indian Rupee raises the cost of importing crude oil,"" Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities said.Last week, the Indian rupee hit a 13-month low of 66.10 against the US dollar, after the minutes of the monetary policy panel meeting suggested that they were likely to take a more hawkish tone starting as early as June.Accordind to Teena Virmani, hardening of yields – both globally and domestically may have a negative impact on markets. ""Yields have moved up recently after RBI released the minutes of April monetary policy meeting stating upside risks to inflation which may come from MSP increases, crude price increase and resulting fiscal slippage.""Technical OutlookThe Nifty50 tried hard to reclaim 10,600 level in the passing week, but failed to hit that level due to selling pressure at higher levels.It could be the next immediate resistance for the index followed by 10,660 while on the downside, 10,500 is the immediate support level followed by around 10,460.""Nifty has once again formed a Hanging-Man Candle stick pattern on the daily chart, which is another sign of uncertainty. Going forward, a fresh breakout is likely only if Nifty manages to break and close above the 10,610-10,630 zone, while 10,480 will act as a strong support for Nifty,"" Rahul Sharma, Senior Research Analyst, Equity99 said.Anita Gandhi, Whole Time Director at Arihant Capital Markets said since prices have entered the supply zone of 10,468 to 10,702 there is a probability of a consolidation/correction from current level cannot be ruled out. Stock specific activity is likely to continue going forward.""Any decline below 10,450 in Nifty will trigger a sharp profit booking in high beta sectors and stocks. As for the week, support for Nifty is placed at around 10,460 and then at 10,390 levels, while resistance is observed at 10,640 and then at 10,700 levels,"" Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities said.F&O ExpiryThe futures & options contracts for the month of April are going to expire on coming Thursday and positions will be rolled over to next month.As the Nifty futures ended near 10,600 level and we are approaching towards April series expiry, the market is building support around 10,500-10,400 level. Highest put concentration has shifted from 10,300 to 10,500 levels, which signifies strength in the market.From derivative data the maximum call open interest concentrations at 10,700 calls indicating towards strong resistance for the Nifty moving forward while and 10,500 followed by 10,400 put strike hold with the maximum open interest which should act as major support in expiry week, SMC Global Securities said.The PCR for the passing week closed up at 1.45 as compared from last week which indicates more put writing. India VIX fell by 5.91 percent to 12.93, which suggests limited downside and a consolidative move in the market.In coming week, the research house expects the market to trade in the range of 10,400 to 10,700 with bullish undertone.Corporate ActionStocks in FocusHDFC Bank's Q4FY18 profit grew by 20.3 percent YoY to Rs 4,799.3 crore and net interest income was up 17.7 percent to Rs 10,657.7 crore; the board of directors recommended a dividend of Rs 13 per equity share of Rs 2 each.Axis Bank said board commenced succession process to appoint new MD & CEO, appointed Egon Zehnder Advisory firm to evaluate candidates and to conduct succession process.Indiabulls Housing Finance's Q4 consolidated net profit grew by 22.6 percent YoY to Rs 1,030.4 crore, revenue 25.9 percent to Rs 3,689.7 crore and net interest income rose 22.1 percent to Rs 1,661 crore.Indiabulls Housing Finance has fixed May 3 as the record date for the purpose of payment of interim dividend of Rs 10 per shareSasken Communications' Q4FY18 profit increased 27.5 percent to Rs 26 crore, revenue declined 2.4 percent to Rs 128.7 crore, operating profit rose 31.4 percent to Rs 21.5 crore and margin improved 430 basis points to 16.7 percent QoQ.CIMMCO: India Ratings & Research has revised the long-term rating for the company to 'A+' from 'AA-'.Titagarh Wagons: India Ratings & Research has revised the Long-Term Rating for the Company to 'A+' from 'AA-'.Aro Granite Industries approved an expansion plan.

2018-09-26,"Anil Ambani Group firm Reliance Entertainment refuted allegations that it had signed a pact to finance a film by French actress-producer Julie Gayet, partner of former French president Francois Hollande, in a quid pro quo deal for getting the Rafale offset contract, saying no payments were made to her.Reports had suggested that Reliance Entertainment signed the pact with Gayet's company ahead of Hollande's 2016 India visit and India signing a pact to acquire 36 Rafale fighter aircraft under a government-to-government deal.In a statement, Reliance Entertainment said it has not signed any agreement with Gayet or her company, Rouge International. No payment ever been made by Reliance Entertainment to either of them in relation to the film ""nOmber One"", it said.Opposition Congress has been attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government over the Rafale deal, calling it a scam that favoured billionaire Anil Ambani.Reliance Entertainment, which has financed over 50 international films, said it had ""participated, through one of its partners, a French financing firm, Visvires Capital, in the film project involving famous French actor and director Serge Hazanavicius, and leading French actor Kev Adams"".""Reliance Entertainment has financed just 15 percent of the overall film budget, and paid only 1.48 million euros. The balance cost of the film budget has been financed to the extent of another 15 percent (on identical terms as Reliance) by a leading French investment firm, NJJ Capital, and the balance through sale of TV rights and pre-sales of global territories to a number of parties, tax credits, etc,"" the statement said.The 1.48 million euros was ""paid to Visvires Capital on December 5, 2017, as customary only about two weeks before the release of the film on December 20, 2017. President Hollande had ceased to hold office in May 2017 more than 6 months prior to the said payment"", the statement said.It said the company also received ""300,000 euros from the French producer of the film for providing physical production services for extensive location shooting of the film in difficult mountainous terrain in Ladakh"".""It is deeply shocking that, to serve narrow political interests, baseless allegations have been made by deliberately distorting facts and falsely attempting to co-relate a normal business course payment of a relatively small amount of 1.48 million euros to the supply of 36 fighter jets from France to India valued at nearly 8 billion euros,"" the statement added.Reliance Entertainment said at around the same time, Visvires Capital also acquired for it the rights to remake a hugely popular and successful French movie, 'La Famille Belier', which is going into production in the year 2019.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-09-18,"Reliance Power Chairman Anil Ambani today said the company is looking at inorganic growth through acquisition of stressed thermal coal-based projects.Speaking to shareholders at the company's 24th annual meeting, Ambani said, ""going forward, we are looking at key growth opportunities for the company. One of those is inorganic asset acquisition of stressed thermal coal-based assets through resolution process by lenders or under the NCLT regimes.""He said the company will continue to look at opportunities that will bring value and are growth accretive with strong, stable and conservative financial profile.""Besides acquisition, we are also looking at opportunities in the operation and maintenance (O&M) services for stressed power projects which are under the review petition of the resolution,"" Ambani said.Apart from this, he added, mine development operator service is another growth area considering their experience in this field, and the company being the largest private sector coal mining company.Giving an overview about the coal-based projects in the country, Ambani said, there are 34 projects of nearly 40,000 MW with an investment of nearly Rs 2.5 lakh crore which have either turned NPAs or are on the verge of becoming NPAs.""The stress in coal-based projects is primarily due to lack of long-term fuel supply agreement and PPA with discoms. Nearly 30 generation companies have already turned into NPAs and are now being referred to the NCLT to follow the IBC route for resolution. If there is no resolution, then a large number of these are headed for bankruptcy and liquidation,"" Ambani added.He further said that risk management initiatives taken with respect to 3,960 MW Tilaiya ultra mega power project (UMPP) have paid off well and the company has sold its entire stake in Jharkhand Integrated Power, an SPV created for the development of the project, to the state utility, Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam (JUVNL).""Tilaiya has achieved a key milestone with the transfer SPV along with the bank guarantee. As on the lines of Tilaiya, we are pursuing resolution for 4,000 MW Krishnapattanam UMPP and hope to get fully resolved in the course of this financial year,"" he said.Ambani further noted that for grid stability across the country and states as well as for energy security, there is a need for coal-based power as renewables cannot be a complete alternative.""You need base load power and that can come only from coal or nuclear. Solar is cheaper, but from energy security, grid stability and energy mix, coal-based generation is a must. Also, the government needs to take steps to increase the domestic coal production and reach its target of 1 billion tonne output by 2020,"" he said.Speaking about the 2,400 MW gas-based combined cycle Samalkot project in Andhra Pradesh, he said the company has managed to convert the challenge of the stranded asset into an opportunity by diverting one module of equipment procured for this to the Phase-1 project in Bangladesh.Reliance Power had signed an MoU on June 6, 2015 with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) to set up 3,000 MW integrated combined cycle gas-based power project (in phases) and a 500 mmscfd LNG terminal.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-08-31,"An infrastructure company, predominantly owning large funded assets like road, power and metro rail, aiming to become debt-free is certainly a case worth studying. The company in question here is Reliance Infrastructure, which recently concluded a deal valued at Rs 18,800 crore with Adani Transmission to transfer its lucrative Mumbai power assets.Recently, when Reliance Infrastructure defaulted on its small amount of the debt (NCD), the majority of rating agencies downgraded its debt instrument rating to “D”, which is assigned for the instruments either in default or are expected to be in default soon. The company attributed this to the delays in completion of deal with Adani Transmission, whose proceeds were supposed to be deployed for the payment of interest and debt.Out of debt trapThe Rs 18,800-crore deal is now a reality and company is all set to retire its debt, which has been a big overhang on its performance.  It would significantly improve its credit profile.Last fiscal, the company’s interest coverage ratio fell to 1.16 times as against 1.54 times in FY15 and 1.89 times in FY14. In July this year, the rating agency CRISIL downgraded its Rs 585-crore NCD and Rs 125-crore bond to “CRISIL D”. The report said that financial profile constrained by high ratio of debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, and amortisation) and below-average debt protection metrics.“With a delay in deleveraging plans, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio (including regulated income as part of EBITDA) remained high at around 5.3 times as at March 31, 2018,” said the CRISIL report.While debt servicing is critical, it’s inflating trade payables only added further pressure. Since fiscal 2014, trade payables have moved up from Rs 6,517 crore to Rs 2,2147 crore in FY18. On the contrary, in this period, the receivables have remained in the region of about Rs 5,000 crore. In totality, these numbers explains why rating agencies are worried.Capital allocationThe answer now lies in its capital allocation. It has different businesses, which consumed over rupees one lakh crore capital (Rs 100721 crore) by the end of fiscal 2018.Power business earned an earnings before interest and tax of Rs 4,745 crore or 10% of the assets deployed in the business. Interestingly, the rest of the segments such as EPC, infrastructure and unallocated capital accounted for 54% of the total assets, earned a mere Rs 2355 crore of earnings before interest and tax, which is about 4.3% of the assets. No wonder, its consolidated return on equity stood at 7.8% in FY18. A large part of the capital is not contributing partly because of the nature of the projects and over Rs 13,000 crore are stuck in arbitrations and regulatory recovery accounts. That’s the reason why it is even more important to cut debt.Scope for improvementThe company said that the deal with Adani is expected to reduce its debt by about Rs 13,000 crore to Rs 7,500 crore. That apart, the company has proved arbitration claim of Rs 6,000 crore and regulatory assets Rs 5,000 crore, which are recoverable in the coming months. Taking part of this into account, which is quite possible, it expects to be debt-free by the end of current financial year.Moreover, even after selling the Mumbai power business, it would still be sitting on fairly good assets. The company said that its Delhi power assets are 2.5 times the size of Mumbai power assets making a cash EBIDTA of about Rs 4,000 crore and revenue of about Rs 16,000 crore as against about Rs 8,000 crore of sales turnover in the case of Mumbai power assets.Besides, the management further added that the Mumbai power assets makes an EBITDA of about Rs 1,500-1,600 crore, which is marginal compared to consolidated EBITDA of about Rs 8,400 crore.The company now expects to cut interest cost by about Rs 1800 crore and improve its liquidity and financial profile. It now intend to focus on Delhi Power business, Metro business and 11 completed road assets.The company has invested close to Rs 12,000 crore in the road assets which will throw more cash in the coming year. Further, the management indicated that the E&C business, which is having an order book of close to Rs  27,000 crore should start contributing. Last fiscal, the E&C business reported a sales turnover of Rs 1,559 crore, which the management believes has the potential to reach Rs 5,000 crore annually. The management is optimistic on the potential of the remaining businesses. So post the balance sheet restructuring, if the execution and delivery happens as per management’s guidance, stock could see a re-rating.Follow @jitendra1929NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-08-24,"Five Indian blue-chip companies have driven 97 percent of the stock market's rise to record highs this year, and analysts reckon uncertainty heading into next year's general elections will keep the rally in the months ahead just as narrowly focused.India's broader NSE index has been hitting successive record highs during the past couple months even as worries over the Sino-US trade war dragged other major stock markets down. It is up 10 percent so far in 2018.The BSE index is Asia's top performer for the year, even in dollar terms after accounting for the rupee's nearly 9 percent decline.Yet, a handful of companies led by the country's biggest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services have led that rise in share prices.TCS has been responsible for 35 percent of the rise in the NSE index this year. It became the first Indian tech company to hit the USD 100 billion mark in April and its recent quarterly earnings beat expectations.Reliance Industries became the first Indian company to cross 8 trillion rupees (USD 114.14 billion) in market capitalisation on Thursday. This comes shortly after its valuation hit USD 100 billion in July.Reliance posted a record profit in the March quarter. It contributed 27 percent to the Nifty's rise this year.Analysts believe the top 10 shares by market value will continue to outperform and lead the Indian index, given the backdrop of a weaker rupee and their stronger earnings growth.The rupee hit an all-time low of 70.40 against the dollar last week.The currency weakness and the upcoming general elections are expected to keep the markets volatile and force investors into seeking safer blue-chip companies.""In an election year, investors would obviously stay safe, so they are in large caps,"" said Deven Choksey, founder, KR Choksey Investment Managers. ""The names of biggest contributors might change, but the good quality large cap companies would perform better.""Indian companies reported a 11.6 percent annual increase in profits for the June 2018 quarter, their strongest growth in five quarters, according to data for 560 listed Indian companies. That double digit profit growth comes at a time when Asian peers, such as South Korea and Singapore, missed estimates and reported declining profits.Nearly 52 percent of 430 companies with I/B/E/S estimates available for the April-to-June quarter met or even beat analyst estimates. More than half of the companies missed analyst estimates in the quarters ending March 2018 and December 2017.Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India Research at UBS, said the rally in the top 10 firms had largely to do with the strength in earnings. ""It's about markets sticking to visible growth,"" he said.While TCS trades at a price to two-year forward earnings ratio of 22.58, Reliance Industries is at 14.72. Hindustan Unilever Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Infosys Ltd are the other top contributors to the Nifty's rise so far.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-10-23,"The government is mulling relaxing norms for setting up petrol pumps as it is keen on getting more private players into fuel retailing so as to increase competition.The Oil Ministry has set up an expert committee to recommend easing of fuel retailing licensing rules, the ministry order said.At present, to obtain a fuel retailing licence in India, a company needs to invest Rs 2,000 crore in either hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining, pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.The expert committee will ""look at various issues related to the implementation of existing guidelines for grant of marketing authorisation of market fuels - petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF),"" it said.The panel would include renowned economist Kirit Parikh, former oil secretary G C Chaturvedi, former Indian Oil Corp (IOC) chairman and IIM Ahmedabad Director M A Pathan.It has been asked to furnish its report within 60 days after due consultations with stakeholders.The panel will ""review the existing architecture and extent of private sector participation in retail marketing of major transportation fuels in the country,"" the order said.It will ""identity entry barriers, if any, for expansion of retail outlets for private marketing companies.""State-owned oil marketing companies - Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), currently own most of 63,498 petrol pumps in the country.Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy - formerly Essar Oil and Royal Dutch Shell are the private players in the market but with limited presence. Reliance, which operates the world's largest oil refining complex, has less than 1,400 outlets.Nayara has 4,833 while Shell has just 114 pumps.BP of UK had a couple of years back secured a licence to set up 3,500 pumps but hasn't yet started doing so. Last week, French energy giant Total in a joint venture with Adani Group announced plans to set up 1,500 petrol pumps in the next 10 years.IOC is the market leader with 27,325 petrol pumps in the country, followed by HPCL with 15,255 outlets and BPCL at 14,565 fuel stations.The expert committee will ""assess the need, if any, to further liberalise the existing guidelines for authorisation of private sector marketing companies,"" the order said.A senior oil ministry official said the government is keen on getting more private players in the arena and is willing to relax investment norms as well as the number of permissions needed for setting up a petrol pump.The expert group would make specific recommendations on the nature of amendments required to the existing guidelines for grant of a license to private retailers.The official said more competition would improve services as well as give customer choice.

2018-10-25,"The Nifty50 after sharp gap down opening continued to trade lower throughout the session on Thursday, the last day of October series. Global cues and correction in index heavyweights Reliance Industries and HDFC twins weighed down the market.The index hit fresh seven-month low during the day but managed to show some recovery in later part of the session to close above 10,100 levels. It made small bodied bearish candle on the daily charts, which resembles a 'Doji' kind of pattern.A 'Doji' is formed when the index opens and then closes approximately around the same level but remains volatile throughout the day which is indicated by its long shadow on either side. It appears like a cross or a plus sign.Experts feel the market behaviour indicated that it may be bottoming out for the time being. Hence, the pull back rally could be possible in coming sessions, which could be short lived, they said.The Nifty50 after opening sharply lower at 10,135.05 extended losses to hit an intraday low of 10,079.30. The index managed to recover around 40 points from day's low, before closing 99.90 points lower at 10,124.90.""Bulls once again disappointed as they appears to have succumbed to the volatile nature of global markets as they opened with a gap down before signing off the session with a Doji kind of indecisive formation. But somehow, despite multiple attempts, bears failed to breach 10,100 levels on closing basis as intraday gap down openings are not witnessing follow through selling,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.He said this kind of buying at lower levels may be pointing towards the fact that markets are stretched on the down side and in need of a relief rally which in his opinion, based on technical patterns, shall unfold sooner than later.He further said interestingly some of the momentum oscillators started displaying positive divergence and twin momentum oscillators are in buy mode which usually acts as a leading indicator before market turns. Hence, he will advise traders to bet on a pull back rally for a initial target of 10,400 levels with a stop below 10,100 on closing basis.India VIX gained 2.27 percent at 19.31 levels. Volatility is not cooling down further and that is the concern for the market. It has to go down below 17-16 zones to rescue the bulls after the sharp cut of last two months, experts said.Option data is scattered at all the immediate prices as it is the beginning of new series. On option front, maximum Put open interest (OI) was seen at 10,000 followed by 10,200 strike while Call OI congestion was seen at 11,000 followed by 10,500 strikes. Call writing was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,200 strike while Put writing was seen at 10,000 followed by 10,100 strike.""Nifty index opened negative and remained under pressure for most part of the session to hit a fresh seven-month low of 10,080. However it formed a small bodied candle as it recovered from its lows but follow up was missing at higher levels,"" Chandan Taparia, Associate Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services told Moneycontrol.He said the index has been trading at deep over sold territory with divergence of Mechanical indicators but bounce is being sold and trend is still intact to negative. ""Now till it remains below 10,200 zones, overall weakness could continue towards next major support of psychological 10,000 and 52-week low at 9,952 mark.""On the upside index needs to cross and hold above 10,250 zones to get any sign of temporary relief or bounce back in the market, he feels.Bank Nifty formed a Doji candle as it remained in a range of 200 points after its negative opening. It has been respecting to its major support of 24,650 while on the upside multiple hurdles are restricting its momentum to surpass 25,350-25,500 zones.

2018-06-19,"The Sensex has seen many reshuffles in the past but do you know that of the 31 stocks in the index, 18 have been part of the index since FY08. Of these 18 stocks, three each are from the technology and automobile space. Private banks, consumer and oil & gas have two stocks each, while state-run banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFC), capital goods, metals, telecom and utilities have one stock each in the index.Stocks which have been part of the Sensex for the past 10 years include: Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), ITC, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, Bharti Airtel and NTPC.The reason why we call them ‘Bahubalis’ is because they stood the test of time and maintained their index position for the past 10 years, which saw both a bull as well as a bear cycle.Shares of Maruti Suzuki rallied over 1,000 percent, followed by HDFC Bank (766 percent), TCS (713 percent), and M&M (540 percent) in the last 10 years.Other stocks which delivered multibagger returns include: HDFC, ITC, Tata Motors, Infosys, SBI, ICICI Bank, Wipro, and Reliance Industries.Most companies on the list are market leaders or have a dominant position in their area of operation. It seems hard that they will be displaced unless the company does something drastically wrong. “Stocks being termed as ‘Bahubalis’ suggests they will continue to dominate performance. We feel it is better to make a negative list of stocks which should be avoided. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Wipro and NTPC should be avoided,” Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities, said.Top stocks that are still a strong buy after being a part of the Sensex for the last 10 years:Analyst: Ashish Sharma, Research analyst, Guiness SecuritiesMaruti Suzuki:Maruti Suzuki has been the leader in PV segment over a considerable period of time. While the growth story remains intact, increase in production and improvement in realizations is likely to drive company’s earnings and which is going to get reflected in the company’s growth.Further, going forward - Lowering of Royalty Rates should lift margins. With increasing spending threshold of the consumers, we expect a higher growth and revenues.HDFC Bank:It is the largest private sector bank in India in terms of the loan book. HDFC Bank has 4.5 percent market share in the loan book. The net interest margins (NIMs) are also expected to remain stable at 4-4.5 percent over FY18-20E due to higher credit/deposit ratio and high yield retail segment.Considering the superior growth in advances and better loan mix, the stock should give greater returns to the investors. Viewing the current ramification in PSU banking space, HDFC Bank should largely be benefitted since it will engulf a large customer base and result into phenomenal consistent growth.L&T:Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) is India’s largest and diversified engineering & construction company. The company’s business mix spans a large spectrum—from complex engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts in the hydrocarbon, process, metals and cement sectors to development of infrastructure projects in sectors like ports, roads, metro rail, and airports.Moreover, the government is inclined to making developments in infra space, thereby resulting in a prominent future for it. The order book is extremely strong, favoring the growth factor.TCS:TCS is the current IT leader; it has shown stupendous growth and has also reflected promoter’s confidence by doing two consecutive buybacks thereby making history in the Indian stock market.It also has had a history of issuing bonus shares to strengthen shareholder’s confidence. TCS also became the first Indian company to cross Rs. 7 Trillion Market Capitalization thereby reflecting the inherent strength in the TATA parentage.HUL:Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is India's largest Fast Moving Consumer Goods Company with a heritage of over 80 years in India.On any given day, nine out of ten Indian households use its products, thus showing its reach and market penetration across the length and breadth of the country.Over the period of time, HUL has always maintained premium valuation due to a higher margin of safety it offers to its shareholders backed by strong consumption story.Reliance Industries:Reliance Industries Limited is an Indian conglomerate, which owns businesses across India engaged in energy, petrochemicals, textiles, natural resources, retail, and telecommunications.Reliance is one of the most profitable companies in India and it is also the second largest publicly traded company in India by market capitalisation.RIL is responsible for almost 5 percent of the government of India's total revenues from customs and excise duty. It is also the highest income tax payer in the private sector in India.(Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.)Stocks to Avoid:Analyst: Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNoteONGC:ONGC will be burdened with subsidies going ahead till the time govt gives up control, which is not going to happen anytime soon and therefore it is better to avoid the stock because it will not be able to charge market rates. We believe oil demand will peak by 2021.Wipro:Wipro has underperformed the entire IT sector since last so many years and that underperformance is likely to continue. NTPC operates in a regulated returns environment and hence there is a limit to the upside.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold? Here are some dos and don'tsCopyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The industry saw an attrition rate of 20-25 percent on average in 2017-2018 as Vodafone India and Idea Cellular merged, Bharti Airtel set out to buy Tata Teleservices’s mobility segment and Telenor India and operators Reliance Communications and Aircel headed for the exit.Industry experts feel that the worst is over and companies are looking to hire in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, the report said.""We are over the worst hump and now companies are looking to hire in areas like AI, big data and 4G network expansion. The first two quarters of FY19 saw the worst and that is over,"" Rajan Mathews, Director General of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), told the paper.Read — Telecom sector to create 10 mn jobs in next 5 years: TSSCThe jobs losses in this sector, however, will ease as the industry stabilizes, Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of TeamLease said.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-12-06,"Aditya AgarwalAfter forming a ‘Bullish Divergence’ in the month of October; 2017, Reliance Industries saw decent run up and tested Rs 1180 – 1190 zone.Looking at the daily chart, the said zone coincided with the 50 percent retracement of its entire fall from the top of Rs 1329 to the bottom of Rs 1016.40.During Thursday’s trade, Reliance broke the upward sloping trend line drawn from the swing low of Rs 1016.40 which indicate that the stock is likely to resume its downtrend.Hence, we recommend traders to go short in this counter in a range of Rs 1130 – 1140 with a downside target of Rs 1050 first and in case of further pessimism stock can retest its bottom of Rs 1016. A stop loss for short positions should be placed above Rs 1187.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?

2018-08-26,"Reliance Jio has leapfrogged Vodafone to become the second-largest telecom operator by revenue market share (RMS) in the country. Jio’s disruptive pricing has helped it clock high growth in rural markets, helping it close the gap with market leader Bharti Airtel.According to financial data collated by TRAI, Jio’s RMS has expanded 253 basis points (bps) on-quarter to 22.4 percent at the end of the quarter ended June. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled firm’s rise has been meteoric. It has managed to dislodge established peers less than two years since resuming 4G services in the country.Vodafone’s RMS declined 175 bps to 19.3 percent, while partner Idea Cellular also ceded 106bps to register RMS of 15.4 percent. Bharti Airtel seems to be holding off a slippage in revenue in the light of the challenge from Jio. Its RMS fell only 12 bps on-quarter, at 31.7 percent. Analysts attributed the slight decrease in RMS to Airtel slashing charges on incoming international calls this quarter.However, Airtel’s RMS has rebounded in the second quarter of FY19, according to an analysis of TRAI data undertaken by ICICI Securities. After initially starting out with low-cost tariffs, Jio seems to have turned a corner, and has entered a period of consolidation. Its RMS nearly doubled in Q1, from 11.6 percent to 22.4 percent. After establishing a channel for sustained revenue, Jio has set its sights on Airtel, which has long been the biggest telecom operator in the country.Jio had previously overtaken Idea, but the company has performed strongly in the past quarter as its merger with Vodafone nears fruition. The combined entity will overtake both Airtel and Jio to become the biggest player in the telecom space with an RMS of 35 percent.The price war launched by Jio has led to attrition of customers from both Idea and Vodafone. The duo is awaiting a final clearance from the company law tribunal to formally complete the merger, which has overshot its June-end estimate.Analysts at ICICI Securities noted that Jio’s strong performance in the June quarter can be attributed to C-circles where its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) rose 17.2 percent. Revenue from this segment contributed to 17 percent of the company’s overall AGR.For telecom companies, AGR is the revenue accrued through licensing services. While Jio might have outperformed larger peers in RMS terms, it still has to catch up in terms of its subscriber base. Jio had over 215 million users at the end of June, making it the fourth biggest telco in terms of active users.Since its inception in September 2016, the nationwide 4G network has clocked over 14 percent sequential increase in overall AGR to Rs 7,200 crore in Q1 FY2019. Airtel’s AGR rose 0.9 percent on-quarter to Rs 10,200 crore. This figure is inclusive on 45 days’ worth of revenue from Telenor India, which was acquired by Airtel in May.On this count, both Vodafone and Idea have not fared as well, with their AGR falling to 7.1 percent and 5.2 percent respectively. Their combined AGR for Q1 stood at Rs 11,200 crore. On the whole, the AGR of the telecom sector rose 1.3 percent on-quarter to Rs 32,000 crore. Going by the numbers, Reliance Jio has been the major driver of growth in the industry.The positive movement in AGR is indicative that the telecom is returning to growth, fuelled by a rise in mobile internet penetration. Jio faces renewed competition, with incumbent carriers expanding their 4G network to offer greater speed and bandwidth to lure customers.NSE Invest O Cast episode 18: Investing in gold?
