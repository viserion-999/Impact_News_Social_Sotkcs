2018-10-25,"New Delhi: Having disrupted the mobile telephony market in India with Reliance Jio, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani today said India can be transformed when people get artificial intelligence at just  ₹ 100 per month. By 2020, every phone in India will be a 4G-enabled phone and every customer will have access to 4G connectivity, he said at a session of the India Mobile Congress.On Jio GigaFiber, which is expected to roll out across India by the end of the month, Mukesh Ambani said Jio’s broadband offering can place the country among the top three nations in fixed broadband from a low rank of 135 currently. Full text of Mukesh Ambani’s speech at India Mobile Congress:Honourable Minister Shri Ravi Shankar Prasadji, Shri Manoj Sinhaji,Ladies and Gentlemen,A very warm good morning.Dear Friends,Today, we are living in an India of unprecedented hope and promise..…An India that is poised to embrace an immensely exciting future.Just one data point…In my lifetime, I have always been told that India has the largest number of extremely poor people in the world. But that is no longer the case today.A World Bank report indicates that India will have fewer than 3% of its population living under extreme poverty by 2021.As per a United Nations report as many as 271 million people have been liberated from the prison of poverty in the last decade alone.This is a truly historic achievement and the credit rightly belongs to all our citizens. Today India is among the fastest growing large economies in the world.This has happened due to a combination of force-multiplying factors.Most notable among these is the visionary leadership of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji.During the past five years he has galvanised India. He has launched more number of transformative initiatives than in a comparable period anywhere in the world.An equally important factor is the contribution of Indian entrepreneurs, especially those in the telecom, IT and digital space.Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit.India has moved from 155th rank in mobile broadband penetration to being the number 1 nation in mobile data consumption in the world in less than two years. This is the fastest transition anywhere in the world from 2G/3G to 4G.By 2020, I believe that India will be a fully-4G country and ready for 5G ahead of others. Every phone in India will be a 4G enabled phone and every customer will have access to 4G connectivity.At Jio, we are committed to connecting everyone and everything, everywhere always with the highest quality and the most affordable price.Friends,What gives me special satisfaction is the silent revolution taking place in Rural India.I am personally excited about the promise and prospect of bringing Digital Revolution to India’s villages to agriculture and rural enterprises to women and to marginalized communities everywhere.I am equally excited about connecting millions of small shop keepers in India.The Digital Connectivity Revolution can transform Rural India most comprehensively.In the past eight months alone as many as 50 million villagers have got affordable smartphones.For most of them it is not only their pehla phone but also their pehla radio and music player.Pehla TV, pehla camera and pehla Internet in their lives.Imagine what this 5-in-1 means for the aspirational explosion in India.And imagine how it can transform India when it becomes 6-in-1… with Indians getting the revolutionary power of pehla Artificial Intelligence in their hands.All this at only 100 rupees per month.This combination of connectivity with affordability is unparalleled in the world.I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Government’s BharatNet program in providing high-quality connectivity in some of the remotest areas of our country.This transformation will accelerate as we get ready for a 5G world driven by the pro-active approach of the Government. Today at the IMC, you can experience 5G and its various use-cases in our pavilion. Friends, With JioGigaFiber, we have now begun an ambitious push in fixed broadband through Fiber-to-the-home and premise.Jio is committed to building a deep-fibre network across the country and ensuring that every premise is connected with the highest quality network.All of us are proud that India has become the world’s largest mobile data consuming nation. We now have a similar opportunity to replicate this success in fixed broadband as well.I believe India will rise from a lowly 135th rank to be amongst the top three nations in fixed broadband at a pace that will surprise the world.And from day one, JioGigaFiber will offer complete fixed-mobile convergence where Indians will travel seamlessly between mobile and fixed broadband networks 4G and 5G when on the move and Wi-Fi when indoors. Friends,We can together create a period of unprecedented growth, empowerment, employment and prosperity for everyone across our great nation…… In a future that will be shaped by the fourth industrial revolution……a future founded on the robust pillars of connectivity, computing and data. A future powered by path-breaking digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain, Internet of Things, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. A future of exponential growth and immense opportunities for 130 crore connected Indians. This Revolution will open the floodgates of limitless possibilities for India… and Indians… especially young Indians.I assure you that our Industry will play the role of a catalyst in this mission of propelling our nation towards this bright future.We have to be mindful that data is the most important resource in this new world.And India and Indians will generate humungous amount of data. It is important that we utilise this rich-resource for the benefit of India and Indians, with adequate safeguards. With universal connectivity and extreme affordability, our Prime Minister’s inspiring idea of ease of living for all can now be realised.With world-class digital infrastructure in place, India is now ready to not only embrace but actually lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution.This is because, each one of the 130 crore people of India can now productively participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.We can solve the largest unsolved problems facing humanity right here in India.Let me mention only four.First: The Fourth Industrial Revolution can realise the Prime Minister’s promise of doubling the incomes of 150 million Indian farmers.Second: It can realise the Ayushman Bharat scheme’s promise of bringing healthcare to 500 million people ─ the largest health insurance initiative in the world.Third: It can bring quality education to 200 million students in Indian schools and colleges.Fourth: And not the least it can create more jobs with the digitally-connected and AI-powered marketplace of small merchants and small enterprises ─ which I call new commerce for new India.India will demonstrate the greatest digital transformation in people’s lives in world history.Friends,India will be among the largest digital markets in the world. Every enterprise must have an ‘India First’ vision to participate in this market.We will need to reinvent to grow and nurture this market to its full potential.This will be a win-win for the entire industry, for India and for the entire world.To achieve this, we need a grand coalition – of everyone in the industry, government, civil society and the citizens.I strongly believe that India will enable every citizen to realise her fullest potential on the back of this grand coalition.

For the full year, RIL’s net profit stood at Rs36,075 crore, up 20.6% from 2016-17.A Bloomberg poll of seven analysts had projected RIL to report a net profit of Rs9,379 crore for the March quarter.However, the performance of the telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, remain subdued with the company posting a mere 1% growth in net profit on a sequential basis as the ongoing tariff war, which Jio triggered, brought down its average revenue per user to Rs137 in the March quarter from Rs154 a quarter earlier.“The Arpu (average revenue per user) came down... due to price action earlier in the quarter (March quarter),"" said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy and planning at Jio. “We have had a tariff reduction of about Rs50 over three months, which we have more than made up with subscriber growth.""The total income of the telecom company stood at Rs7,128.66 crore during the March quarter, up from Rs6,880.65 crore during the December quarter.

If others don’t share (their towers) with us, we will roll out (our own),"" Thakur told reporters.V. Shrikant, joint chief financial officer, RIL, said that a bulk of its capital expenditure will happen in building fibre-to-home (internet broadband) network, which the Mumbai-based firm plans to launch in a phased manner. The management declined to give details on the size of investment involved.For the March quarter, revenue from the petrochemicals segment increased 43.9% to Rs38,113 crore, backed by improved margins on polypropylene and downstream polyester products. Volumes rose to 8.8 million tonnes, from 6.2 in the year-ago period. In refining and marketing, segment revenue was Rs93,519 crore, a near 30% increase, propped up by higher benchmark crude prices and inventory gains. The gross refining margin—the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products—was $11 a barrel, lower than an expected $11.2 but outstripping the benchmark Singapore Complex by over $4 a barrel.Organized retail reported a 134.1% rise in revenue, at Rs24,183 crore for the quarter, backed by rapid store expansion.

The segment’s operating margin widened 2.5 percentage points to 17.1% from a year ago.At the Ebit level, the petrochemical business accounted for 57% of RIL’s jump in profit from a year ago. “The GRM (gross refining margin) is slightly lower than we have done (in the past). The story really is in Ebit for the petrochemical business,"" said Srikanth Venkatachari, the company’s joint chief financial officer. RIL’s GRM, or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, was higher than expected at $11.6 per barrel. That was a premium of $4.4 per barrel to Singapore’s benchmark margin. Analysts had expected RIL to post a GRM of $11.5. Average Brent crude price during the quarter was up 16.21% from last year at $66.87 per barrel.The retail business reported a near-doubling of revenues and profits before interest and tax. “The core business could see volume-led and margin-led growth in the coming quarters as capacity additions in petrochemicals are almost complete and gross refining margins could improve due to changes in feedstock,"" said Deven Choksey, managing director of KR Choksey Shares and Securities. “Jio numbers show that it is the beginning of a big success story.

TCS, which closed 0.19% lower at  ₹  1,941.25 per share, was valued at  ₹  7.43 trillion.The surge in RIL share price follows its Q1 results where its standalone net profit increased 18% to  ₹  9,459 crore. TCS, on its part, reported quarterly revenues of over $5 billion for the first time in Q1.RIL shares have beaten the market by a wide margin in the past two months on expectations of a regulatory boost for its refining business and excitement about revenue accretion from its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio’s non-mobile businesses.It’s outperformance in Q1, however, was led by the petrochemical and refining realizations, which reported a 35% year-on-year jump in volumes, helped by the company’s expanded capacity. Revenue at the energy-to-telecom conglomerate rose 56.5% to  ₹  1.4 trillion against  ₹  90,537 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. Its telecom arm Reliance Jio reported a profit of  ₹  612 crore for the June quarter, a 19.9% rise on a sequential basis, on the back of a revenue of  ₹  8,109 crore from its operations, the company said.“Reliance Jio continued to show strong subscriber momentum, in line with our expectation. However, flattish sequential ARPU despite cash back offers and changes to prime membership are surprises.

The consolidation of the industry into about three large operators and an increase in Reliance Jio’s market share will set the stage for the listing of the company.“Many RIL investors don’t understand data services or digital services and many of those who want to invest in digital services may not want to invest in refineries,"" the person cited above said. “At some point, when everything has stabilized, you will have to give investors options to invest where they want to.""“If we keep Reliance Jio as a 100% subsidiary of RIL, some RIL investors are bound to say that they don’t understand digital services.

2018-01-03,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd () is likely to see a big cash-flow boost as projects of over $40 billion start to deliver in full swing this fiscal while capex falls, international brokerage house CLSA said on Wednesday.In a report, CLSA said stabilisation of just-commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) and petcoke gasification projects would boost EBITDA. The downstream expansions called J3 are likely to fully stabilise in early 2018 and should allow almost a full year of benefit to flow in FY2019.Reliance, which completed its capital expenditure cycle, on Tuesday announced commissioning of the world’s largest refinery off-gas cracker complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. ROGC will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals. It is in advanced stage of commissioning petcoke gasification plant, which will convert coal and coke, the lowest-cost fossil fuels, into gas.CLSA said monetisation of the two plants will boost the operating income of the company but full benefits will come only in the next financial year. “Although it has indicated potential annual benefit of $2-2.5 billion, we model a smaller amount of $1.8 billion from these two projects. Stabilization of these projects would give a big boost to oil and gas earnings over 12-15 months,"" it said.Reliance’s telecom venture, Reliance Jio, has achieved a critical mass with a subscriber base of around 160 million. It has also cornered nearly 80% of the 4G smartphone base. The 4G smartphone base will expand as users replace their existing smartphones.“We expect Jio to get to 100 million 4G feature phones by March 2019,"" CLSA said.

Analysts had expected RIL’s GRM to be in the range of $10-10.5/barrel against the $12/barrel it reported a year ago.“We expect Singapore GRM to average $6/bbl, going forward. High oil prices, combined with narrowing light-heavy differential and weak demand, are likely to result in poor refining margins in the near term, though"", said Motilal Oswal Seurities in a note to its investors.Commercialisation of the petcoke gasification plant has been delayed again by about six months and is now due for commissioning by fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Four gasifiers are scheduled for the DTA refinery by Q4FY19 from Q2 FY19 guided earlier while the timeline for another six in SEZ refinery are unclear.“We cut our FY19 EBITDA/PAT by 5%/10%, building the petcoke gasification impact from Q4 (earlier Q3) and slightly lowering our base GRM assumption besides taking higher interest from the depreciation of the rupee"", Emkay Global said in a report.Higher debt and capex also worried investors.

Post-cessation activities related to safe shutdown of the field are underway,"" RIL informed the stock exchanges on Friday.Production from the field had been in natural decline and was facing continuous challenges because of high water production and sand ingress.

2018-08-16,"New Delhi: Jeff Bezos, meet Mukesh Ambani.It’s time the Amazon.com Inc. boss took notice of his real rival in India, the only billion-strong consumer market open to Western tech firms. While Walmart Inc.’s acquisition this year of Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ltd, a homegrown e-tailer, might have given the impression that the battle for India would be an all-American contest, a new national e-commerce policy doing the rounds in New Delhi should disabuse Bezos of that notion.If the draft e-commerce policy becomes law, the oil-to-telecom tycoon who’s India’s richest man will emerge as the most formidable challenger to the wealthiest person on the planet.The core contest comes down to warehouses. Foreign-funded firms aren’t allowed to hold e-commerce inventory in India. That’s a disadvantage for Amazon, since it prevents the firm from fully capitalizing on the strengths of its vaunted logistics operation, seen as one of its most decisive edges in the US.Amazon was hoping that those rules would be loosened, but the proposed e-commerce policy instead calls for harsh controls on even the phantom sellers that Amazon and Flipkart have been using to get around the no-inventory problem. If the new policy is strictly implemented, Amazon, and its preferred resellers, won’t be able to offer deep discounts.Meanwhile, Indian-managed companies like Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ltd will be free to control and improve their supply chains while building a fearsome online presence in partnership with his mobile operator, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.That’s not the only onerous aspect of the policy. The draft speaks of a two-year period after which data generated in India—on social media (Facebook Inc.), via search engines (Alphabet Inc.’s Google), or e-commerce (Amazon)—will have to be stored on local servers. As the Wall Street Journal noted this week, the move is bound to push up costs for Western firms.This new restriction will probably make it to the final law. The Indian central bank is already directing all payment firms like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. to keep their Indian data exclusively in the country by October, so there’s little reason to expect that rules for e-commerce data will be much less stringent.Besides, similar laws already exist in China. Amazon sold its Chinese servers and some other cloud assets to a local partner to comply with Beijing’s local storage rules. Alphabet, which has no data centers in China, is also looking for a local partner to bring its Google Drive and Google Docs to that country, Bloomberg News reported recently.Other aspects of the e-commerce policy may die without Bezos needing to move a muscle. Indian privacy activists will balk at the idea of a “social credit database,"" to be set up—in a very Chinese fashion—by mixing state and non-state citizen data. While the goal of the database is to promote digital lending, there’s no guarantee it won’t be used to stifle dissent.A more problematic suggestion in the draft is that the Indian government would have access to the data stored in India, “subject to rules related to privacy, consent etc"". A proposed Indian data-privacy law is yet to be passed by parliament, and whatever makes it onto the books will in turn be shaped by the Indian apex court’s verdict in a case challenging the constitutional validity of a biometric identification system that the government has rolled out to 1.2 billion Indians.Detractors argue that the biometric database is unsafe, a threat to privacy, and a tool for digital exclusion because the failure rate of authentications is too high. For business, however, the stakes in the central data repository are significant. Fast customer acquisition made possible by the unique ID database helped Reliance Jio sign up 215 million users in just 22 months for its low-priced 4G telecom service. The draft e-commerce rules now promise a single “know your customer"" data portal, akin to Singapore’s MyInfo. This move could help Jio’s payments bank acquire customer deposits cheaply.A report in Factor Daily, an Indian tech news website, gives a detailed account of how executives from Jio and Reliance Industries Ltd., the group flagship, helped shape the “India First"" doctrine of the new e-commerce rules.ALSO READ | Why Reliance Jio, Amazon are two sides of the same coinThe Reliance boss owes it to his shareholders to try to make the most of his home-field advantage. The only way his big telecom investments—already amounting to $36 billion, and counting—will make sense is if Jio can succeed in locking in India’s consumers with a triple play of carriage, content and commerce. Of those three, carriage may drive ubiquity of Reliance’s services and content will bring a sticky audience – but only commerce will make real money.India is pegged to be a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025, and Bezos, Ambani, and the Bansal and Walton families backing Walmart-Flipkart all want a piece of the action. Judging by this first round of regulatory skirmish, it’s the Reliance boss that Bezos needs to worry about most.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/880Pt6EM2GrMlamY7uJMKP/Amazons-real-rival-in-India-isnt-Walmart-its-Reliance.html

2018-08-15,"Singapore: Reliance Industries has declared force majeure on gasoline exports from its Jamnagar site, four people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, causing the profit margin from producing the fuel to jump to its highest since September. The force majeure follows an unspecified issue at a gasoline-producing fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) unit in its export-oriented refinery, two of the people said. That plant can process more than 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and is located in Jamnagar’s special economic zone (SEZ). Reliance filed a statement to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) stating it has shut one of its FCC units and that the unit is expected to restart within two weeks. It added that the rest of the Jamnagar complex is operating normally and it does not expect the shutdown to have any material impact on overall operations. The filing did not say what caused the FCC to shut or comment on the force majeure of gasoline supplies.Force majeure is typically declared when matters deemed beyond a refinery’s control disrupt supplies, allowing it to void some of its contractual obligations to customers. Reliance operates one other refinery in Jamnagar, which mainly meets domestic demand. The people said at least two gasoline cargoes scheduled for this month’s loading from Reliance were affected, one of which was destined for Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. The people declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media. According to ship tracking data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, four gasoline cargoes were scheduled to load from Sikka on to ships chartered by Vitol, Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), Oman Trading International and Royal Dutch Shell since 10 August. Two of the four vessels have been anchored at the port since 13 August, while the other ships are either en route or at a nearby port. The force majeure on gasoline supplies was declared this week and this could last at least eight days, one of the four people said. It was not immediately clear what the issue at the FCC was, but it is expected to be resolved soon, another source said. “This will have quite an impact on the (Asian) gasoline market,"" said a Singapore-based trader, adding that the market was already reacting to talk of trouble at Reliance’s gasoline-making unit even before it declared force majeure.Reliance offered a heavy naphtha cargo for export last month, which traders took as a sign its gasoline-making unit could be hit by glitches. Heavy naphtha is a feedstock for gasoline or paraxylene and Reliance does not usually offer the grade. Asia’s gasoline crack, which measures the profit margin from refining a barrel of Brent crude into the fuel, rose by 30% from Tuesday to $11.55 a barrel, the highest since 20 September.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/WCQDvDJrm9nAkpT3LuK6nO/RIL-halts-gasoline-shipments-from-Jamnagar-site-fuel-margin.html

He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on 8 and 9 December.No details of the meeting were available from Reliance.Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry people said.Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world’s fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces.Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co. (Adnoc) have picked up 50% stake in a planned $44 billion Ratnagiri refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.Saudi Aramco and Adnoc will together hold 50% stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery and adjacent 18 mtpa petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025. The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery.Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world’s third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas.

2018-03-16,"London: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom venture Jio, which catapulted India as the world’s largest mobile broadband data consuming nation in less than two years, was first seeded by his daughter, Isha, in 2011.This was revealed by Ambani, the richest Indian, in his acceptance speech last night after his oil-to-telecom conglomerate, Reliance Industries was presented with the ‘Drivers of Change’ award at the Financial Times ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards.Since the idea first cropped up, Reliance, which owns and operates the world’s largest single location refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, has spent more than $31 billion to break into India’s mobile-phone market.The 2016 upstart, called Jio, dislodged rivals and has emerged as the nation’s No. 4 carrier by offering call services free for life and data transmission at dirt cheap rates.Jio is also gearing up for newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses, and cars to the internet. Ambani said with super-abundant youthful talent, India is poised to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028 — within just a single decade.“The idea of Jio was first seeded by my daughter, Isha, in 2011. She was a student at Yale (in the US) and was home for holidays. She wanted to submit some coursework – and she said, ‘Dad, the internet in our house sucks’,"" he recalled.Ambani said Isha’s twin brother, Akash, at that time stated that in the old world, telecom was voice and people made money on calls but in the new world everything is digital.“Isha and Akash belong to India’s young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world. These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind,"" he said.India at the time was suffering from poor connectivity and a severe scarcity of the most critical digital resource – data. Data was not only scarce, but it was priced artificially high to make it unaffordable to a majority of Indians, he said.Jio transformed all of this by making data abundant and affordable and available in every part of the country. “We launched Jio in September 2016. And today Jio has already become the biggest game changer in India,"" he said.Ambani said while the United States pioneered 1G mobile network, Europe ushered in 2G, and China leapfrogged with 3G, Jio has created the largest greenfield 4G LTE-only data network in the world. “This will make India a leader in 4G in 2019,"" he said.“It took the combined Indian telecom industry 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network. Jio took just three years to build a 4G LTE network, which is much larger and far more advanced. And it is also 5G-ready today.""Jio has made voice-calling free for life and has also made high-quality data available at the lowest price in the world - at almost one-tenth the prices in the US, he said, and the firm acquired more than 100 million customers in just 170 days of launch. This was more than one-and-a-half times the population of the United Kingdom. For the 500 million Indians still using a feature phone and not a smartphone, Jio brought out the “world’s most affordable 4G LTE smartphone"" that is available for free for use with a deposit of Rs1,500, he said.“The result has been stunning: 3 lakh to 5 lakh Indians are daily migrating to Jio Phone. And for the same Rs200-300, they benefit through access to the high-speed internet with their existing voice needs are completely free."" As the internet becomes accessible to all Indians, the country will be among the first to graduate to the Internet of Everything, he said.“Within the next few years, Jio will empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe’s population to enjoy world-class digital services in India,"" he said, adding because of Jio, India has jumped from the rank of 155 to number one in the world in mobile broadband data consumption in less than two years. “Jio has already grown to be the biggest start-up in India’s history,"" he said. The previous honorees for the ‘Drivers of Change’ award include DeepMind Technologies (2016), FANUC (2015), HBO (2014), Alibaba (2013), MONDRAGON Corporation (2012), Amazon (2011), Apple (2010), Fiat (2009) and Ryanair (2008). RIL won it for its “exceptional commitment to innovation-led, exponential growth within the areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and 4G digital services."" Stating that his late father Dhirubhai Ambani was the original ‘Driver of Change’ in India’s business history, he said the legendary industrialist founded Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 1966 with a meager capital of Rs1,000 (about $130 at that time). RIL, which today is an over $50 billion group, has doubled shareholder money every two-and-half years since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1977, he said. “During the same period, Reliance has contributed more to India’s national wealth than any other business group.""",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/GpbrcWLUPrK1BX7ToYBdOJ/Reliance-Jio-was-seeded-by-daughter-Isha-in-2011-says-Mukes.html
2018-10-29,"Singapore/New Delhi: Reliance Industries, currently India’s second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market. Reliance’s refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when India’s oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world’s third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country’s retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations.This push into the domestic fuel market may stumble after India’s government imposed cost controls on Oct. 4 on petrol and diesel prices to rein in recent record highs.Reliance’s shares plunged 6.9 percent on the day of the announcement and are down about 20 percent since their record close on Aug. 28.

(ONGC) in the course of their own drilling activities. The adjacent deepwater fields in question are RIL’s D6 field (KG-DWN-98/3) coast and ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 block, in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin off India’s east coast. RIL and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources Ltd together own the D6 block. “All the contentions of the consortium have been upheld by the majority with a finding that the consortium was entitled to produce all gas from its contract area and all claims made by the Government of India have been rejected. The consortium is not liable to pay any amount to the Government of India,"" RIL said in a filing to the stock exchanges on late Tuesday evening. The petroleum ministry had raised the demand on 4 November 2016, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the “unfair enrichment"" it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC.“An international arbitration panel has issued an award in favour of Reliance, BP & Niko (Consortium) rejecting completely the claims of the Government of India against the Consortium in respect of migrated gas, by a majority of 2 to 1,"" the RIL statement added.While an ONGC spokesperson did not immediately comment on the issue, a petroleum ministry spokesperson couldn’t be reached. According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL, which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL.ONGC has been unable to produce from the deepwater field off the coast of Andhra Pradesh and is scouting for a partner after Norway’s Statoil ASA and Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) quit the consortium. ONGC has been battling concerns over its production capabilities and diminishing yields at its ageing oil fields. Most of the company’s domestic fields are more than 30 years old.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/3zHQg60ZqviuxGSIHh9m1H/Govt-loses-gas-migration-arbitration-against-RIL-and-partner.html

2018-09-18,"New Delhi: India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani plans to build Reliance Jio Hubs, a one-stop shop for all consumer items sold by Reliance Industries Ltd and its units ranging from electronics to groceries, to provide people living in small towns their first mall-like shopping experience. The aim is to leverage the strengths of units Reliance Retail Ltd’s physical stores and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s digital infrastructure to boost sales in smaller towns, which have largely been untouched by modern retail and online shopping.Reliance Jio Hubs is the biggest focus area for the company after Jio GigaFiber broadband services, a person familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity. The Jio Hubs project is in line with Ambani’s vision to bring together telecom, retail and e-commerce to become a technology platform.“It is the chairman’s (Ambani’s) pet project. The company has realized that it has to reach small towns to get big volumes,"" the person said.At Reliance Industries’ annual general meeting on 5 July, Ambani said: “We see our biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform.""“Small towns need assisted e-commerce and the comfort of a physical space where after-sales service is also available,"" said a retail sector analyst, requesting anonymity.“Reliance Jio Hubs could showcase what is available and act like experience centres. Most importantly, these hubs could also hold inventory and act as warehouses as it satisfies the 100% India owned requirement under the draft e-commerce policy.""Under the draft e-commerce policy floated by the government last month, only Indian-owned firms will be allowed to hold inventory.“The company plans to set up close to 800 such Reliance Jio Hubs which will sell all consumer items under Reliance. The investment required for setting these up will be finalized within a month,"" the person cited above said.The plan to reach local markets, know local merchants and local customers assumes significance given a large chunk of Indian population still shops offline.The online retail market in India has more than tripled since 2015, but it is only expected to contribute to 2.9% of the total retail sales in 2018, a June report by researcher eMarketer said.Reliance already has a formidable physical presence in the country with 7,500 stores across 4,400 cities under its subsidiary Reliance Retail. This arm sells grocery, electronics, jewellery and clothes under Reliance Fresh, Reliance Digital, Reliance Jewels, Reliance Trends, among other brands.It also has close to 5,000 Jio Points, which are small 500 sq. ft offices in semi-urban and rural pockets, offering after-sales services and customer assistance.Jio Hubs, on the other hand, would be spread across a much larger area and would capitalize on brand Jio which already enjoys a mass-market appeal and good market share in rural markets given its 4G coverage.“Jio is doing especially well in the rural markets (category B and C circles) because incumbents lag Jio in 4G coverage and also due to the success of JioPhone which has sold 25 million devices by June 2018,"" a 27 August research note by BNP Paribas said.RIL, with a wireless subscriber base of over 215 million, is also gearing up to commercially roll out Jio GigaFiber through which it aims to offer high-speed home broadband to 50 million homes.“We forecast Jio’s subscriber base to rise above 400 million by March 2020.

2018-07-29,"New Delhi: Exactly a decade after it started production, the MA oil and gas field in the Krishna-Godavari basin block (KG-D6) will seize to produce from September, said Reliance Industries Ltd, which has battled quicker than anticipated decline in output at a block that once was its pride. Reliance has till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna-Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA—the only oil discovery in the block—was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and Dhirubhai-3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.“MA field cessation expected by September 2018,"" Reliance said in an investor presentation post announcing June quarter earnings. The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 108,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).Output has been declining since then. It produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter, Reliance said in the presentation. MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic metre per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced a shutdowns.D1 and D3 fields too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd. Output thereafter has only declined.Reliance said KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd, which includes production from both D1 and D3 and MA fields.In April, the Mukesh Ambani-controlled firm stated that “adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields"". While the company had not provided any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields then, it has now said MA field would shut in September. The government’s site restoration guidelines provide for a one-year notice for decommissioning of facilities.The shutdown coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field.Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60% interest, while BP Plc of the UK holds 30% stake. Niko Resources Ltd of Canada has the remaining 10%.Reliance had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of $8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest $2.234 billion, which was scaled down to $1.96 billion in 2012. The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decade’s time.Reliance in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries: R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of  ₹  40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output.

2018-11-25,"You have to give full marks to Vodafone Idea Ltd for trying. When the newly merged company’s management met telecom analysts for the first time last week, it made a fairly logical case for an improvement in India’s telecom industry. They also laboured to point out that the company itself would soon be on a strong footing. The timeline for extracting full synergies from the merger had been advanced by two years, which, coupled with planned asset sales and equity issuances, would bring down leverage substantially, it said.But all that effort was in vain. The day after the analysts’ meet, Vodafone Idea’s shares fell by 8.3%.It isn’t difficult to see why analysts and investors were unmoved by the company’s sanguine outlook. While the gains from synergies were substantial and the leeway provided by the planned fundraise and asset sales can’t be ignored, all of this would amount to nothing unless tariffs rise. It has little choice, but to wait for Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to relent.But Vodafone Idea is confident that tariffs will rise. “Market repair has to happen because one, it is unsustainable; two, it is making India uncompetitive; three, even Jio is burning cash. Ultimately, there has to be a rationale in doing business,"" Balesh Sharma, chief executive officer, Vodafone Idea, said at a press meet.Almost everyone agrees that current tariffs are unsustainable. However, where analysts disagree is whether this is a good enough reason to believe tariffs will rise. “Fundamental logic has not worked in this industry for years,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage. “The company’s reasons for a rise in tariffs are merely statements of hope,"" said another.Reliance Industries Ltd’s investors have been remarkably patient so far with the increase in indebtedness on account of Reliance Jio. In the September quarter, Reliance Jio ended with a 28% revenue market share, close on the heels of both Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea, according to the second analyst quoted above. Reliance Jio is likely to take the lead in the December quarter, if not the March quarter.Analysts weren’t impressed with Vodafone Idea’s hopeful assessment of its balance sheet either. Its assertion that leverage will come down from 14 times Ebitda to five times after accounting for synergy benefits, asset sales and the fund-raise is already being contested. This is simply because the company has used trailing 12-month earnings for its calculations.Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.It makes far more sense to annualize the latest quarter’s earnings to reflect the current state of operations. Using this measure, leverage will reduce from 28.7 times to 6.7 times Ebitda, which is still far above comfort levels.It’s little wonder the company also said “market repair has to happen"".",https://www.livemint.com/Money/ZE66HUSKF9JgAWguKJL9sL/vodafone-idea-fundraising-reliance-jio-tariffs-airtel.html
2018-04-15,"New Delhi: After disrupting the wireless telecom sector, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is set to make fibre-to-home its next battleground with the formal commercial launch likely towards the end of this year.“Jio’s main focus now is fibre to home...it has reached a sizeable base of wireless subscribers at 168 million...all efforts now are to successfully deploy wired internet to homes...the full-fledged commercial launch is likely to be announced on 28 December, which happens to be late Dhirubhai Ambani’s birthday,"" a person familiar with the development said seeking anonymity.Reliance Jio has already initiated beta trials for its wired broadband service across a few locations in the country. It has offered free broadband across regions in New Delhi and Mumbai, with unlimited internet at 100 mbps for a security deposit of Rs4,500.“We are still deprived as a nation from a fixed mobile standpoint...we have only about 18 million connected homes in India...we would like to see at least 200 million,"" Mathew Oommen, president of network, global strategy and service development at Reliance Jio, had said recently at the CNBC’s Indian Business Leaders Awards.Brokerage firm CLSA India expects a Rs4,000-crore boost to Reliance’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in three years on the back of the roll-out of broadband internet services, a Bloomberg report said.The low penetration of wired internet services is another factor that could boost Jio’s efforts. According to Telecom Regulatory of India (Trai) data, as on 31 December, India had only 21.28 million wired internet subscribers, compared with 424.67 million wireless internet subscribers. In the wired internet segment, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) holds a 52.53% market share with 9.38 million subscribers, followed by Bharti Airtel Ltd with a 10.12% market share and Atria Convergence Technologies Pvt. Ltd (ACT) with 6.02% share.Jio’s focus on fibre also comes with the rise in data usage seen in the past year. According to data from Trai, for October-December 2017, the average data usage per subscriber per month was 1,945 MB, much higher than 878 MB in October-December 2016. To cash in on this surge in data, RIL recently announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic, apart from separately buying a 5% stake in film firm Eros International Plc.“Given the huge demand for content, fibre is the better bet than wireless, which can provide only a fraction of the capacity of fibre. Fibre capacity can also be enhanced easily. However, fibre is a tough business: the fibre has to reach every single location physically. That is a nightmare, given the challenges of installing underground fibre. Permissions for digging involve huge costs and delays. However, those who do succeed can expect huge rewards from the market,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at consulting firm ComFirst India, said.Jio’s rival Airtel provides high-speed wired broadband up to 100 mbps to 2.1 million users across 89 cities in India. As of December end, Airtel’s average revenue per user from its ‘Homes Services’ segment was Rs948. Broadband customers account for 93.5% of its ‘Homes Services’ segment.“Wired internet is not a pan-India game, Airtel has consciously only focused on regions where it saw good revenue coming in,"" a person aware of the matter said.Last week, Airtel also upped its game and introduced an all new superfast home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of Rs2,990 with 1,200GB of data. This plan also comes with free subscription to Airtel’s OTT apps—Wynk Music and Airtel TV.Emails sent to Jio and Airtel seeking details of their broadband expansion plan were unanswered till press time.Meanwhile, as bigger players capture the pie in metros, cable TV distribution company DEN Networks Ltd has shifted focus on small towns and will push its broadband offerings across tier 2 and tier 3 cities over the next three years by roping in local cable operators to use their existing infrastructure for last-mile delivery of internet.“The tariff and stress of telcos is as of now is focussed on the main metros. So we have made the game plan for tier 2 and tier 3 cities. We don’t want to be trapped in this (war between telcos),"" DEN Networks chief executive officer S.N. Sharma said in an interview.According to Trai data, there are 156 internet service providers in the country as of December end and even without its formal presence in the wired internet segment, Jio has the lion’s share of overall internet subscribers with 35.9% of the market share followed by Bharti Airtel at 22.12%.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/6Ho3bmzlGZQyJsTxUgUCUK/Reliance-Jio-sees-wired-broadband-internet-as-the-next-battl.html

Of this, the refining-to-retail conglomerate already has shareholder approval to raise as much as  ₹ 20,000 crore through non-convertible debentures.Reliance’s total debt has tripled in the past five years as it borrowed to fuel more than  ₹ 3.3 trillion of spending on a new telecom venture and its traditional petrochemicals business.

2018-10-22,"Mumbai: British oil major BP Plc and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are planning to jointly set up as many as 2,000 petrol pumps in India over the next three years, according to two people aware of the development. The exact arrangement of the venture is being worked out and would be decided in a few months, a Reliance executive, one of the two people cited above, said on condition of anonymity.While Reliance already independently runs 1,343 petrol pumps, BP received a licence to set up 3,500 fuel retail outlets in India in October 2016.India is one of the few major global markets where fuel demand is growing and has attracted attention from foreign fuel retailers seeking to gain a toehold in a country where fuel retailing is dominated by state-run companies.BP is RIL’s partner in its exploration and production ventures in the country. In February 2011, London-based BP bought a 30% stake in 21 oil and gas production-sharing contracts operated by RIL for $7.2 billion. The two are also partners in India Gas Solutions Pvt. Ltd, an equal joint venture for sourcing and marketing of gas in the country. “We had a memorandum of association signed with BP but there was no definitive agreement. However, we will continue to expand our retail footprint and the marketing. It is in line with what we had planned to do,"" V. Srikanth, joint chief financial officer of RIL, said after the company reported its second-quarter earnings on 17 October.On his visit to India last week, Bob Dudley, BP’s group chief executive, said “Our partnership with Reliance is great, we just got to get the right sort of terms here with retailing.""To get a licence to retail auto fuel in India, a company should invest a minimum of  ₹ 2,000 crore in exploration or production, refining, gas or product pipeline, or terminals. RIL has licences to open 5,000 petrol pumps in India and plans to double its market share in the fuel retail segment. It currently has a 6% share in India’s fuel retail market.RIL and BP are planning to set up their retail outlets on the national highways. “Looking at the fuel demand scenario in the country, RIL is optimistic about the retail business. Presence on the highways will be attractive for RIL as it is an underserved segment in the country,"" said the first person cited earlier. During the September quarter, RIL reported 10% and 19% year-on-year volume growth in diesel and petrol sales, respectively.RIL, which had a 12% market share in fuel retailing in 2005, saw its market share slip to less than 0.5% in 2014, by when it had shut most of its petrol pumps after sales plunged as it could not match the subsidized price offered by state-run fuel retailers. RIL had spent  ₹ 5,000 crore in setting up 1,470 retail outlets between 2004 and 2006.State-owned Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), managed to sell fuel below production cost due to government subsidies.But after the government deregulated petrol prices and diesel prices in June 2010 and October 2014, respectively, RIL began reopening its retail outlets in phases, gradually raising its market share to about 5%. At present, Reliance, Essar Oil and Shell India together have a 10% share of the fuel retail market, according to analysts.However, the government’s recent move to cut prices of petrol and diesel by  ₹ 2.50 a litre each, part of it as an excise duty reduction of  ₹ 1.50 per litre and the remaining  ₹ 1 per litre to be absorbed by state-run fuel retailers, could prove to be a dampener for the private sector.As Dudley added, “I think that price controls are a kind of thing that will not be good for the sector in the longer term.""India has 57,312 petrol pumps, and Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL are set to expand their network after a gap of nearly four years, by adding nearly 50,000 fuel outlets over the next three years.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/k2rv0minKHjw2lexia1x1H/Reliance-BP-to-jointly-set-up-2000-petrol-pumps-in-India.html
2018-09-25,"In a market correction, stocks that had rallied the most typically fall more than stocks that are already beaten down. Not so in India’s telecom sector. In the past six trading sessions, shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have fallen 6.2% and 12.5%, respectively, in value. Year till date, these stocks have declined 32% and 62%, respectively. In contrast, shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which houses the mammoth Reliance Jio project, have fallen merely 1.9% in the past six trading sessions. Year to date, RIL shares have gained 34%.RIL isn’t exactly a telco stock; although it is true that a large part of the gains in the stock have accrued because of Reliance Jio’s steady upward march in the industry’s market share tables.In fact, subscriber numbers released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show that the pace of Reliance Jio’s market share growth has accelerated in recent months. The company had relaunched its feature phone called JioPhone in July, which helped its subscriber count grow by 11.8 million in the month. This was much higher than the average monthly addition of 9.5 million subscribers in the previous four months.For incumbents, growth slowed dramatically. In July, Bharti Airtel’s wireless subscriber base rose by just 300,000, while the Vodafone-Idea combine’s subscriber count rose by 600,000. It was the lowest rate of subscriber addition in the past 10 months.As pointed out in this column earlier, with none of the small telcos left to grab share from, Jio’s incremental market share gains are expected to come at the expense of large incumbents. In July, Jio’s subscriber market share rose to 19.6%, taking it ahead of both Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which were operating as separate companies at the time. In March this year, Jio’s market share of 15.8% was considerably below Vodafone’s 18.8% share.Of course, a larger share of Jio’s incremental subscribers are coming from rural areas in recent months, suggesting higher sales of its feature phone. The Arpu (average revenue per user) in this segment is far lower compared to the smartphone segment. As such, revenue growth may be slightly lower than subscriber growth.More importantly, Jio’s growth is coming on the back of an increased thrust on capital spend. Cash burn can be expected to remain at high levels this year as well. “Despite strong network metrics, Reliance spent US$2.5 billion in 1QFY19 alone, taking its telecom outlay to US$42.5bn… Telecom debt is already over  ₹ 0.8 trillion, in our estimate, with total telecom liabilities likely to reach  ₹ 1.9 trillion by March 2019 ( ₹ 1.4 trillion in March 2018) after adjusting for vendor dues, spectrum liabilities and the RCom deal that has begun to close,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients.Of course, some of the spending is related to the company’s other businesses such as home broadband. With such a high outlay, the asking rate for these businesses in terms of revenues and profit is fairly high. So as much as Jio’s fast-paced growth is commendable, investors should also look at cash flows and return ratios while valuing it.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/Imt11oW7DZslusD5fOEjAP/Jios-market-share-zooms-after-it-raises-stakes-with-higher.html

2018-06-13,"Mumbai: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is planning to enter the e-commerce business by combining the best of online and offline shopping experiences, a business model that will require zero cash burn to acquire customers.As part of the plan being put together by two of Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) consumer-oriented units—Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd—the company plans to sign on local merchants, boosting their sales through what is known as O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has pioneered, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, on condition of anonymity.The move is in line with Ambani’s aim to generate half of the group’s revenue from the consumer businesses over the next 10 years. Currently, 80% of the group’s sales come from its traditional oil and gas business. “Demand is going to come from tier 2 and 3 and 4 towns and cities. Then you need to have the ability to deliver at these places,"" said this person.“At present, the cost of delivery will be very high, making this unviable. So, you have to create local markets and be present everywhere, where you know the local merchants and local customers and Jio will have to connect them,"" the person added.An email sent to an RIL spokesperson remained unanswered till press time.Under the O2O model, a consumer searches for the product or services online but buys it through an offline channel. RIL’s plan is to consolidate merchants under an e-commerce platform. The merchants, in turn, will cater to the demand from the untapped markets. This will help the company save on costs by avoiding the discounting game and penetrate areas currently outside the traditional purview of e-commerce companies. “Over a period of time, the company can pass on the demand to the merchant, since the (local) merchant is closer to the consumer,"" said the person cited above.This is where Jio’s role converges with the strengths of Reliance Retail.According to a Reliance executive, the company has a formidable physical presence in the country with 4,000 Reliance Retail stores, about 50 warehouses, and 4,000 Jio points, which will be scaled up to 10,000 over a period of time. “That is going to help us in our e-commerce venture in a big way as each of them is a touch point to sign up merchants, and act as delivery points,"" the person said.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/tJefZpob9rslCfUTxyhL0I/Inside-Mukesh-Ambanis-Reliance-ecommerce-plan.html

RCom’s first priority is to resolve its over  ₹  40,000 crore debt, he added.“We have decided that we will not proceed in this sector. And many other companies have taken a similar call. This is very much a writing on the wall... As we have moved out of the mobile sector, we will monetise at an appropriate stage our enterprise business,"" Ambani said.“Reliance Realty will be the engine of growth for the future of this company,"" Ambani said.Reliance Realty, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RCom will develop Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City in Navi Mumbai. said Ambani, adding that it is an already registered IT and fintech park.

The company is “committed"" to exit these verticals as well to pay off bank debt and will take a call on the same at an appropriate time.At the RCom AGM, Ambani also thanked his elder brother and Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose telecom venture—Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd—bought RCom assets. “It would be most appropriate for me to thank and acknowledge the support (and) guidance extended to RCom, and me personally, by my brother Mukeshbhai Ambani,"" Ambani told shareholders.Speaking of RCom’s debt, Ambani said he is confident of getting a resolution in the next few months, and added that other monetisation measures, including sale of telecom infrastructure and fibre to Reliance Jio, are at an advanced stage of closure. The company is awaiting final approvals for spectrum-sharing and trading from the department of telecommunications.Some of the shareholders appreciated efforts taken by RCom to service its debt, but a few were critical as well. When one such shareholder persisted, a company official patted him on the back, probably pointing to the time constraints. When he complained, Anil Ambani said this is a pat and not a stab, and asked him to continue with the question.But the mention of the controversy surrounding the Rafale fighter jet deal prompted Ambani to stop him from speaking further. “Shaileshbhai, who is a very educated person and comes with non-facts, half-baked facts, untruth, lies, is in my father’s words, a true well-wisher of all of you.

Industry-leading rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd lack the “stomach"" to battle Reliance Industries Ltd’s Reliance Jio, which is luring away users with free voice services and inexpensive phones, Lane and Chen wrote in a report published 10 December.Reliance Jio launched a free-for-life call service last year that triggered a price war and consolidation in one of the world’s most crowded mobile markets. Its free introductory nationwide 4G wireless service started in 2016, instantly roiling the world’s largest telecommunications sector after China’s.Two years later, Reliance Jio—which began charging for data in 2017—has 227 million users and has become profitable as it brings connectivity to remote Indian villages.The ensuing disruption forced smaller operators to quit, merge or go bankrupt. Newly merged Vodafone Idea has toppled Bharti Airtel to become India’s top operator, while Reliance Jio has quickly added subscribers to gain the No.3 spot.Bernstein wrote that it expects Reliance Jio to keep selling its subsidized Jio Phone, the 4G feature phones it sells for a refundable deposit of $23 (about  ₹ 1,500), until it reaches the No.1 position.ALSO READ | Airtel, Vodafone Idea get Trai call over minimum recharge plansBernstein said average revenue per unit (arpu) would probably rise for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea this year as they cancel user contracts that generate little revenue.

2018-04-29,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government’s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever. “Adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields (D1D3 and MA),"" the company said in an investor presentation post announcing its fourth quarter earnings. RIL had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavri basin. Of these, MA—the only oil discovery in the block—began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009. While the company did not provide any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields that have witnessed output drop to a fourth of peak, sources privy to the development said MA field may be shut as early as October after the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field, expires. E-mails sent to RIL and its partner BP Plc of UK, which holds 30% stake, for comments remained unanswered. The government’s site restoration guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities. In the presentation, RIL said “average production of gas (from KG-D6 block in January-March 2018) was 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day and oil and condensate was at 1,865 barrels per day."" The gas output, which was lower than 4.9 mmscmd in the October-December quarter of 2017, was made up of output from D1 and D3 and MA fields. It said this was due to “continuing natural decline"" at the fields. RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of $8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest $2.234 billion, which was scaled down to $1.96 billion in 2012. The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in less than a decade. KG-D6 fields had hit a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down wells. This peak output comprised 66.35 mmscmd from D1 and D3, the largest of the gas discoveries on the KG-D6 block, and 3.07 mmscmd from MA field. Besides the fall in output from D1 and D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped. RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries—R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in KG-D6 block at a cost of  ₹ 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak ouput.

2018-06-15,"New Delhi:Reliance Industries is investing in setting up India’s first carbon fibre manufacturing unit to cater to aerospace and defence needs, the company said in its annual report. The owner of world’s largest oil refining complex will also make low-cost and high-volume composite products like modular toilets, homes and composites for windmill blades and rotor blades. Without giving investment details, Reliance in its latest annual report said it has developed capabilities for 3D printing of wide-range of plastic and metals products. Reliance is developing new business verticals in the petrochemicals business to capture Rs30,000 crore composites market and has plans to produce graphene, enhanced plastics and elastomers, fibre reinforced composites which can replace steel. A composite is an engineered material made from two or more ingredients with significantly differing properties, either physical or chemical. One of the most common forms of composite in use today is carbon fibre. It is made by heating lengths of rayon, pitch or other types of fibre to extremely high temperatures in an oxygen-deprived oven. The resultant rayon strands are spun into a thread, then woven into sheets and mixed with hardening resins to form the various components needed. “RIL is investing in India’s first and largest carbon fibre production line with its own technology—to cater to India’s aerospace and defence needs as well as the specialty industrial applications,"" it said. It had last year acquired the assets of Kemrock Industries to enter the composites business and is focusing on thermoset composites such as glass and carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRPs). “The ability to deliver exceptional strength (similar to or better than steel) at a significantly lower weight is a critical performance attribute of FRPs. Additionally, FRPs can withstand harsh weather, have a long life with minimal maintenance, are corrosion resistant and can be moulded into any shape,"" it said. Composites are used in a wide range of markets and applications: industrial, railways, renewable energy, defence and aerospace. “RIL expects the newly launched Reliance Composites Solutions (RCS) business to be the No. 1 composites player in India,"" the company said. Stating that it will focus on design and specifications driven markets and applications that have the potential to grant better returns, it said the focus areas include wind mill blades and parts for railways and metros, which have exacting standards of performance and safety (especially fire retardant). Also on the radar are carbon wraps to rehabilitate/refurbish India’s old infrastructure—bridges, buildings (for improved seismic performance) and pipes. “RCS will design and administer low-cost and high-volume products such as modular toilets and homes to support the Swachh Bharat Mission, disaster relief measures and Housing for All programmes initiated by the Indian Government,"" the annual report said.

Once the pilot and subsequent trial runs are successful, the company will have to get into separate agreements with central and state governments to set up the infrastructure, according to the terms of the respective governments, he added. “For the prototype, some bits will be imported from the US, while most of it will be made in India.

The strategic investment was made through stock financing, with an option to further invest up to $25 million in convertible notes, subject to the approval of SkyTran’s board.SkyTran, which has partnerships with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), has investments by Eric Schmidt, an American businessman and the former executive chairman of Google, and Timothy Cook Draper, an American venture capital investor.“Reliance, Eric and Timothy if combined will have around 35-40% stake in SkyTran,"" said a second person aware of the terms of deal, also requesting anonymity.

Subsequently, in January 2017, a NITI Aayog panel had cleared the ministry’s proposal to test three rapid transport systems using pod taxis.The three global companies in the fray were Ultra Global PRT, SkyTran and Metrino PRT.Ultra Global is the only company whose technology has been tested and is in commercial use. Its pod vehicles are made of steel, have rubber tyres and run on specially made tracks. The Ultra Global system has been in use at Heathrow Airport in London, and runs at 45km/h.SkyTran’s pod taxis run on its state-of-the-art passive magnetic levitation technology, while Metrino pods are suspended from overhead rails. The SkyTran technology is at the testing stage while Metrino has developed a prototype that was tested in 2007 in Poland, but is yet to be commercially operated.Last year, New Zealand’s Metrino Personal Rapid Transit, however, decided to withdraw and called off its joint venture with an Indian partner after failing to get funds for the project.The approval was given on the condition that the technologies should first be piloted on a 1km stretch, and the bidders will have to execute the testing at their own risk and cost. Furthermore, the government said that the pilot project should be executed in such a way that if it is successful then it can be further extended to 15-20km, and also ensure safety during trial runs.The Niti Aayog expert committee had observed that the energy consumed per passenger km by such rapid transit systems is much lower than other modes of transport.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hytTPYEz6bdKapWUG2gPeO/Reliance-to-decide-site-to-build-Indias-first-pod-taxi-prot.html

To overcome this, Reliance Jio has appointed one liaisoning officer for every state to ensure the roll-out is not delayed.""At the shareholders’ meeting, Ambani said JioGigaFiber would build a home-and-office connectivity platform connecting potentially 50 million homes.However, analysts said it may be challenging for Reliance Industries to meet its 50-million-user target due to last-mile connectivity issues.“The management has admitted that the target of 50 million users on FTTH will be challenging due to issues of last-mile connectivity. However, it is open to tying up with local cable operators to accelerate the penetration,"" said Saurabh Handa and Gaurav Malhotra of Citi Research in their report dated 29 July. The last-mile capex (from kerb to home and set-top box) will be $100-$150 per subscriber, all of which may not be incurred by the firm, Handa and Malhotra said.The capex per subscriber seems high, which will materially alter the payback period for Reliance Jio, Amit Shah, an analyst with BNP Paribas, wrote in a 30 July report.Meanwhile, rival Bharti Airtel Ltd is also trying to push its home broadband offerings in new cities and expand network coverage in key markets such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai ahead of the entry of Reliance Jio.Airtel has also boosted its content by introducing a new home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of  ₹  2,199, with 1,200 GB of data and free subscription to Airtel apps Wynk Music and Airtel TV.

This development supports the country’s imminent need of increasing domestic gas supply and is a firm step towards making India a gas-based economy."" Speaking in London, Bob Dudley, BP Group chief executive, said the move further demonstrated BP’s commitment to India. “Through our partnership, Reliance and BP are able to develop these discovered gas resources efficiently and economically, working closely with the Government of India. These new developments will produce much-needed energy for India’s thriving economy."" The Satellites cluster is a dry gas development and comprises four discoveries with five well subsea development in 1,700 meters water depth, up to 15 kilometers east and southeast of the producing D1D3 fields in KG D6. “The first of the KG D6 projects to be sanctioned, the R-series project, is already in execution phase with all major contracts awarded. The Satellites cluster project will draw on execution synergies with the R-series project being developed concurrently,"" the statement said. India today consumes over 5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas and aspires to double gas consumption by 2022. “Gas production from the integrated development is expected to help reduce India’s import dependence and amount to over 10% of the country’s projected gas demand in 2022; benefiting India and domestic consumers at large,"" it added.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/9u7WwbPgnhE75mGJVM2ZpO/RILBP-sanction-satellite-gas-field-development-in-KG-D6.html
2018-01-16,"New Delhi: India’s Reliance Industries has declared a 30% increase in the installed capacity of its export-focused oil refinery, a government report showed, increasing the size the world’s largest refinery complex.India’s Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) in its October report showed 35.2 million tonnes a year as the installed capacity of Reliance’s refinery in the special economic zone (SEZ) at Jamnagar, in northwest India. That is up from 27 million tonnes, or 540,000 barrels per day (bpd), as of 1 April that PPAC reported in an August 2017 report.The new capacity is the equivalent of 704,000 bpd of crude processing.Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd in 1999. This refinery sells most of its fuels in the local market. The SEZ plant was added in 2008 and turned the entire Jamnagar complex into the world’s largest oil processing site.Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed that Reliance has declared the increased SEZ capacity, which they said the company attributed to debottlenecking, or a by streamlining the processes at the plant.“They have declared enhanced capacity,"" said one of the sources by telephone, without provided details on how the company raised the capacity.Reliance has been consistently operating its export-oriented refinery at a rate higher than the nameplate capacityReliance had no immediate comment on the increase when contacted by Reuters.Although most of the products from the SEZ plant are meant for overseas market, some like cooking gas are sold in local markets.Reliance’s refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades.Reliance, in a presentation to India’s Center for High Technology (CHT), said it wanted to raise the capacity of its Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, sources last year told Reuters.CHT is a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements.

2018-07-04,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s second-largest company by market value, has been on a shopping spree this past year, with a focus on expanding the draw of its consumer offerings.Helmed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, the company has struck at least 12 deals over 12 months with an estimated tab of about  ₹ 28,900 crore ($4.21 billion), according to calculations by Jefferies Group LLC and Bloomberg. Ten of these are related to his consumer business. Ambani has also capitalized on India’s ongoing bad-debt issues with purchases of distressed or insolvent companies including a local textile-maker, a carbon-fiber firm and the wireless assets of an indebted telecom company.For a conglomerate better known for building massive projects including the world’s largest refining complex, this recent acquisitive streak reflects Ambani’s ambition to make his telecom, retail and media offerings as profitable as the legacy petrochemicals and refining businesses. It also traces his pivot toward building an integrated digital offering around carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. with purchases in the entertainment and artificial intelligence-based education space.Some of these acquisitions are basically Reliance “trying to grab content,"" said Deven Choksey, managing director at Mumbai-based KR Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. “If they end up generating enough content, you can be reasonably sure that users will come on their network.""Ambani has also been able to cherry pick debt-laden assets as local lenders scramble to resolve their $210 billion in stressed loans, Choksey said.When Ambani, 61, rises to address shareholders in Mumbai on Thursday analysts are expecting to hear more on how the group will further integrate retail and telecom. Clear e-commerce plans, possibly at the annual shareholder meeting, could become a driver for re-rating the stock, brokerage CLSA said in a July 3 report.Reliance has committed about $1.3 billion to acquisitions in the two years through to 31 March 2019, Jefferies India analysts led by Somshankar Sinha estimated in a report on Tuesday. The count excluded the Rhea Retail Pvt. Ltd. deal and a proposed  ₹ 17300 crore acquisition of spectrum, mobile-phone towers and fiber assets from Reliance Communications — the largest among recent transactions.Overall, Reliance has invested about $53 billion in a range of businesses from telecom, retail and petrochemicals to real estate. Telecom alone has sucked up more than $36 billion.

2018-01-28,"Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will raise as much as $2.2 billion in foreign currency debt to fund the purchase of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom)’s wireless assets, according to two people directly aware of the company’s discussions with lenders. While Reliance Jio hasn’t disclosed the value of the transaction to purchase RCom’s assets, the people cited above said that the deal would be funded through a mix of debt and internal accruals. Reliance Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), will receive funding support from the parent, said one of the two people cited above. “The modality of the fundraising is being worked out and no decision has been made yet.""While requests for comments sent to RIL remained unanswered until press time, a senior company official who did not wish to be named said that all necessary approvals for the RCom deal were in place and the fundraising plans will be finalized in the next few weeks. In December, Jio agreed to buy RCom’s wireless spectrum, media convergence node assets, 43,000 towers, and around 178,000km of fibre network for an undisclosed sum. The deal involves primarily cash payment and an assumption of the deferred spectrum payment liabilities of RCom to the telecom department. In a January report, rating agency Icra Ltd said that any additional debt due to the acquisition will not impact Reliance Jio’s credit profile given the strong backing of its parent. Till 31 March 2017, RIL had invested Rs45,000 crore as equity and Rs33,785 crore as non-cumulative optionally convertible preference shares in Reliance Jio. It has also guaranteed Rs19,232 crore of Reliance Jio’s outstanding debt in the period. RIL owns 99.44% in Reliance Jio. Reliance Jio turned profitable in the quarter ended 31 December, about a year after it started services in September 2016. It reported a profit of Rs504 crore in the fiscal third quarter. “Jio’s profitability is to a large extent related to its low costs since Jio needs to maintain a single 4G network, while its competitors have to manage 2G and 3G networks along with 4G offerings. Going forward, Jio will also benefit from the recent reduction in call termination charges by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India since a vast majority of calls terminate in rival networks,"" said Mahesh Uppal, founder, ComFirst consultancy, a telecom sector advisory firm.In December, Anil Ambani-led RCom had announced a new asset monetization plan and its exit from the strategic debt restructuring programme. Ambani said that his company had agreed to a new debt resolution plan that will see RCom sell its assets—spectrum, fibre, telecom towers and real estate, apart from Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City—and does not entail lenders and bond-holders writing off dues or converting it into equity. Through this process, he hoped to cut RCom’s debt by Rs39,000 crore from the Rs45,000 crore it owed lenders at the end of October, Mint reported in December. Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed.

2018-10-07,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) raised prices of at least seven key petrochemicals in the last quarter to offset higher crude oil prices and counter the effect of a weakening rupee. Bulk chemicals traders, suppliers for RIL’s petrochemical products and analysts tracking the company said it raised prices by 10-21% in the second quarter of this fiscal while year-on-year increase is 17-61%.These products include purified terephthalic acid (PTA), monoethylene glycol (MEG), polyester staple fibre (PSF), partially oriented yarn (POY), polypropylene or high density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear alkyl benzene (LAB).“Its more about the rupee decline and crude price which have increased petrochemicals prices in Asia. There is not much change in terms of demand-supply. Besides, RIL commands the highest premium in the Indian petrochemicals market. If you see pricing for RIL’s key products, it has been consistently going up in past three months,"" an analyst tracking RIL said on condition of anonymity.Crude prices, which have been on the rise, are expected to touch $100 per barrel in a few months. The rupee, on the other hand, weakened further and settled at 73.76 against the dollar on Friday.“Sustained, substantial increase in crude oil prices has pushed up petrochemical feedstock prices over the past few months. Geopolitical situation and expectation of a tighter oil market has further impacted the raw material cost. Globally, petrochemical producers have absorbed a part of the higher feedstock costs while pricing products,"" said RIL in an emailed reply.Analysts tracking RIL said the firm raised PTA prices to  ₹  81,600 a tonne till September against  ₹  50,750 a tonne last September. This August, PTA prices were at  ₹  69,000 a tonne. Prices for HDPE has gone up 24% to  ₹  104,720 a tonne against September 2017.PTA is a raw material used in making multi-purpose plastics. HDPE is used for packaging household and industrial chemicals such as detergents.“RIL has been revising prices upwards for its products. And given RIL enjoys a monopolistic situation in petrochemicals manufacturing, we don’t have an option but to buy from RIL. There is no corresponding increase in demand but RIL has been raising prices,"" said a PTA trader operating out of Mumbai’s Crawford Market, adding he has been a PTA trader with RIL for nearly two decades.RIL is among the top 10 producers for key petrochemicals. Last fiscal, the company saw revenue from the petrochemicals segment increase sharply by 35.5%  ₹  125,299 crore. Operating profit in the segment was up by 63% to its highest ever level of  ₹  21,179 crore.Prices for PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, however, were cut last week. “RIL had been increasing PVC prices for the last six months despite a low demand. Last week, however, the company dropped the prices to  ₹  78 a kilo against  ₹  81-82 a kilo earlier. Despite the price reduction, demand has not picked up,"" said another chemical stockist who operates out of Masjid Bunder in South Mumbai.PVC is one of the most widely used polymers in the world extensively used in industries, building, transport, packaging, electronics and healthcare applications.“In India, despite depreciating rupee and increased crude prices, Reliance has actually reduced finished prices for all its products, net of raw material price increases, to safeguard its customers and maintain the consumer sentiments,"" the company added in the emailed response. Still, the July-September quarter earnings from petrochemicals for RIL look robust. “Earnings momentum is likely to remain strong, in our view. After 19-21% earnings per share growth over FY17-18, we expect stronger 33% growth in FY19F, driven by petchem,"" said Nomura Research in a 27 September report. In January, RIL commissioned its refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity along with downstream plants and utilities, culminating its $16 billion refining and petrochemicals expansion plan that it embarked on in 2014.Commissioning of the plant will help the refiner double ethylene capacity and enter the league of top five petrochemical producers globally, in addition to lowering its fuel cost and boosting profits. There are nearly 270 ethylene plants globally with a combined capacity of over 170mtpa. RIL’s combined ethylene capacity is now close to 4 mtpa at five of its manufacturing sites.",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/ILOWDxbel3o8yb3heKIBzI/Reliance-hikes-petrochemical-prices-to-offset-rising-oil.html
2018-04-06,"New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s disruptive entry in September 2016 led to $10 billion in annual savings for consumers and will expand India’s per capita GDP by about 5.65%, says a report of Institute for Competitiveness (IFC), a Gurugram-based Indian unit of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School.Reliance Jio has made data accessible and affordable, with average prices per GB dropping to Rs10 from Rs152, bringing the internet within the reach of a larger proportion of the Indian population. Such a drastic reduction in data prices has also allowed newer segments of society to use and experience internet for the first time.Reliance Jio is the telecom venture of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd.“As per our calculations, even the most conservative estimate shows that due to Reliance Jio’s entry, the annual financial savings to the consumers would be to the tune of $10 billion,"" said the IFC report. According to the report, econometric analysis shows that through widespread network effects, Reliance Jio’s entry would boost India’s GDP by about 5.65%, if everything else in the Indian economy remains constant.The effect on GDP growth due to higher internet penetration will not just be a contribution of the telecom sector but also the various externalities that arise out of the internet economy, it said.IFC analysed Reliance Jio’s entry to measure the impact of internet penetration on economic growth. The model used data from 18 states from 2004-14 and showed that a 10% increase in internet penetration led to per capita GDP rising by 3.9%, if all else remains constant.“Since Jio’s entry into the Indian telecom markets on September 2016, the face of the industry has not remained the same. It changed the basis of competition by offering free lifetime calling to its consumers in an industry that derived 75% of its revenue from voice,"" the report said.Within six months of Reliance Jio’s launch, India became the highest mobile data user in the world consuming over 1 billion GB data every month as compared to 200 million GB earlier.By the end of 2017, Reliance Jio users on an average consume almost 10 GB data, 700 minutes of voice and 134 hours of video every month.“Data usage in the country has soared. India is now only second to China in terms of app downloads. Such levels of digital consumption were unprecedented a year-and-a-half ago,"" it said.Stating that before Reliance Jio’s entry there were hardly many avenues where such high levels of data could be expended by a consumer, the report said.Reliance Jio offers its consumers a wide bouquet of digital applications that address a variety of consumer needs ranging from education, health, entertainment and banking.“All of these services form a part of the digital platform through which Jio aims to address multiple socio-economic needs of its customers,"" it added.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/BVdtkH8kwZkTKK1zGdmEOP/Reliance-Jios-entry-would-boost-India-GDP-by-565-everyt.html
2018-08-17,"New Delhi: The government on Friday allowed import of petcoke for use as feedstock in some industries, sending shares of cement manufacturers higher. Cement companies, which account for about three-fourths of the country’s petcoke use, were impacted by petcoke-related policy flip-flops, which began with a Supreme Court judgment banning use of the fuel in and around New Delhi last year.The Directorate General of Foreign Trade banned the use of imported petcoke as fuel, but said shipments for use as feedstock in certain industries were allowed.“Import of Petcoke is allowed for only cement, lime kiln, calcium carbide and gasification industries, when used as the feedstock or in the manufacturing process on actual user condition,"" the directorate general of foreign trade said. Shares of cement companies such as Ultratech Cement Ltd , Shree Cement Ltd, Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd rose following the announcement. Shree Cement, one of the country’s significant users of petcoke, saw its shares rise as much as 3.6% to  ₹ 17,898, its highest level this month.Usage of petcoke, a dirtier alternative to coal, in the energy-hungry country has come under scrutiny due to rising pollution levels in major cities.India’s imports of petcoke have declined this year as cement companies substituted some of their petcoke with coal to avoid production delays due to pollution-related policy changes. As the world’s largest consumer of petcoke, India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption of about 27 million tonnes, mainly from the United States.

2018-10-25,"New Delhi: Like technology, leadership in telecom is in a state of flux. Czar comes, czar goes. It was very much at play at the India Mobile Congress, the country’s premier telecom event. Both India’s original telecom czar Sunil Mittal, the man who ushered in the telecom revolution in the country, and the new market pace setter and arch rival Mukesh Ambani were present, but it was the latter who stole the limelight.As the inaugural session ended and Ambani, chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, dashed to the exit, Mittal was seen rushing after him even as a throng of journalists and photographers surrounded the man who had triggered the data revolution. Ambani, India’s richest man, has used profits from Reliance Industries Ltd’s refining business to pump in more than $30 billion to upend the telecom industry, forcing smaller telcos to exit and Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd into a complex merger that has pushed Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd to the No. 2 position.What’s more, Reliance Jio may overtake Vodafone Idea and Airtel to become India’s largest telecom operator by the end of 2018, if the strong pace of subscriber addition continues.With the changing fortunes, the limelight has also shifted. At the mobile congress, Ambani moved from one stall to another in the company of two Union ministers—Ravi Shankar Prasad and Manoj Sinha—followed by an eager crowd. Mittal, whose company reported a 65% drop in quarterly profit later in the day, was mostly in the shadows.In the morning, Mittal and Ambani, along with Kumar Mangalam Birla, took the stage with the ministers for the inaugural session of the second edition of India Mobile Congress that was centred around showcasing the country’s advances in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, Internet of Things, etc. While Mittal was seated between telecom secretary Aruna Sundarajan and Hardeep Puri, the minister for urban development, Ambani was flanked by Prasad on his right and Birla on his left. “I am personally excited about the promise and prospect of bringing Digital Revolution to India’s villages… to agriculture and rural enterprises… to women… and to marginalized communities everywhere,"" Ambani said in his speech. “I am equally excited about connecting millions of small shopkeepers in India. The Digital Connectivity Revolution can transform rural India most comprehensively. In the past eight months alone… as many as 50 million villagers have got affordable smartphones."" All this while, Mittal, once the cynosure of all eyes, sat impassively, watching Ambani. He had seen it all through the opening decade of this century as he rang in the telecom revolution. But the old order changes and now with Jio, Ambani has forced the telecom industry into a fierce phase of consolidation, with only four operators left in the fray for an annual business of  ₹ 1.61 trillion in 2017. In this era, voice calls are free and generate little by way of revenues, while data tariffs are at an all-time low. Telcos are being forced to invest in ramping up their infrastructure, putting company balance sheets under severe strain. Vodafone India chief executive Balesh Sharma admitted on Thursday that the “whole industry is bleeding"" and everybody was looking to get their “costs in order"".Airtel itself is going through a financial slump . Its net profit for the quarter ended 30 September declined to  ₹ 119 crore, while revenue dropped 6.2%.So, when Mittal rushed towards Ambani, he may have been looking for a closure, a brake on the ruinous price wars that Ambani has unleashed on the industry.He sought time to meet Ambani. “Tum bolo na kab milna hai. Abhi aa jao... Main Arun ji (unidentified) ko milne ja raha hoon... If you want, I can come wherever you want,"" Ambani said and left.A meeting between the two titans of Indian industry could well be on the cards, but whether that will help Mittal in this mega battle of the giants remains to be seen.",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/WNuViMc25QyYwr6nRErkVN/Reliance-Jio-rings-in-the-new-setting-the-tone-for-others.html
2018-06-26,"Reliance Retail Ltd is an obvious IPO candidate, if we ever saw one. It has everything investment bankers and IPO investors dream of. It is the largest in its industry (its revenues are nearly double the size of D-Mart), it is growing at a brisk pace (37% growth last year), and it has improved margins (from 4.2% in FY17 to 6% last year). All of the numbers pertain to its core retailing business.But here is the clincher—retail stocks are hot. Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs the D-Mart chain of stores, trades at over six times FY18 revenues and nearly 70 times operating profit. What’s more, its massive rally post listing has rubbed off on other retail stocks.If Reliance Retail goes ahead with an IPO anytime soon, it would be striking while the iron is hot. Brokerages such as CLSA and Kotak Institutional Equities already ascribe an enterprise value of over  ₹  1 trillion for Reliance Retail, and valuations can be far higher on listing. If it’s marketed well, which isn’t asking for much from the Reliance group of companies, the company can be valued at over $20 billion. And a mere 10% float can help it raise roughly over $2 billion. That is nothing to sneeze at—except when you are Reliance Industries Ltd.In fact, analysts say, there may never even be a Reliance Retail IPO. From the sounds of it, the company’s parent has grander plans. Whenever it is ready, Reliance Industries is likely to float a mega IPO of its consumer businesses combined together.Also read: RIL may go for a Reliance Jio IPO in 2-3 yearsIt has been talking about its retail business in almost the same breath as its telecom venture, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, referring to them as “consumer businesses"".“The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold, wherefrom they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits. From a mere 2% in FY 2016-17, Jio and Retail accounted for 13.1% of RIL’s consolidated Segment EBITDA in FY 2017-18. Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade, when we celebrate our Golden Jubilee,"" chairman Mukesh Ambani wrote to shareholders in the annual report.Apart from the fact that the two companies already work closely together—Reliance Retail is the master franchisee for Reliance Jio—the parent also sees a great amount of synergies going forward. For instance, when a Reliance Jio customer wants to shop for groceries online, revenues can stay within the family, if an app can direct him to Reliance Retail’s e-commerce wing. Besides, vouchers that can be used on both platforms can result in increased customer stickiness and cross-selling opportunities for both businesses.Possibly, the company also thinks that a Reliance Retail IPO alone wouldn’t bring much to the table, especially seen in comparison with its overall investments in its non-energy businesses. Capital expenditure in the telecom business stood at  ₹  49,000 crore, or over $7 billion, just last year. This year isn’t expected to be very different. As and when Reliance decides it’s time for outside investors to share part of the burden of funding its grand plans, it would like it to be large enough to recoup a sizeable portion of its own investments. Perhaps, clubbing the telecom and retail businesses may provide the heft needed to raise large amounts and deleverage the balance sheet.And if we were willing to get excited about just retail and e-commerce, imagine how delirious investors would get when more exciting terms such as data, digital services, content, connectivity and cloud are thrown into the mix.But having said all this, it still makes sense for the company to explore a separate listing of its retail and telecom arms. First, the two businesses will attract different sets of investors. The basic tenet for unlocking value in a subsidiary is to attract investors who have an appetite for a specific business vertical, and thereby get rid of the embedded holding company discount. For all we know, if a combined consumer business arm is listed, there will eventually be a demand to split the two divisions.And finally, as the saying goes, ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Why wait for a mega IPO when you can do a large-sized one now? In Reliance’s books, maybe we’re all just thinking too small.",https://www.livemint.com/Money/Zhg8CSgFg78LizyvYHpbhM/Why-RIL-isnt-talking-about-a-Reliance-Retail-IPO.html
