2018-02-05,"Mumbai: Indian steelmakers JSW Steel and Tata Steel have bid for Bhushan Steel & Power which is being pursued by creditors in bankruptcy court, three people familiar with the bidding process said on Monday.At 559.89 billion rupees ($8.75 billion), Bhushan Steel faces the highest claims among a dozen companies pushed to bankruptcy court last year amid a government drive to clear a mountain of bad loans choking credit at Indian banks.India's largest steelmaker JSW Steel has jointly bid with India Resurgence Fund, a partnership between Piramal Enterprises and Bain Capital, the sources said.In addition to this joint bid and Tata Steel's offer, a third group comprising some Bhushan Steel employees also placed a bid for the company, the sources added.There were no details on the size of the bids except one source put the joint JSW Steel bid at as much as 280 billion rupees.A spokesman for JSW Steel did not immediately respond to repeated requests for comment on whether it had placed a bid. Joint Managing Director Seshagiri Rao had previously said the company was interested in five steelmakers in bankruptcy proceedings, including Bhushan Steel.Vijaykumar V. Iyer, the bankruptcy court-appointed administrator for Bhushan Steel, did not respond to repeated requests for a comment. Court-appointed insolvency officials rarely discuss details of cases with the media.A Tata Steel spokesman declined to comment when asked if the company had bid for Bhushan Steel, but said: ""looking at strategic growth is an ongoing process"".googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });Asked about the bid, India Resurgence Fund said it would not comment on ""market speculation"".Bhushan Steel, with an annual steelmaking capacity of 5.6 million tonnes, is one of the biggest producers of cold-rolled steel products used to make cars and consumer goods such as refrigerators and washing machines.ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker which industry sources had previously said was interested in bidding for Bhushan Steel, did not submit a bid, the company said in a statement to Reuters, adding: ""We remain interested at looking at future opportunities in India.""Indian media had earlier reported that JSW Steel and Tata Steel had bid for Bhushan Steel.India, which did not have a formal bankruptcy process until mid-2016, has seen a surge in bankruptcy cases since last year, with over 500 companies currently facing bankruptcy court proceedings.The surge in cases comes after the government changed the law giving greater powers to the central bank, which has so far ordered creditor banks to push nearly 40 companies with loan defaults of nearly 4 trillion rupees ($62.46 billion) into bankruptcy proceedings. © Thomson Reuters 2018(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

Sources said that may include a sale of its Materials Services unit and further cost cuts.FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF: Germany's Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel signed a final agreement on Saturday to establish a long-expected steel joint venture, the European steel industry's biggest shake-up in more than a decade. The final agreement comes after months of negotiations since an initial agreement was announced in September. Both companies hope it will help them respond to challenges in the volatile steel industry, including overcapacity. The largest deal in Europe's steel industry since the takeover of Arcelor by Mittal in 2006, the 50-50 joint venture - to be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel - will have about 48,000 workers and about 17 billion euros ($19.9 billion) in sales.Based in the Netherlands, it will be the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal. It forms the core of Thyssenkrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger's plan to turn his steel-to-submarines conglomerate into a technology company.""The joint venture not only addresses the challenges of the European steel industry,"" Hiesinger said. ""It is the only solution to create significant additional value of around 5 billion euros for both Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel due to joint synergies which cannot be realized in a stand-alone scenario.""Tata Steel Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, in a separate statement, said the joint venture will create ""a strong pan-European steel company that is structurally robust and competitive"".(Also Read: Tata Steel Acquires 72% Stake In Bankrupt Bhushan Steel)The deal comes as European steel makers face tariffs of 25 per cent on their exports to the United States, their biggest market. That might force local market to absorb more volume as a result.Since the tariffs were announced in late May, shares in European steelmakers ArcelorMittal, Thyssenkrupp, Salzgitter and Voestalpine have lost 8 to 17 per cent.FRESH TERMSHiesinger had faced pressure from activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott to extract more commitments from Tata Steel, whose European business has performed worse than Thyssen's since the agreement was first announced, creating a valuation gap.Thyssenkrupp said the deal included ""proper compensation"" for the gap, which it said was in the mid-triple-digit million- euro range: if the joint venture makes a widely expected initial public offering it would get a bigger share of the proceeds.Thyssenkrupp said it also secured the right to decide when a listing might take place, adding the joint venture was aiming for a dividend payout in the low-to-mid-triple-digit million- euro range.The German group also said it now expects annual synergies of 400 million to 500 million euros from the transaction. It said additional synergies were possible through managing capital expenditure and optimising working capital.Tata Steel will remain liable for environmental risks in Britain, where its Port Talbot factory, the least profitable of the joint venture, is based, said Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board.He also said that Tata Steel's Dutch unit would be part of the joint venture's cash-pooling mechanism. That had been a key demand for German workers concerned that Tata would give its own workers better conditions in the new company.""Yes, we do want to protect people. But we also want a company with better chances and less risks,"" Grolms said.Thyssenkrupp's management will present a refined strategy to its supervisory board in the second week of July.

2018-09-30,"After acquiring debt-laden Bhushan Steel through the insolvency and bankruptcy process, Tata Steel is now aiming to raise its production to 4 million tonne (MT) by the end of the current fiscal, an official said. Bhushan Steel's Odisha plant is presently operating at 3.5 MT against a capacity of 5 MT, the official said. ""The Bhushan plant in Odisha has a capacity of 5 MT but is currently operating at 3.5 MT.We are working to raise the production at least to a level of 4 MT a year by March 2019 as demand remains robust,"" the official, who is part of the new team installed by Tata Steel in the company, told PTI. The Bhushan Steel plant is located close to TataSteel's Kalinganagar facility where it has a 3 MT capacity.The official said the Kalinganagar plant expansion is on track despite Bhushan's takeover at Rs 36,000 crore. ""Safety and environment aspects need to be strengthened in Bhushan Steel as they are not up to our (TataSteel's) internal standards,"" he said. The new plant will follow Tata Steel's strategy of not just being a steel producer but a service company with extensive use of technology. Though Bhushan Steel will continue to be operated as a standalone outfit for the time being, a change of name is imminent to make it resemble a Tata company. The new management will be leveraging and complementing marketing strengths of Tata Steel, the official said. Tata Steel had earlier said there was a lot of synergies in taking over Bhushan Steel.
