2018-02-15,"A panel of MPs in Britain have criticised Tata Steel, the U.K. Government, the financial services and pensions regulator and others over a pensions mis-selling scandal that led to members of the British Steel Pension Scheme being “exploited for cynical personal gain.”The report relates to concerns around the financial advice provided to members of the pension scheme by pensions advisory firms. Last year an agreement was struck with U.K. pension authorities, following much negotiation and the payment of half-a-billion pounds and an equity stake, which will separate the £15-billion British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) from Tata Steel U.K., improving the company’s economic viability.Concerns began to swiftly mount late last year, over the advice given to members by pension advisory firms on whether to remain with the existing scheme (which will enter the Pension Protection Fund, the government scheme that covers members of pension scheme that falls into insolvency), or transfer to a new defined contribution scheme being set up by Tata Steel or transfer into a third party scheme.“Many BSPS members were shamelessly bamboozled into signing up to ongoing adviser fees and unsuitable funds characterised by high investment risk, high management charges and punitive exit fees,” said the report by the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee published on Thursday.It warned of another “major mis-selling scandal,” as it pointed to a catalogue of failures that “created perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage.” The report criticised the U.K. financial services regulator, the FCA, for the time it took to begin investigating the matter, but also reserved its criticism for the handling of the situation by Tata Steel.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:13:32 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/british-mps-criticise-tata-steel-uk-govt-over-pensions-mis-selling-scandal/article22765486.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

The German company did not say when the deal, which had been expected to close the end of 2018, would be concluded, indicating that it could now be delayed into 2019.Tata Steel’s proposed agreement with workers in the Netherlands has drawn opposition from Thyssenkrupp’s own powerful unions who fear that its German sites could be treated less favourable in the venture.“We will not accept worse conditions for the German sites,” said Detlef Wetzel, member of the works council of thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, which is to be merged with Tata Steel Europe.The deal marks a key step towards thyssenkrupp’s goal of becoming more focused on technology and industrial goods and cutting its reliance on the volatile steel sector, a shift welcomed by investors who are demanding further changes.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:13:38 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/thyssenkrupp-tata-steel-delay-signing-agreement-on-steel-joint-venture/article23529834.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-05-16,"Tata Steel Ltd. was helped to a quarterly profit of ₹146.88 billion rupees by a one-off pensions gain, in contrast with a ₹11.68 billion loss a year earlier.The Indian steelmaker on Wednesday reported an exceptional gain of ₹113.76 billion in the quarter ended March, including a non-cash gain of ₹140.77 billion relating to the restructuring of its British pension scheme.Britain’s pensions regulator agreed last year to allow Tata Steel U.K. to cut pension scheme liabilities, the main stumbling block in Tata’s efforts to merge its European operations with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp.In the same quarter last year, Tata Steel booked charges of ₹40.69 billion, including curtailment charges relating to the closure of Tata Steel Europe’s pension scheme.Income from operations in the quarter rose 2.6% to ₹357.37 billion, the company said in a statement. It also reported a decline of about 5.9% in total steel deliveries for the fourth quarter, while domestic deliveries slipped 5.6% to 3.03 million tonnes.“Tata Steel performance has been robust in FY18 driven by our strong execution strategy and supported by favourable global demand-supply balance,” T.V. Narendran, CEO and MD, said.“During the year, our Indian operations delivered volume growth better than the market on the back of the ramp-up at our Kalinganagar plant and the strength of our marketing network and brand equity.”Mr. Narendran said growth was broad-based across marketing segments and added Tata Steel Europe had a good quarter despite currency headwinds. “The 50:50 JV discussion with thyssenkrupp is progressing well,” he said.(With PTI inputs)Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:13:40 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tata-steel-q4-profit-lifted-by-one-off-uk-pension-gain/article23906047.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-06-27,"Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are nearing a 15 billion euro ($17.4 billion) deal this week to combine their European assets into a global steel giant, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.Talks to hammer out the final details are progressing well and a compromise has been reached on closing a valuation gap between the businesses, three of the people said.The combination of Thyssenkrupp’s and Tata Steel’s European steel assets, first announced in September, would create the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with 15 billion euros in combined sales. Sources told Reuters this month that the compromise options included a cash payment to Thyssenkrupp, changing the 50-50 ownership structure of the venture, lowering the debt to be transferred to it, or limiting dividend payments to Tata Steel for a number of years.“Talks are very constructive, they are on the final stretches,” one of the people said. Negotiations are ongoing and could still be delayed or collapse at the last moment, the people said, adding that both companies had a great interest in getting a deal done.Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel both declined to comment.The joint venture was originally planned to be signed in early 2018 but was delayed after Thyssenkrupp’s steel business performed much better than Tata Steel’s, requiring a reassessment of the deal.Signing is now planned by the end of June, but due to disagreement over the size of the valuation gap — with estimates ranging from 500 million to 3 billion euros — that timeline, too, has been called into question.While giving Thyssenkrupp boss Heinrich Hiesinger more leverage in negotiations, the gap has also enabled activist fund Elliott, who disclosed a stake in the steel-to-submarines group last month, to put more pressure on the CEO to deliver. German labour unions, which control half of the seats on Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, have expressed general support for the deal, saying last week they would be prepared to let talks run longer if it results in a better outcome.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:13:45 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/thyssenkrupp-nears-deal-with-tata-steel/article24273331.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-09-24,"Tata Steel’s decision to acquire Usha Martin’s one million-tonne steel business for a cash consideration of up to ₹4,700 crore would lift the company’s volume of long products by 24% and expand its product mix, analysts say.Usha Martin’s alloy long steel products cater to higher value-added automotive and engineering segments.Tata Steel, with an existing capacity of 29.5 million tonne has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Usha Martin’s speciality steel business through a slump sale on a going concern basis.“Deal valuation appears reasonable. Net debt to EBITDA could rise slightly to 3.6x. Impact on valuation would not be meaningful, in our view,” wrote Jefferies analyst Bhaskar Basu in a research note.Along with the steel unit, comes captive mines for iron ore with 2.5 million tonnes output in FY18, a thermal coal mine, which is under development and downstream assets like wire rod and bar rolling mills.Usha Martin was operating the plant at 60% capacity but Tata Steel can ramp up the production to 80% by de-bottlenecking, according to Jefferies, which has hold ratings on the stock.J.P. Morgan is overweight on Tata Steel as it believes that Usha Martin’s acquisition is done at attractive valuations and removes the overhang of Bhushan Power and Steel acquisition.Analysts are also upbeat about the deal for operational and logistical synergies. “It’s a positive for Tata given that they have a good ready-made steel asset at reasonable valuations with captive iron ore and coal mines.The acquisition will have operational and logistics synergies as Usha Martin assets are located in Jamshedpur, near Tata Steel’s unit. The steel cycle has turned around so it’s a timely acquisition,” Paras Bothra, president, equities, Aashika Stock Broking told The Hindu.HSBC Securities believes that Usha Martin deal is marginally positive as it will increase Tata Steel’s long product capacity to 4 million tonnes per annum.It has put Tata Steel as the preferred stock in the ferrous space.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:13:52 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tata-steel-product-mix-set-to-expand/article25030853.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

Indications were that till then, they would be sold under their present brand identities.Mr. Sen was speaking to the media after announcing TSL’s plans to jointly host the 56th National Metallurgists Day with the Indian Institute of Metals.He said that through these new capacities and its own expansion programmes at its existing plants, TSL was “aspiring” a capacity of 30 million tonnes by 2025. Including Bhusan Steel, TSL’s capacity is now about 18.5 million tonnes. The steel major had recently taken over Bhushan Steel, which has a capacity of 5.6 million tonnes and is in the process of taking over Usha Martin’s steel business, which has a 1.5-million- tonne capacity.Peeyush Gupta, TSL vice-president — steel marketing and sales, said that more than 20 products, solutions and services now contributed about 47% of TSL’s revenues.

2018-11-09,"Viswanathan Anand and Nihal Sarin, the oldest and youngest players in the fray, proved their worth in contrasting ways. P. Hari Krishna gave a packed hall much to cheer about. All this while, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov showed why the chess world considers him as one of the most pro-active campaigners in the shorter format on the opening day of the Tata Steel rapid chess tournament here on Friday.Of the 15 games played, only four proved decisive. Mamedyarov faced Indians in all three games that provided outright results. When the dust settled, Hari, Mamedyarov and Levon Aronian (two points each) were ahead of the rest. Importantly, Hari tamed Mamedyarov.For the gallant Azerbaijani, the defeat was sandwiched between victories over Vidit Gujrati and Surya Shekhar Ganguly.Hari, looking better against Mamedyarov, gained decisively after the fourth seed chose to capture a queenside pawn with his knight. With Hari’s queen and rook occupying menacing squares over the next four moves, Mamedyarov gave up.It was hard to recall when Anand last played out 145 moves for a draw! He was not sure whether he missed a win against Wesley So but candidly admitted being “relieved” after the American overlooked a move that could have made the decisive difference.“My first game was most interesting. I think there are days when I have not played 145 moves. So, to do it in one game was nice. And I was clearly lost at one point. I was relieved when he did not find that,” was how the World rapid champion chose to put it.In any case, Anand, 48, showed that the marathon had not impacted his energies and drew with Sergey Karjakin and Aronian. As a result, he stayed unbeaten against three higher-rated rivals and looked good to strike big over the weekend.Sarin, 14, playing in this elite company for the first time, drew with white pieces against Sergey Karjakin in 41 moves and again with Vidit Gujrati in 29 moves. In between, playing black against Aronian, he tried to play for a draw in an equal position and lost.The results: Third round: Viswanathan Anand (1.5) drew with Levon Aronian (Arm, 2); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 2) bt Surya Shekhar Ganguly (1); Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 1.5) drew with P. Hari Krishna (2); Nihal Sarin (1) drew with Vidit Gujarati (1); Wesley So (USA, 1.5) drew with Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 1.5).Second round: Hari bt Mamedyarov; Ganguly drew with So; Karjakin drew with Anand; Aronian bt Sarin; Vidit drew with Nakamura.First round: Sarin drew with Karjakin; Anand drew with So; Hari drew with Ganguly; Mamedyarov bt Vidit; Nakamura drew with Aronian.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:14:02 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tata-steel-chess-championship-hari-mamedyarov-aronian-lead/article25456691.ece© The HinduThe Indian duo will strive to make the quarterfinals at the Yokohama eventSaina said she had also taken up the issue with the global governing body but to no avail.Already a user?

2018-11-10,"Things couldn’t have gone any better for the all-conquering Hikaru Nakamura on a day when an adventurous Levon Aronian flirted with danger but escaped unscathed. Taking contrasting routes, the duo moved to the top at 4.5 points after six rounds of rapid games in the $40,000 Tata Steel chess tournament here.Saturday provided very little cheer for India. Vidit Gujrati provided the lone high spot when he overpowered Sergey Karjakin in the sixth round with clinical precision. Beaten by Wesley So in the previous round, Vidit gave nothing away and won in style.P. Hari Krishna (3.5 points) and Viswanathan Anand (3) drew all their games, including the one where they faced off in the fifth round, to hold the third and joint-fourth positions, respectively. Anand, who seemed better off against joint overnight leader Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, remained the only player with all draws so far.Five times World Champion Viswanathan Anand and Grandmaster Vidit Gujrathi during the Tata Steel Chess Championship in Kolkata on November 10, 2018. | Photo Credit: PTINihal Sarin, 14, reinforced his growing respect among the elite by holding Hari and Mamedyarov before losing to Nakamura in a match that featured highest and the lowest rated players of the competition.However, home favourite Surya Shekhar Ganguly lost all three games as his streak of successive defeats stretched to four. At the other end of spectrum was Nakamura who on all three games.The top seeded American benefited from Mamedyarov’s reluctance to accept draw and eventually prevailed. He then added to the woes of Ganguly before prevailing over Sarin, rated over 700 rating points below. Not many are aware that Sarin upstaged Nakamura in their online clash in the blitz format last year.“Today, I got absolutely nothing out of the opening against Sarin. In an equal position, he could not hold the position for long. As you get stronger, you learn to maintain the position against higher rated players. This comes with experience,” said Nakamura, a known admirer of the youngster.Aronian, too, had an eventful day. He started the day by scoring over Wesley So in 42 moves. In fact, on the 27th move, he could have trapped So’s queen with a rook-move but overlooked it.In the next round, Aronian and Sergey Karjakin blitzed the first 24 moves in added increment time before sanity returned to the proceedings in this Ruy Lopez Berlin game and ended in a 64-move draw.“Actually, I had played the same line against Anish Giri and got into trouble. Today, I made some better moves and still got into trouble,” revealed Aronian and continued, “I need to think about this line before I come back tomorrow.”He then lured Surya Shekhar Ganguly to his doom in their Guico Piano game. “I tried to create some imbalance in the position just to press Surya on the clock. I think. I managed to get him excited. At the very last moment, he could still make a draw, but I think he thought it’s a good moment to have his first win and he lost his way.”Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 4.5) bt Nihal Sarin (2); Surya Shekhar Ganguly (1) lost to Levon Aronian (Arm, 4.5); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 3) drew with Viswanathan Anand (3); P. Hari Krishna (3.5) drew with Wesley So (USA, 3); Vidit Gujrati (2.5) bt Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 3); (fifth round): Anand drew with Hari; So bt Vidit; Nakamura bt Ganguly; Sarin drew with Mamedyarov; Karjakin drew with Aronian; (fourth round): Vidit drew with Anand; Hari drew with Sarin; Mamedyarov lost to Nakamura; Ganguly lost to Karjakin; Aronian bt So.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:14:04 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tata-steel-chess-all-conquering-nakamura-joins-adventurous-aronian-in-lead/article25464332.ece© The HinduThe Indian duo will strive to make the quarterfinals at the Yokohama eventSaina said she had also taken up the issue with the global governing body but to no avail.Already a user?

2018-11-12,"A day after a 35-year-old senior manager at the Faridabad office of Tata Steel Processing and Distribution Ltd. (TSPDL) was shot dead, a former employee of the company was arrested in connection with the case on November 10, the police said on Sunday.The police said the accused, identified as Vishwash Pandey, was planning to target three more employees of TSPDL. The victim has been identified as Arindam Pal.Vishwash hails from Uttar Pradesh. The court has remanded him in three-day police custody, the police said.Investigation so far has revealed that Vishwash bought the pistol and 25 cartridges from Uttar Pradesh for ₹90,000. He fired two shots in a park on Diwali to practise before committing the murder.The accused had got a job in a multinational company in Singapore and was scheduled to leave on Thursday, the police said.Vishwash told the police during interrogation that he held a grudge against the victim and three others as they had allegedly hatched a conspiracy to dismiss him from his job.He was sacked in August this year for indiscipline and misbehaviour, based on Pal’s report .Vishwash entered the office from the main gate on November 9 around 1 p.m. and left from the rear gate after the murder. The accused, being a former employee, made a friendly entry to the company’s premises and went straight to Pal’s cabin. He shot Pal five times after a brief altercation.Pal’s family alleged that the accused had sent him emails threatening to kill him. Over a month ago, the family claimed Pal had to leave his car in office and return home in a cab after he learnt that Vishwash was outside the office premises.Faridabad Police spokesperson Sube Singh said Pal’s family never told the police about the alleged threats. Mr. Singh added that the involvement of more people in the murder has not yet been ruled out.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:14:05 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1-held-for-senior-tata-steel-managers-murder/article25471088.ece© The HinduState unit kept out of Amit Shah-directed exerciseAlready a user?

2018-12-08,"Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and India’s Tata Steel are close to deciding who will lead their planned European steel joint venture, four people familiar with the matter said.Settling on the venture’s leadership has been delayed by a strategy crisis and the change of CEO at the German industrial conglomerate, which has said it would split into two companies.The hold-up has riled the Thyssenkrupp workforce. A labour leader said there would be “trouble” if the matter was not resolved soon.Andreas Goss, head of Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit, is the front runner to become chief executive of the combined entity, which will be Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, the people said.The new company will have around 48,000 workers and about €17 billion ($19.4 billion) in sales, with production facilities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.Mr. Goss, seen as well connected in the industry, has led Thyssenkrupp’s steel division since 2014.The unit’s adjusted operating profit rose by 26% to €687 million over the past financial year. His appointment would further strengthen Thyssenkrupp’s position in the 50:50 venture, which already includes a greater share of proceeds should the entity be listed on the stock exchange, which is widely expected.Signed in June, the planned entity still needs European anti-trust approval, which is expected towards the end of the first quarter of 2019.Hans Fischer, CEO of Tata Steel’s European subsidiary, is also likely to join the venture’s management board, the people said.Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel, in June, said the joint venture’s management board would consist of six members, shared equally between both groups. That number could be reduced to four to give a more focused structure to the entity, which will be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the people said.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:14:07 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/thyssenkrupp-tata-steel-near-decision-on-steel-jv-board/article25699010.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-12-17,"Andreas Goss will be the chief executive officer of Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel B.V., the proposed joint venture between Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp.Mr. Goss is currently the chief executive officer of Thyssenkrupp’s steel division.He would chair the management board of Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel B.V., according to a statement from Tata Steel. Hans Fischer, now the CEO of Tata Steel Europe, would be the deputy CEO and chief technology officer of the JV. Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp on Monday had decided on the members of the future management board for the JV to be headquartered in Amsterdam.Tata Steel and thyssenkrupp AG signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their European steel businesses in a 50:50 joint venture to be positioned as a leading pan-European high-quality flat steel producer with a strong focus on performance, quality and technology leadership.Sandip Biswas, currently the group executive vice-president, finance of Tata Steel Limited, is the designated chief financial officer, while Premal Desai, the current CFO of thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, will be the chief strategy officer of the joint venture.The joint venture is subject to merger control clearance in several jurisdictions, including in the European Union.T. V. Narendran, CEO and MD of Tata Steel, said: “I firmly believe that the designated management board has a strong combination of industry and leadership experience needed to ensure a successful and sustainable future for the proposed thyssenkrupp Tata Steel Joint Venture. This marks an important step forward in our preparations towards establishing the planned joint venture.”Guido Kerkhoff, CEO of thyssenkrupp, said: “The future management board is the right choice to build a strong number two European flat steel supplier. I am fully convinced that this board will successfully lead the integration of the joint venture given their extensive technical and operational expertise as well as their broad inter-cultural experiences. They will optimally set-up the joint venture to address future challenges of the industry and meet the needs of the customers.”Both companies remain committed to constructive engagement with the European Commission as part of the ongoing regulatory review process. Both parties are working together to ensure the success of this transaction as soon as possible.Until the completion of the joint venture process, thyssenkrupp Steel Europe and Tata Steel in Europe will continue to operate as separate companies and as competitors and the incumbent organisation of the respective companies will continue to operate as currently. The members of the designated management board will continue in their existing roles within their businesses until the formation of the joint venture post all regulatory approvals, said the statement.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 4, 2019 9:14:08 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/goss-is-ceo-for-tata-steel-jv-in-europe/article25766272.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?
