2018-01-13,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel is set to launch a $1-billion bond issue as part of a mega financing exercise to streamline its international balance sheet before its European joint venture with Thyssenkrupp kicks off, said several people with knowledge of the matter. A formal announcement is expected on Saturday, they said. This will be among the largest fund-raising exercises that the group will be undertaking after N Chandrasekaran took over as Tata Sons chairman in February last year.Apart from the bonds, which will have a tenure of five, seven and 10 years, Tata Steel will also refinance $1.1-1.5 billion of loans housed in its Singapore subsidiaries, TS Global Holdings Pte. and NatSteel Asia Pte, for another six years, said the people. The loans were last refinanced in 2015 and are expected to carry a pricing of Libor+250 basis points or 4.5%. A basis point is 0.01percentage point.“Roadshows for the bonds begin on Monday. The management will meet investors in Dubai, London, Singapore and Hong Kong,” said a company executive on condition of anonymity. “The plan is to price them on January 18.”Over a dozen global banks have been mandated for the issue and are said to include BofA Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citi, StanChart, Barclays, HSBC, UBS and BNP Paribas.The bonds will be based on letters of comfort from Tata Steel India and not corporate guarantees, said the people cited above. Tata Steel didn’t respond to queries. “At the beginning of the year, many global investors are likely to come with fresh allocations for emerging markets. We are trying to tap that pool of money along with traditional ones,” said a person involved in the process.Since September, the US 10-year Treasury yields — the global risk-free proxy — have surged about 55 basis points. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.This has led to an increase in other benchmark rates used to price loans. Sixmonth Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, rose about 60 basis points to 1.87% in the same period. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in September reached a preliminary agreement to merge their European steel units to create the continent’s secondlargest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, with 15 billion euros (about Rs 1.14 lakh crore) of sales.They said the deal will help them tackle overcapacity in Europe’s steel market, which faces cheap imports, subdued construction demand and inefficient legacy plants. The companies have already announced 4,000 job cuts as part of the tieup. Tata Steel is expected to transfer 2.4 billion euros of debt from its troubled European business to the balance sheet of the joint venture, while Thyssenkrupp will transfer 4 billion euros of debt. About 450 million euros of debt from the European operations will remain, which the Tata group plans to pay out. “Now that the JV will address the lion’s share of its European debt, the focus has shifted to the debt at the Singapore entity,” said an investment banker. “Once the bond issuance is through, chances are that the total refinancing will be upsized to $2.5 billion.”Moody’s in November changed its ratings outlook on Tata Steel and Tata Steel UK Holdings (TSUKH) to stable from negative. “The change reflects our expectation that the benign operating environment and recovery in the financial performance of TSUKH and Tata Steel over the last few quarters will continue over a longer term, leading to a sustained improvement in its credit metrics,” said Kaustubh Chaubal, Moody's vice president and senior analyst.Tata Steel's consolidated adjusted leverage--as indicated by adjusted debt/reported EBITDA--stood at an estimated 4.7x at end-September 2017, down from 8.9x in March 2016.As of September 30, Tata Steel’s gross debt stood at Rs 90,259 crore. Strong growth prospects, particularly in the key operating markets of India, Europe and Southeast Asia, amid capacity removals in China, augur well for Tata Steel, analysts said.RIGHTS ISSUE The company is also planning a $2 billion rights issue to fund India expansion. At its December 19 board meeting, Tata Steel approved an expansion of 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) at its Kalinganagar plant, which currently has a capacity of 13 mtpa.The proposed expansion will cost the company Rs 23,500 crore, which will be funded through a mix of debt and equity. The expansion is expected to meet the requirements of automotive, general engineering and other value-added segments, the company said in its stock exchange filings.“Some industry observers may argue that with the Europe JV likely to be completed next year and a strong outlook for the steel industry, the net debt profile and leverage should be manageable and hence, why dilute equity?” said Pinakin Parekh, analyst at JP Morgan.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-begins-to-recast-up-to-2-5-billion-of-global-debt/articleshow/62482043.cms
2018-01-15,"A young Sajjan Jindal would attend the AGMs of Tata Steel, Birla Group and Reliance Industries to observe the industry leaders at work.  Today, the role of a good mentor in business is more important than ever, and most HNIs and industrialists are willing to share their knowledge with budding entrepreneurs. Some have even created platforms to exchange such ideas. The scene, however, was very different in the mid-1980s, as JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal recalls.  As a young entrepreneur, tasked with the job of turning a sick steel unit into a profitable one and creating a legacy of his own, Jindal didn’t have the “good fortune” of having access to such platforms. So, what did he do? He attended AGMs of other companies like Tata Steel, Reliance Industries and Birla Group.  From the AGMs, Jindal says, he gained insight into how the business leaders of the day tackled stressful situations.  “I would sit in a corner [at the Tata Steel AGMs] and look at the chairman [JRD Tata]. Even Dhirubhai Ambani. Every year, as a ritual, I would sit in the meetings and just observe them. What their reaction was,” says Jindal.  The way each industry leader handled shareholder queries or complaints also gave a peek into their personality. “For instance, Dhirubhai Ambani would react to the shareholders. If someone complained, he would respond very passionately. Aditya Birla would reply calmly, while JRD Tata would just make copious notes till the end of the AGM. Then he would say, ‘My CFO or company secretary will take care of all your questions’. So, as a young person, I learnt a lot from these stalwarts of Indian industry,” Jindal says.  Hero worship It’s no secret that Jindal is an admirer of Jamsetji Tata. When building his own steel factory, his benchmark was Tata Steel. “Jamsetji Tata built the steel plant when there were no drones or satellites to tell you about the location of minerals. Still, he could find the best location in the world to build Tata Steel,” Jindal says. “Jamshedpur is close to the iron ore and coking coal. There cannot be a better site in the world to build a steel plant. I often wonder how he managed to find such an amazing site way back in 1890-95. That’s why he was a real hero for me.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/master-class-sajjan-jindal-learnt-business-skills-by-attending-agms-of-tata-steel-reliance-industries/articleshow/62503130.cms

The two new brands were unveiled by Anand Sen, President TQM & Steel Business, Tata Steel, at the IBMD’s (Industrial By-Products Management Division) Customer Meet held in Kolkata on Tuesday.The IBMD division caters to a wide range of Industrial By-Products produced by Tata Steel that serve as key raw materials for various industries.

The launch of the two new brands Tata Aggreto (branded LD Slag for usage as road aggregates) and Tata Nirman (branded LD Slag for use in fly ash brick and clinker making) is part of that journey, an official statement said.Speaking on the launch of the brands, T V Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel, said: “We at Tata Steel are extremely happy to have launched Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman, which are designed to create value for customers, end users and Tata Steel.” He added that, “Tata Steel has always believed in sustainable growth and we are on a journey to reduce the carbon footprint. The launch of Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman will help us progress further in this journey.” Tata Aggreto is produced out of 0-65 mm processed LD slag with four different size ranges for convenience in design mix.

2018-01-23,"KOLKATA: Tata Steel is keen on pursuing every opportunity to acquire stressed steel assets that can help it expand capacity in the domestic market, the company’s managing director has said. This comes at a critical time as several debt-ridden steel companies like Essar Steel, Electrosteel Steels, and Bhushan Steel are undergoing bankruptcy proceedings under the dedicated insolvency court –– the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal).“Such inorganic opportunities come once in a while and we need to pursue them. It is a great opportunity for anyone in the steel industry that has the appetite and ambition to grow in India and steel industry is one of the pioneers in India,” TV Narendran, MD, Tata Steel, said.“We have announced our plans to raise capacity in India. We see great opportunity to grow in India. We are well positioned because we have organic and inorganic opportunities to grow,” Narendran said. He was speaking on the sidelines of the Tata Literary Meet which opened in the city on Monday.“Kalinganager has shaped up well. It is in full production and it is the right time to start work on the second phase which has already been approved by the board,” he added. The company is raising ₹12,800 crore through a mega rights issue that will go into creating additional steel capacity of 5 million tonne in Odisha.Narendran’s comments come close on the heels of Tata Steel announcing a mega bond issue of $1.38 billion last Friday that the company said will help refinance part of its debt in Europe and pave the way for its possible merger of its steel business in Europe with Thyssenkrupp of Germany.Commenting on the Budget expectations, Narendran said the steel industry and Tata Steel would benefit if the government invests more in infrastructure.“You cannot build infrastructure without steel. It forms the biggest component of the steel policy. Secondly, better infra reduces cost of production since logistics remains abig issue in India and drags down production cost. We are also seeing demand coming from construction and rural sectors,” he said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-keen-to-buy-stressed-assets-md-tv-narendran/articleshow/62612350.cms
2018-01-26,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel has sought an opportunity to bid afresh for bankrupt Electrosteel Steels on the ground that clarity had emerged regarding taxes to be paid on acquiring a stressed asset subsequent to the deadline for submissions having passed, said two persons with knowledge of the development.ET reported on January 9 that Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources had submitted the highest bid pegged at about Rs 4,500 crore compared with the Tata Group’s Rs 3,500-crore offer.The latest move by Tata, suggesting it could raise its bid, followed a clarification issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on January 5, a day after the deadline for Electrosteel bids.Lenders are debating whether a new round of bids can be called, said the people cited above.“The amount of total loss brought forward (including unabsorbed depreciation) shall be allowed to be reduced from the book profit for the purposes of levy of MAT (minimum alternate tax) under Section 115JB of the Act,” CBDT had said.This alters calculations, Tata told the resolution professional (RP) Dhaivat Anjaria, said the people cited above, who have seen the letter.No PrecedentTata indicated it will be in a position to improve upon its earlier offer but didn’t provide any further details, they said.“In a letter to the resolution professional, TV Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel, had requested that rebidding be done for Electrosteel Steels because of new developments, which changes the matrix of the pricing of the distressed company,” said one of the persons.A Tata Steel spokesperson told ET in an email: “We are abiding by the process as laid out by the resolution professional and we don’t want to comment on the process or any specific issues raised by you at this stage.”Anjaria did not respond to queries. He had set a deadline of January 4 for binding bids for Electrosteel.The letter has been passed on to the committee of creditors, which met on Tuesday to discuss whether there was a case for fresh bids being called.Given that there is no precedent, “the lenders will have to apply their mind on the matter,” said a bank official who attended the meeting but did not want to be named. “As a bank, I am interested in getting most of my money back in the shortest possible time and with the least amount of haircut.”Electrosteel Steels has dues of about Rs 13,600 crore. It has a planned steelmaking capacity of 2.5 million tonnes and a commissioned capacity of 1.5 million tonnes.The clarification should help successful buyers save on MAT. “According to the industry players, the revised rules on MAT are a game changer, paving the way for improving the offer price,” said one of the persons cited above.Tata Steel is among four contenders for Electrosteel Steels. Apart from Vedanta, the other bidders were Renaissance Group and a fund backed by Edelweiss Group, ET had reported earlier. The offers made by Renaissance and Edelweiss could not be verified.Electrosteel Steels is one of the 12 companies that the Reserve Bank of India directed banks in June 2017 to refer to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Of these 12 companies, apart from Electrosteel Steels, binding bids have been submitted for Monnet Ispat and Jyoti Structures.

2018-01-30,"LONDON: A majority of the 122,000 workers affected by the closure of a crisis-hit 15-billion-pound pension scheme have signed up to a deal to switch to a new pension plan backed by Tata Steel UK.It was confirmed that around 97,000 members returned their option forms to indicate if they agreed to move their retirement funds from the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) into the new plan, with just 14 per cent choosing to remain with the old scheme.""As part of one of the largest pension consultations conducted in the UK, option packs were issued to the Scheme's membership of around 122,000. Just under 97,000 members completed and returned option forms, of which 86 per cent were from members choosing to switch to the New BSPS,"" a BSPS statement said.An estimated 25,000 members who did not respond in time will stay on in the present scheme to start automatically moving with it into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) at the end of March as part of a deal struck between the Indian steel giant and the UK's Pensions Regulator last year.Allan Johnston, chairman of the BSPS trustees, said: ""I am pleased so many scheme members took the time to choose the outcome that was best for them based on their personal circumstances"".""The New BSPS offers benefits that for most members are the same or better than the PPF and around 83,000 members have chosen to switch to the New Scheme,"" the statement said.Tata Steel UK also welcomed the outcome of the consultation exercise as a ""positive choice"" by a majority of the workers.""Although much work is still needed to deliver a secure future in our UK business, the progress with pensions is welcome,"" a company spokesperson said.""We are also pleased to note the trustee expects the new scheme to pass the agreed qualifying conditions to go forward,"" he noted.Steel workers had welcomed the agreement struck in September 2017, with unions committing to persuading their members to sign up to the new scheme. They have now expressed concerns that a failure to respond in time could hit some of the workers hard.""Community warned the government that thousands of BSPS members would default into the PPF against their interests simply because they failed to return a form,"" said Alasdair McDiarmid, Operations Director at the steelworkers' union Community.His group had called for action to be taken to ensure those who did not respond to the consultation would automatically join the new BSPS2 as they would be better off in the new scheme.""This scandalous inaction means that thousands of steelworkers will now be worse off in retirement,"" he said.An agreement to detach the BSPS from Tata Steel's UK business involved the Indian company offering to pay 550 million pounds into the now-closed BSPS and give the fund, which is set to transfers to the PPF, a 33 per cent stake in its UK business.The so-called Regulated Apportionment Arrangement (RAA) signed by Tata Steel with the trustee of the BSPS was seen as crucial to clear the path for the UK arm of the Indian steel major's merger with German giant ThyssenKrupp.""The RAA is one important milestone in Tata Steel UK's journey towards a sustainable and enduring future, with pension obligations, whose risk profile would be consistent with the underlying business,"" Koushik Chatterjee, Tata Steel's group executive director, said last year.The BSPS had been the main barrier to any future plans for Tata Steel in the UK, which still owns the Port Talbot unit in south Wales - Britain's largest steelworks.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/majority-of-uk-workers-join-new-pension-plan-backed-by-tata-steel/articleshow/62714252.cms

2018-02-05,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel, Tata Steel and a group of employees along with a private equity firm have submitted bids for the bankrupt Bhushan Steel, said four people familiar with the matter. The resolution professional received the bids on Saturday and these will be opened for examination by Tuesday, they said.“We have received bids, now the RP will assess them and present it to the committee of creditors but if there are any promoter association with any of the bids, that will be rejected,” said one of the persons. Consultancy firm Deloitte is running the process.Bhushan Steel, which involves a Rs 44,000 crore default, is the biggest bankruptcy to go under the hammer thus far after the Reserve Bank of India and the government pushed banks to clean up the bad loan mess through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).As many as 451 cases with an exposure of Rs 1.28 lakh crore are pending in the bankruptcy courts. Essar Steel and Electrosteel Steels are the other big metal companies undergoing the bankruptcy process. Bidding for Bhushan has witnessed some twists in the past month with many global giants showing initial interest then withdrawing from the race.JSW Steel had submitted its bid along with Piramal Enterprises’ distressed asset fund after Japanese company JFE Steel Corp bowed out at the last moment. Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources was also said to be interested in the company but also stayed away from a binding bid.ArcelorMittal, which was said to have been interested, said it had not bid. “ArcelorMittal can confirm it has not bid for Bhushan Steel, but we remain interested at looking at future opportunities in India,” a company spokesperson said. Bhushan Steel has an annual steel capacity of 5 million tonnes.The resolution professional has set the liquidation value at Rs 15,000 crore, below which no bid will be accepted. Most bids are expected to be in the Rs 25,000-30,000 crore range.For JSW, Bhushan Steel will provide a gateway to the east and north, as most of its existing facilities are concentrated in the east. For Tata Steel, which is predominantly in the east, acquiring the company makes sense as its grip on the eastern region will continue.Neeraj Singhal, promoter and vice chairman of Bhushan Steel, is said to have written to lenders asking them to consider restructuring the Rs 44,000 crore debt under the Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) mechanism. The letter, written on January 29, said the company was wrongly taken to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) as its restructuring proposal had been in the final lap.The promoters own 57.82% of the company.

2018-02-07,"MUMBAI: Renaissance Steel, one of the four bidders for the bankrupt Electrosteel Steels, has questioned whether Tata Steel and Anil Agarwal-run Vedanta are eligible to bid under the bankruptcy process for alleged breaches of the law by their subsidiaries, said two people familiar with the matter. In a letter submitted to the Committee of Creditors for Electrosteel Steels, Renaissance has also asked whether allowing Vedanta and Tata Steel to bid would amount to a violation of existing laws. Sources told ET that Renaissance has said the two companies may be ineligible under Section 29A (d) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which prohibits bidding by entities that have been found guilty and handed out sentencing under criminal laws.As per the rule, companies will not be eligible to submit bids if any of their subsidiaries have been convicted for an offence punishable for more than two years. Renaissance Steel has claimed that subsidiaries of both Tata Steel and Vedanta have been convicted in the UK and Zambia, respectively, and hence they should be disqualified.Tata Steel and Vedanta did not comment. “One of the resolution applicants in Electrosteel has already raised formal objections regarding the eligibility of Tata Steel and Vedanta and we are looking into the matter. The resolution professional is seeking legal opinion,” said one of the people aware of the matter. “We have also asked the resolution professional to seek an explanation from the bidders and examine the matter.”Section 29A(d) of the IBC says that a person shall not be eligible to submit a resolution plan, if such a person or any other person acting jointly or in concert with such a person has been convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more.According to the representation made by Renaissance, a crane at UK’s Scunthorpe Steelworks, then run by a subsidiary company of Tata Steel, crushed a maintenance electrician. The allegation was that Tata Steel UK did not have sufficient safety procedure in place.According to the letter, Tata UK has been facing prosecution in ‘Hull Crown Court’ for breaching statutory provisions of Health and Safety at Work Act, 1974. “The punishment that may be awarded to Tata UK for the offence committed is… unlimited fine or imprisonment not exceeding two years or both,” says the letter reviewed by ET.In the case of Vedanta Resources, its subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) faced prosecution by the government of Zambia for pollution and harm caused to the environment in November 2010. As per the ineligibility note with lenders, KCM was convicted for breaching the statutory provisions of the Environmental Protection and Control of Pollution Act 1990.The letter states that under the act, the offender is liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding sixty thousand penalty units, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both.“This has significant implications on the whole resolution process. We are trying to find out whether these claims will hold true under the IBC. We received the submission only on Thursday last week. So it is too early to determine whether Tata and Vedanta would have to be disqualified because of the clause,” said another executive involved with the bidding.Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group had emerged as the highest bidder for Electrosteel Steels by quoting Rs 4,500 crore, while Tata Steel’s bid was worth Rs 3,500 crore, ET reported earlier.Renaissance Group and Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company had also submitted bids for a resolution plan.Electrosteel Steels owes more than Rs 13,000 crore to lenders and Rs 191.6 crore to operational creditors.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/deals/tata-steel-vedantas-eligibility-questioned-for-electrosteel-bid/articleshow/62926182.cms

Turnover went up 15% to Rs 33,446 crore, against Rs 29,024 crore in the previous corresponding period. Consolidated quarterly Ebidta at Rs 5,801 crore registered a 59% increase year on year (y-o-y) with an Ebidta margin of 17%. Consolidated profit below tax at Rs 3,210 crore increased from Rs 1,000 crore in the same period, previous fiscal. However, exceptional charges of Rs 1,116 crore arising mainly from regulatory claims relating to mining operations reduced profitability.The company’s gross debt stood at Rs 88,601crore, down by Rs 1,658 crore, mainly due to repayments and a positive impact on the forex front. Consolidated quarterly deliveries of 6.56 million tonne (mt) saw an 8% increase. India deliveries now constitute almost 50% of the group deliveries, an official statement added.On a standalone basis, Tata Steel deliveries went up by 10% to 3.3 million tonne, against 2.99 mt in the year-ago period, while net profit was at Rs 1,338 crore, compared with Rs 1,205 crore. Standalone turnover was Rs 15,596 crore, up 22% from Rs 14,106 crore due to higher deliveries, better realisations. DOMESTIC GROWTHIn India, the company reported broadbased steel sales, showing a 34% rise y-o-y and a 22% y-o-y growth in highend automotive steel sales. Branded products, retail solutions sales rose 7% and the engineering sub-segment saw double the growth from last fiscal.TV Narendran, chief executive, Tata Steel, said, “In India, we have witnessed strong volumes growth across verticals as well as an increase in realisations. Our European operations performance was marginally lower due to seasonal pressures as well as planned maintenance and upgrades designed to strengthen operations and our long-term capability.”Sharing his near-term outlook, Narendran said, “Globally, steel prices have been buoyant with improved trade position in China along with cost push from raw materials. Over the past nine months, we delivered strong consolidated operational performance across geographies. We expect this momentum to continue as markets are expected to remain favorable.”The company’s board has approved expansion in capacity of its new steel plant at Kalinganagar in Odisha to 5 mt at an investment of Rs 23,000 crore. Narendran said, “Our focus on India continues as we look to expand our Kalinganagar site as well as pursue inorganic growth opportunities.”Koushik Chatterjee, chief financial officer, Tata Steel, said, “Tata Steel group revenues witnessed robust growth driven by improved volumes in India and stronger realisations across geographies, on the back of the improvement in commodity prices and an expansion in spreads globally.”The scrip closed at Rs 683.65 on the BSE on Friday, up 1.83% over previous close.In Europe, steel deliveries were up 4% on-year to 2.44 mt in the quarter under review. “We are progressing well on the JV with Thyssenkrupp and are committed to building a longterm investment in strong European portfolio,” Narendran said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-steel-posts-5-fold-yoy-jump-in-q3-profit-at-rs-1136-crore-still-misses-street-estimates/articleshow/62850603.cms

2018-02-13,"ET Intelligence Group : Tata Steel’s stock has remained range bound in the past three months after gaining over 48 per cent in the previous six months. It may come back on investors’ radar given its better-than-expected performance in the December 2017 quarter, reduced debt and initiatives to streamline the UK business.Despite subdued performance in Europe, the steel producer reported the highest profitability in the December quarter since FY15, which was 10 per cent more than the consensus estimate. Domestic business reported 26 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 24 per cent year-on-year growth in operating profit before depreciation (EBIDTA) per tonne. This offset the weak Europe performance – EBITDA per tonne fell by 1 per cent year-on-year and 11 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Sales increased by 20 per cent to Rs 33,500 crore yearon-year led by 7 per cent higher volume and 12 per cent increase in realisation.The company’s performance is likely to sustain considering the pick-up in demand in the past two months due to rising spend on infrastructure. This will enable steel companies to pass on the higher iron ore and coking coal prices. Tata Steel with 100 per cent captive iron ore will benefit the most from this.Tata Steel’s net debt reduced to Rs 76,000 crore from Rs 78,000 crore a quarter ago. The company plans to raise over Rs 13,000 crore through rights issue, which along with improving cash flows will lower its net debt-to-equity ratio to 1.3-1,4 by the end of next fiscal from 2 in FY17.Improving debt situation will allow the company to add timely capacities — the board has approved another 5 million tonne capacity expansion to be executed over the next four years. This will take the company’s total capacity to 18 million tonnes.The company’s stock rose by 4.2 per cent to Rs 712.5 on Monday. Its enterprise value was seven times FY18 expected EBITDA. Given the bright prospects, the valuation is likely to expand in the medium term.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/good-q3-show-may-draw-investors-to-tata-steel/articleshow/62898290.cms
2018-02-19,"Analysts have been upgrading Tata Steel since it declared its third quarter numbers for 2017-18. The company’s domestic performance was well above the Street expectations: Tata Steel reported its highest ever domestic EBITDA in the third quarter. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Due to increased domestic demand—domestic steel consumption is now at a 15-month high—and better realisations, domestic sales and EBITDA for the quarter increased 23% and 38% respectively. Analysts’ viewsBuy: 24Sell: 1Hold: 4Increase in prices of flat steel products—hot rolled coils, tin-plates, coated steel products, etc.—in November and December helped Tata Steel improve domestic realisations. As prices of long products—wires, rods, rails, bars, etc.—have also risen since January, Tata steel is expected to report better numbers in the fourth quarter as well. Due to reduced dumping from China, quarterly sales in Europe and South East Asia have risen 21% and 23% respectively. South East Asia operations have reported 45% EBITDA growth. Tata Steel’s European operations, however, saw 11% fall in EBITDA due to increased maintenance costs. Due to higher volumes and margins and stabilising maintenance costs, European operations are expected to report good numbers in the fourth quarter. Tata Steel’s efforts to improve performance from other geographies have also started yielding results. Though quarterly sales from these regions fell to Rs 666 crore from Rs 2,238 crore year on year, it saw a positive EBITDA of Rs 338 crore compared to negative EBITDA of Rs 566 crore a year ago. Global steel prices have also been improving in the last two years because of increased demand due to economic recovery. Reduced dumping from China is also helping other steel companies. Chinese steel production has been falling due to plant shut downs for maintenance activities and due the steps taken by the Chinese government to curb pollution. However, some part of the Chinese production (shut for maintenance) is expected to resume after March 2018. Despite the recent rally and jump in its valuations, analysts are getting bullish on Tata Steel because of its improving prospects. Due to its raw material security and higher revenue share from value-added products, Tata Steel is the best domestic player to benefit from this steel cycle upturn. Any initiative to divest its European operations can be a trigger for the counter.Selection MethodologyWe pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in ‘consensus analyst rating’ in the past one month.

Tata and JSW were the only two bidders for the company ET reported on 9 February.Tata Steel’s offer includes an upfront payment to lenders of Rs. 17,000 crores, a cash infusion in the company of Rs. 7000 crores to meet working capital requirements and a payout to operational creditors as well as employees.Tata Steel may be asked to sweeten its deal further, after which lenders would put its offer to a vote before submitting it to the National Company Law Tribunal for approval.There was consensus amongst a majority of lenders that Tata Steel’s offer and accompanying resolution plan was in the best interest of all stakeholders, a banker privy to the process said. The offer would help lenders maximize recovery of their dues.Bhushan Power and Steel was admitted to bankruptcy court in June last year. Mahender Khandelwal, head of restructuring services at BDO is the resolution professional for the company.A Tata Steel spokesperson told ET on 18 January in response to queries pertaining to its interest in acquiring Bhushan Power and Steel, ""As a process, we do assess and evaluate various strategic opportunities for growth. This is an ongoing process in the company"". The company was yet to respond to emailed queries sent on Saturday.Alvarez & Marsal are the financial advisors to Tata Steel.

An acquisition of both Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel could give the company an almost 50% share of the market for flat-steel products in India, according to a senior executive at a rival steel-maker. Flat-steel products are used in manufacturing of automobiles and consumer appliances among various other uses.The auction for Bhushan Power and Steel received interest from as many as 12 bidders initially, including ArcelorMittal, Vedanta, AION Capital and Dubai-based businessman Shaikh Ayub. Tata and JSW were the only two bidders that it made it to the final stages of bidding.UK-based Liberty House expressed its interest to make a bid for the company post the deadline for submission of final offers.

2018-02-20,"Talking to ET Now, SK Roongta, Former Chairman, SAIL & Industry Expert, says we are close to the top-end of the steel pricing cycle but suddenly the prices are not going to drop.Edited excerpts:Is Tata Steel trying to be aggressive in buying the five million-ton capacity Bhushan Steel or do you think in this kind of a market, that aggression is warranted?The exact details of the bid are not in public domain officially but one has to view this bid in the context of a few factors. One, in the foreseeable future, we do not expect any new green-field steel capacity to come up in India. Second, Bhushan Steel has got value-added plants at Ghaziabad as well as Khopoli which were already generating profits and they are very active in auto sector as well as other value-added products. Third, the commodity cycle, especially for steel has undergone a change, especially with regard to developments in China, especially in 2017 and I do not think we are going to see the repeat of what happened in 2015-16 where China was so aggressive in exports both in terms of volume as well as price. Four, Tata Steel would have factored in the synergies in terms of raw material linkage from their mines as well as other synergies in terms of logistics, procurement as well as marketing. On the face of it, the bid has to be viewed in the context of all these factors.Consolidation usually comes by when commodity cycle is at its peak. Would you say that we are at that top end already for this commodity cycle or not quite?In the shorter term, further consolidation or price improvement is expected in steel but the prices are already ruling at pretty high levels. We cannot expect prices to go on improving further. In a way, we can say we are close to the top-end of the cycle but that suddenly we are not going to drop. A great thing happened in 2015-16 and a few factors which we have to account for is that in India although growth for steel consumption has been moderate in the last two years, going forward we can expect a robust growth, especially once the investment and construction sectors show some visible signs of pickup.If that happens then, intensity to GDP growth can come to close to one. That means if we grow at about 8%, we can expect 8-9% of steel consumption growth and that will augur very well for the Indian steel industry because we have about 12.5% of protection in terms of import tariff apart from anti-dumping duties of course those are not to be operated at today’s price levels but nevertheless 12.5% is a good protection.The Indian Steel sector is benefiting because of this artificial barrier which has got created and somewhere everyone will take notice of the fact that if the local steel prices are going higher, you cannot make a case for an anti-dumping duty. The idea of anti-dumping duty is to protect the local industry because of external dumping. Now that local prices have gone higher, I am sure there would be pressure from WTO and other agencies to bring this entire entry barrier down?Yes, in fact, the anti-dumping duties are already ineffective because the effective global prices are higher than the anti-dumping levels and at some stage, if the steel prices remain robust, then there will be a case for removing anti-dumping duties. I am not really making a case for anti-dumping duties but global prices are ruling high and Indian steel industry are export competitive also. Today, the domestic prices of steel are not higher than the landed cost of imports which traditionally they have been having some 5-7% advantage as compared to landed price of imports so if the steel prices are moving up that is a global phenomenon.On the China point, there was a time when China had significant financial advantage of easy credit terms being given by government to their companies. Would you say that scenario is behind us now?China decided to close down a capacity of about 150 million tons from 2016 to 2020 and as per the reports they are already ahead of that target. Already about 120 million tons of capacity has been closed. They have also been able to close on account of environmental factors. China has a stake in seeing the health of their steel industry survive and obviously I do not expect that past scenario will reappear and Chinese government, apart from investing in infrastructure which is keeping the Chinese steel demand robust contrary to earlier projections that Chinese steel demand will come down.Nevertheless, it is in the interest of China that their steel industry remains healthy because the owe a lot of money to their banking sector and if the situations lasts for the next two, three years, the steel industry will be much healthier. They would not need the support of the government or their banking sector.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/4-reasons-tata-steel-is-bidding-for-bhushan-steel-sk-roongta/articleshow/62995216.cms
2018-02-20,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel, India’s oldest producer of the alloy, plans to raise up to $800-900 million through overseas borrowings to replace expensive debt and to raise cash for buying stressed local mills, two people familiar with the matter told ET.The fresh round of fund raising comes amid a Rs 12,800-crore rights issue that closes the end of this month at the Tata group major.“Tata Steel officials are in advanced negotiations with at least half a dozen banks, though an official mandate is yet to be signed. However, the intent is to complete the capital raising exercise before March 31,” said one of the sources cited above.Tata Steel didn’t comment.A foreign bank loan is priced by adding a spread above the benchmark LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The whole sum is normally raised from a group of foreign lenders. Overseas loans are seen gaining traction, with many large companies opting for them.Tata Steel is seen as a major contender for buying stressed assets, such as Bhushan Steel or Bhushan Power. At the same time, the century-old company is expanding its business.“Tata Steel is actually encouraged by the response from its earlier round of fund raising,” said another source.The issue would be different from the company’s $2.5-billion loan recast. Earlier last month, ET reported that Tata Steel raised $1.3 billion by selling dollar-denominated bonds to overseas investors, who rushed to grab the high-yielding securities. It obtained oversubscription in excess of $7 billion, reflecting strong investment appetite for such papers. The Tatas are refinancing around $1.5 billion loans housed in its Singapore subsidiaries such as TS Global Holdings Pte and NatSteel Asia Pte.Abja Investment Co Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, was the actual issuer of the bonds, rated as BB- by S&P, two notches lower than investment grade.JSW Steel, another large steel company, is also planning to raise $1.5 billion, or about Rs 9,620 crore, through overseas syndicated loans as it looks to buy stressed assets in the industry, ET reported on February 15.The Tatas and JSW are some of the firms aggressively bidding for debt-laden assets, which lenders have put on block to recover their loans.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-steel-may-raise-up-to-900-million-via-overseas-loan/articleshow/63003493.cms

2018-02-25,"LONDON: Tata Steel is seeking UK government backing for a 60-million-pound project at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, according to a media report today.The project is aimed at overhauling a production line at Port Talbot to be able to make lighter steel for car-making, which is expected to secure the future of Britain's largest steel operation.The Indian steel giant is believed to have informally requested financial support from the government to upgrade its Continuous Annealing Process Line (CAPL) to make lighter, thinner and stronger galvanised steels, the Sunday Times reported.The move is aimed at meeting demands from the automotive sector, which is trying to slash the weight of cars to cut emissions.Industry sources told the newspaper that UK taxpayer support for the CAPL upgrade was integral to Tata committing to reline an ageing blast furnace.Without the extra investment, one of the two towering furnaces that convert iron ore into molten iron is due to finish operations by the end of next year.Tata Steel is understood to be working on a plan to extend the furnace's life until about 2026. However, this plan falls short of a full relining, which would cost about 150 million pounds.Maintaining Port Talbot's two furnaces is seen by workers' unions and the UK government as crucial to the survival of the plant, which has about 4,000 workers.In September 2017, UK business secretary Greg Clark wrote to Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, asking for a ""specific commitment"" to the relining.Chandrasekaran said overhauling the site would help ""develop the business viability"" for the reline -- but fell short of a commitment.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-seeks-uk-government-funds-for-wales-plant-report/articleshow/63067646.cms

2018-02-26,"NEW DELHI: Tata Steel's bidding for Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel is nothing new for the Tata Group firm, which has a history of aggressively pursuing growth opportunities over the last decade.But this time, there are concerns that the firm may end up shelling out higher-than-perceived price for the two stressed companies, just when things were looking up for the steelmaker. The firm had recently hived off its European business and prepared a blueprint to ramp up production at Kalinganagar plant.ValuationsTata Steel had submitted Rs 24,500-crore bid for Bhushan Power against JSW's Rs 11,000 crore bid. The steelmaker also had reportedly bade Rs 35,000-crore for Bhushan Steel, which is higher than JSW's Rs 29,700 crore bid.Market watchers tracking the sector believes that the valuations (EV/tonne) for the two non-integrated flat steel product producers, estimated at $1,125-1,225 per tonne based on various media reports, would be higher than the industry standard of $1,000 per tonne for an integrated plant. Even phase-II expansion at Kalinganagar plant is valued at $750 per tonne.Investors may fail to ascribe a value to this strategic deal in the short-term, they say, even as it will help the company double its capacity by FY22 to become the largest domestic steelmaker.""The market was thinking that the stressed assets will be sold out for a very low value. The only issue is that the market participants do not have that kind of long-term view and, therefore, they would take it with little bit of pinch of salt in the short term,"" Rakesh Arora, MD, Go India Advisor told ET Now.Debt trapWith the acquisition, the debt of Tata Steel is seen peaking at Rs 92,000-1,00,000 crore. But setting up new greenfield projects too isn't easy.Many big steelmakers such as JSW Steel, Essar Steel, Ispat Industries and Sail have in the past plunged into debt trap, thanks to project delays, high interest cost and cyclical nature of the steel industry, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.""Despite strong free cash flows from Jamshedpur, Tata Steel too faced multiple delays, escalation of project cost and a drag on its balance sheet for its Kalinganagar project in Odisha. These sites have been able to create shareholder value because their incremental specific capex is lower,"" it noted.The brokerage believes that Tata Steel can leverage its captive iron ore mines and drive market synergies.Strategic senseThe acquisitions may help Tata Steel raise production capacity to 21 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) from the current 13 MTPA. Edelweiss Securities see ebitda for the steelmaker improving to Rs 11,000 per tonne (from Rs 7,800 per tonne at 58-60 per cent utilisation rate) through enhanced capacity utilisation, efficient raw material sourcing and operating synergies, the company's market leadership in automotive steel segment and possibility of further brownfield expansion at Bhushan Steel.""Bhushan Steel has got value added plants at Ghaziabad as well as Khopoli which are generating profits. It is very active in auto sector as well as other value-added products. Besides, the commodity cycle has undergone a change, especially in regard to developments in China. In addition, Tata Steel would have factored in the synergies in terms of raw material linkage from their mines as well as other synergies in terms of logistics, procurement as well as marketing,"" SK Roongta, Former Chairman, SAIL & Industry Expert told ET Now.Global steel price on a riseSteel prices are on a rise following the imposition of output cuts by China to help meet emissions targets during the winter months from mid-November to mid-March. Fitch Ratings in a note pointed out that hot-rolled steel sheet spot prices in China have increased to $650/tonne from around $450 in April 2017 on improved demand-supply scenario and increase in raw material costs.Besides, China this month said that it may meet its target for reducing steel capacity by 150 million tonnes in 2018, two years earlier than previously planned.""Fitch believes steel prices may rise over the next couple of months while producers gradually ramp up output, though they are likely to reduce thereafter,"" it said.What analysts sayAt the prevailing price, the stock is trading at 5.5 times FY20E ebitda, which should rise to 6.5-6.6 times in FY20 due to higher leverage if the transaction is successful, said Edelweiss Securities. The brokerage has a 'Buy' rating on the stock.Motilal Oswal Securities says the two companies can produce 7-8 million tonnes saleable steel with current facilities. The business models are similar to JSW Steel. Operating cost for JSW Steel is lower as its furnaces are much larger, while it pays slightly more for iron ore due to its location. JSW Steel pays less outward freight due to proximity to market, the brokerage noted.""Therefore, we believe the two firms' ebitda per tonne are likely to be either same or a tad lower than JSW Steel's margins of Rs 7,000-9,000 across cycle. Assuming Rs 8,000 average ebitda per tonne across the cycle, the valuation at 8.5 times EV/ebitda appears expensive compared to sector average of 6 to 7 times. The target price may get eroded by 13 per cent to Rs 677,"" the brokerage said while maintaining a neutral stance on the stock.According to DK Aggarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of SMC Investments and Advisors, the steel sector in India, which had been under stress due to lack of demand, is finally picking up. Economic reforms initiated by the government have provided extensive support to the industry.“Though we many not witness it immediately, the fundamental conditions for growth are in place and are positive. One may invest in stocks such as Tata steel and SAIL for the long term,” Aggarwal added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-steel-may-double-capacity-with-bhushan-steel-but-short-term-drag-likely/articleshow/63083063.cms

2018-03-24,"KOLKATA: Tata Steel’s acquisition of Bhushan Steel is all but complete, with regulatory approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) left to be obtained.The deal will mark the successful conclusion of the resolution process for the first of 12 big defaulters that the RBI had asked lenders to refer to the NCLT in June 2017 under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The company said on Friday it had accepted the letter of intent for Bhushan Steel under the corporate insolvency resolution process of the IBC. Earlier, it had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a Rs 35,000-crore offer, paving the way for the acquisition of a five million tonne plant in Odisha with a product basket catering to high-value auto and consumer durable makers.Growth StrategyTata Steel has beaten rival JSW Steel and a private equity backed group of employees.“Tata Steel hereby informs that it has been declared as the successful resolution applicant by the committee of creditors of Bhushan Steel,” the company said in a press release. Bhushan Steel owed nearly Rs 56,000 crore to creditors.The company didn’t respond to ET’s queries seeking details about how it would go about making the acquisition, including its structure.The move is a key step forward in Tata Steel’s domestic growth strategy under new Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran, a former top executive of the company said. Targeting Bhushan Steel was part of a well-thought-out strategy by the Tata group after assessing Bhushan Steel’s assets such as its mines and the age of its plant, which is relatively new and operational, compared with other stressed steel assets on the block, the person added.Analysts tracking the sector said they were surprised by Tata Steel’s aggressive offer outbidding that of JSW Steel and one from about 400 Bhushan Steel employees backed by a PE firm. Tata Steel is also lead bidder for Bhushan Power & Steel, another of the dozen companies that RBI had instructed banks to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against.“Tata Steel will almost double its capacity in India in the next four to five years if it manages to win both Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel and after taking into consideration the second phase of its expansion in Kalinganagar,” ICRA senior vice president Jayanta Roy said.Debt RestructuringThe Bhushan Steel resolution had its share of drama. At the end of January, Bhushan Steel promoter and vice chairman Neeraj Singal unsuccessfully sought to halt the process by writing to lenders and asking them to consider restructuring the Rs 56,000-crore debt under the sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) mechanism by dividing the debt into sustainable and unsustainable parts with no haircut. The January 29 letter alleged that the company had been wrongly dragged into the IBC process despite the fact that debt restructuring under S4A was close to being decided.Tata Steel had submitted an expression of interest (EoI) for Essar Steel as well, then said it would partner with Nippon Steel on this but eventually didn’t participate. However, bids are being sought afresh for Essar Steel with all those who submitted EoIs being eligible to try again. Tata Steel didn’t comment on queries regarding its participation in the rebid.With Tata Steel tipped to enter into a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp of Germany for its European steel business, the focus is clearly back on India. Tata Steel’s domestic capacity is 13 million tonnes, which will be augmented by 5.6 million tonnes with the Bhushan Steel acquisition. Bhushan Steel makes flat products like hot- and cold-rolled coil (HR/CR coils) and galvanised sheets. It also collaborated closely with Sumitomo Corp., now Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. Incidentally, Tata Steel has a 51:49 joint venture with Nippon Steel for automotive steels that has a leading share of that market in India.On March 7, Tata Steel said it had received a formal communication from the resolution professional of Bhushan Steel that it had been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-on-brink-of-buying-bhushan-steel-awaits-nclt-cci-green-signal/articleshow/63438178.cms

In the event of additional purchase of shares by Tata Steel, the remaining 2% will be held between lenders, shareholders and promoters.However, if Tata Steel chooses to not exercise its right to buy additional shares, Bhushan Steel’s shareholding pattern will feature 75% to Tata Steel, 13% to lenders, 10% to public and remaining 2% to promoters.For the quarter ending March 2018, the promoter and promoter group held 43.9% of the share capital, down from 57.82% at the end of December.The rest was held by public whose shareholding increased from 42.18% in December to 56.1% for March.

2018-04-19,"German steel giant Thyssenkrupp expects its proposed joint venture with Tata Steel Europe to be finalised by the end of this calendar year, a senior company official said here today. Both the companies in September last year had announced plans to combine their European operations and form an equal joint venture, creating Europe's second largest steel maker, after ArcelorMittal. ""The JV is an ongoing process. The talks with UK labour union are on and we expect closure by end of current calendar year,"" Jens Overrath, chairman of the executive board, Thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel told reporters here. He was speaking on the sidelines of an event to inaugurate the expanded cold rolled grain oriented (CRGO) electrical steel unit at Nashik in Maharashtra. The company plans to produce 35,000 million tonnes (mt) per annum of CRGO electrical steel used in transformers for power sector from the expanded factory, against the current capacity of 10,000 mt. ""India is a very important market for us and we are the only manufacturers of CRGO steel in the country. The expansion will enable us to enhance the innovative approach that we take towards all our products, thereby providing cutting edge technology to all our offerings,"" he said. The country's demand for this specialised steel is estimated at 400,000 mt, which is being met by imports at present. Overrath said the new product line set-up will help in meeting the continuously increasing demand of cold rolled grain oriented in the Indian market. The company also hopes to shift its exports to Asia from European plants to the Nashik unit.

2018-04-23,"Mumbai: Tata Steel, which emerged as the successful bidder for stressed alloy maker Bhushan Steel in the bankruptcy process, is raising up to Rs 17,000 crore in loans from a consortium of about six private and foreign financiers, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.The company is in talks with lenders including HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, DBS Bank, Kotak Bank Mahindra Bank and mortgage financier HDFC Ltd.Standard Chartered Bank declined to comment on the matter while other banks did not respond to ET’s emails until the publication of this report. Queries sent to Tata Steel remained unanswered.“The loan should be priced and finalised this week as talks are going on at an advanced stage,” one of persons cited above told ET. The loan amount could be anywhere between Rs 13,000 crore and Rs 17,000 crore. The debt could be a combination of longterm and short-term bridge loans.A bridge loan is a short-term loan utilized to remove an existing obligation.Earlier on March 23, Tata Steel said it had accepted the Letter of Intent (LoI) for Bhushan Steel under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 after the committee of creditors declared Tata Steel as the successful bidder. The decision is subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, including approval from the National Company Law Tribunal and the Competition Commission of India.Tata Steel proposed to pay Rs 35,200 crore to buy Bhushan Steel, an acquisition that is slated to significantly bolster its portfolio of value-added flat steels used in consumer durables and cars. Bhushan Steel’s mines and manufacturing presence in Odisha complements Tata Steel’s growing operations in the state where it commissioned its new steel plant at Kalinganagar a few years back. The acquisition is in line with Tata Steel’s aggressive growth plans that aim to double its domestic steel capacity.The employees of Bhushan Steel had moved the NCLT objecting to the eligibility of Tata Steel, citing IBC provisions. Later, the NCLT directed the committee of creditors to consider the employees’ viewpoint. But it was finally set aside.The company may acquire threefourths of Bhushan Steel’s share capital by an equity infusion in it while lenders would also raise their stake by converting a part of the outstanding loans into stock, ET reported last week.“Tata Steel will be paying Rs 180 crore to acquire 75 per cent of the paid up share capital by issuing 120 crore new shares as part of its plan to salvage the debt-laden steel company,” sources in the know said.The extended resolution period for Bhushan Steel ended on April 22. The company’s insolvency resolution process plea was admitted by the NCLT on July 26 last year. The NCLT granted additional 180 days to draw the revival of the company.“We believe, these assets can produce 7-8 mt saleable steel with current facilities,” Sanjay Jain and Dhruv Muchhal, research analysts with Motilal Oswal, said in a report. “On consolidation, net debt will increase by Rs 544 billion (or more) at the end of FY20.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-steel-plans-to-raise-rs-17000-crore-from-six-lenders/articleshow/63875628.cms
2018-04-23,"Software biggie TCS has delivered multibagger returns to investors since its listing in August 2004. What comes as the icing on the cake is it became the first Indian IT company on Monday to enter the $100 billion club in terms of market capitalisation under the group chairman N Chandrasekaran.That means an investment of just Rs 10,000 on the listing day would have now become over Rs 1.40 lakh (ex-dividend), translating into a return of over 1,300 per cent.Chandrasekaran as the captain has seen the IT boat transforming into a giant ship, which has grown at an ""enormous"" pace over the years.During the past one year, TCS has delivered over 45 per cent return to investors till April 20, managed to outpace 18 other Tata Group companies, including Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Coffee, Indian Hotels, Tata Chemicals and Tata Power, among others. Back in 2004, Chandrasekaran was one of the directors of TCS. He took over as the chief executive officer of the IT major on November 6, 2009. Chandrasekaran became the first non-Parsi chairman of Tata Sons on February 21 last year after the unceremonious ouster of Cyrus Mistry.Market capitalisation of TCS is now Rs 80,000 crore more than its nearest oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries. With a market capitalisation of Rs 6.72 lakh crore, TCS stock traded nearly 3 per cent up at Rs 3,506 early today.During the last one year, Tata Group stocks have rallied up to 186 per cent, with Tinplate Company surging to Rs 248.55 on April 20 this year, from Rs 87 on the same day in 2017. Nalco, Titan Company, Tata Global and Voltas all rallied between 50 per cent and 125 per cent during the same period. Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga said, “Chandra has managed TCS very well till date. We assume that other group of companies in his focus will also flourish in coming years.”On the journey of TCS, former CFO, S Mahalingam, in a chat with ET Now said, “We were just about 25 people in 1970 and therefore, none of us imagined that we would ever see the landmark. We have created a whole bunch of technologies which can satisfy the state of the art requirements of anyone in the world and last of all, it is the leadership which started with Kohli pioneering it. It was Ramadorai who really scaled it up and Chandra who gave it an aggressive push, and now Rajesh really leading from the front along with N Ganapathy Subramaniam. I think there has been a phenomenal journey.”Investors on Dalal Street are hoping for healthy returns from relative laggards such as Tata Motors, Tata Power, Tata Communications, Rallis India, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), TRF and Tayo Rolls.Tata Motors declined 24 per cent during the past one year and 37 per cent in the last three years whereas Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) plunged 20 per cent and 31 per cent during the same periods. Other stocks such as Rallis India, Tata Power, Tata Coffee and Tayo Rolls also need a Midas touch from Chandra.Tayo Rolls and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) have been reporting losses for many quarters now. For the December quarter, Tayo Rolls posted a net loss of Rs 7.84 crore while Tata Teleservices Maharashtra suffered a net loss of Rs 480.75 crore. Tata Power and Rallis India reported 7.17 per cent and 1.58 per cent year-on-year decline in net profit, respectively, in Q3 FY18. However, Tata Motors reported over 10-fold jump in quarterly profit in October-December, driven by higher sales from its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) business after a particularly weak quarter a year earlier. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal sees nearly 11 per cent annual rise in net profit in Q4 FY18 of Tata Motors. The brokerage firm has ‘Buy’ rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 528.According to recent reports, Chandrasekaran has asked Tata Motors to create value for the group, especially from its domestic business, in line with his objective of making Tata group companies more accountable.G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory, said, “The falling rupee along with the robust performance of TCS in terms of business supported the share price of the IT major. Seeing the share price movement of Tata Motors and Tata Steel, it is too early to comment on Chandrasekaran's leadership. Titan has inherited a growth story.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/after-tcs-will-chandras-midas-touch-work-its-magic-for-tata-motors-tata-steel/articleshow/63878533.cms
2018-04-25,"MUMBAI | KOLKATA: Tata Steel, which was so far leading the race in acquiring Bhushan Power & Steel, is contemplating challenging an order passed by the bankruptcy court that directs the resolution professional to consider Liberty’s application, despite it being filed after the deadline. Two senior officials, who did not want to be named, said Tata Steel will approach National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on the grounds that it would amount to penalising those who are law observers and reward violators. Liberty House had submitted a resolution plan for Bhushan Power & Steel on February 20, although the last day of submitting bids was February 8. When the resolution professional declined to open the bid on grounds that it was submitted after the deadline, Liberty approached the bankruptcy court to question the RP’s decision. While Tata Steel is likely to be disappointed with the court’s directive, it has not spoken out against it. When contacted, a Tata Steel spokesperson said he was aware of the matter. Asked whether Tata Steel is planning to appeal against the NCLT order, the official said the company may take a couple of days to firm up its response. For Tata Steel, it could be a frustrating experience since the company had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Power with a Rs 24,500-crore offer, outbidding JSW Steel which put in a Rs 13,000- crore bid. Officials agreed the Tata Steel-BPSL scenario is turning out to be somewhat similar to the Binani Cement case, where UltraTech Cement came into the fray after Dalmia Bharat emerged as the highest bidder. Incidentally, Tata Steel has already accepted the Letter of Intent (LoI) for Bhushan Steel and, together with BPSL, it was hoping to add almost 8 million tonne capacity that would take it to the top league of the domestic steelmakers, including Steel Authority of India and JSW Steel. At the bankruptcy court, the Tata’s had appealed that the applicant (Liberty House) is nothing but a spoiler and a proxy for the debtor whose only objective is to delay and scuttle the resolution process. In their argument, the lenders had alleged that Liberty has deliberately delayed their applications. The resolution professional argued that Liberty’s application is a complete abuse of the process. Senior Counsel for RP, Arun Kathpalia also pointed out that Liberty House failed to submit documents required for qualification and there was noncompliance of Section 29 A, and it failed to provide Rs 10 lakh deposit as per the mandate. The Tatas had also stated that allowing Liberty would set a bad precedent in IBC and entertaining such application would penalise the law-abiding participants and reward violators. The counsel for creditors argued that allowing the present application would open floodgates for other applications. Liberty had appealed on the ground that the RP had accepted two applications — ArcelorMittal’s and their application — for expression of interest much after the deadline of October 6, which means that deadline was neither sacrosanct nor considered binding. Bhushan Power is among the 12 companies wherein the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed the bank to refer to the bankruptcy court. It faces .`49,264 crore claims from financial creditors. Lenders had received binding offer from JSW Steel and Tata Steel before the deadline on February 8.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-may-dispute-libertys-bhushan-bid/articleshow/63904166.cms

2018-04-27,"New Delhi: Sanjeev Gupta-led Liberty House Group has sought to trump a bid by Tata Steel to buy bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel, according to people directly briefed on the matter.The committee of creditors of Bhushan Power and Steel met on Friday to open UK-based Liberty House’s bid for the company at the direction of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The creditors’ panel is yet to fully evaluate the offer’s terms, they said.Liberty House has offered an upfront payment of Rs 18,500 crore to lenders of Bhushan Power and Steel against an upfront offer of Rs 17,000 crore by Tata Steel, these people said. It has also offered to honour bank guarantees obtained by the steel maker for certain financial commitments as well as a working capital infusion into the company, the quantum of which ETcould not immediately ascertain.Tata Steel had offered a working capital infusion of Rs 7,500 crore in the company and payouts to employees and operational creditors.Tata Steel’s offer may still be more attractive if it were to modify certain terms, according to a banker in the know of things, although Liberty’s offer was compelling due to better and more immediate recovery of dues.A spokesperson for Liberty House said in response to ET's queries, “Yes, our bid was opened today by the CoC and we are looking forward to work with the creditors and resolution professional on the next steps.” Tata Steel didn’t respond to queries. When asked about its interest in Bhushan Power and Steel, Tata Steel had said in January: “As a process, we do assess and evaluate various strategic opportunities for growth. This is an ongoing process in the company.” Mahender Khandelwal, Bhushan Power and Steel’s resolution professional, declined to comment.LATE ENTRYLiberty House’s bid had initially been rejected by the committee of creditors led by SBI because it was made after the February 8 deadline for submission of binding offers. Tata Steel had emerged the highest bidder at the time, exceeding an offer by JSW Steel, the only other contender to have submitted a binding offer for the company as ET first reported on February 19.Liberty House, an outlier, didn’t participate in the process after submitting an initial expression of interest, but later submitted a surprise bid on February 20. After the bid was rejected, the company approached the NCLT in appeal. The tribunal passed an order in its favour on April 23, directing the resolution professional to open the bid.WHAT NEXTThe committee of creditors will meet again next week to weigh both the offers, though sources did not rule out Tata Steel challenging the decision to allow Liberty House's late bid for the company to be opened in the NCLT. There’s also a possibility of bids being sought afresh, said a person familiar with the matter.Bhushan Power and Steel is owned by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that owns listed Bhushan Steel, which is also undergoing insolvency proceedings.The debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel owes a consortium, comprising over two dozen banks, Rs 48,524 crore.

2018-05-09,"KOLKATA: Tata Steel, the successful resolution applicant for Bhushan Steel, is facing resistance in its efforts to assert control over the company’s main plant at Dhenkanal in Odisha, according to people with knowledge of the development. As one of the first high-profile cases to be resolved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), how the process plays out through to takeover and recovery is being keenly watched, experts said.Representatives of Tata Steel are allegedly being intimidated by people close to the former promoter of the company, said the people cited above. They have been visiting the facility and interfering with the business, sources said. There was no response to queries that ET emailed to Bhushan Steel’s former promoter Neeraj Singal. When reached on the phone, he declined to comment.'PLAN TO RETAIN PERMANENT STAFF'Asource close to Bhushan Steel said however there was labour unrest at the plant because of fears over job losses. “The Tatas have apparently said they would retain only BSL’s permanent employees,” he said. “This has given rise to misgivings among contractual workers who play a major role in a steel plant which cannot be run by permanent employees alone.”When contacted, Tata Steel said: “We do not have any comment to offer in the matter.” Dhenkanal district collector Nikhil Kalyan said the administration has sought to reassure the workforce. “There were apprehensions about possible job losses,” he said. “The plant is operating at a low capacity of around 35-37%. We assured them that with the Tatas due to take over, the plan is to push up production to around 70-80%. This will entail a much higher manpower requirement.”The situation is under control, he said. “We will request the new owners to consider these people for various jobs including contractual ones,” he added. “However, no commitment can be expected for land losers and project affected people who have already been compensated.” He was referring to those who gave up land for the plant.OUT-OF-TURN PROMOTIONSOn the other hand, the people cited above said the trouble stemmed from the outgoing management giving out-of-turn promotions to employees close to the former promoters. Assets were also being sold cheaply to unidentified parties, they alleged.However, sources close to BSL strongly refuted these allegations saying these were completely untrue since the resolution professional (RP) is now in charge of the administration and the assets of the plant. Adding to the strife is the delay in the process of handing over the 5.5-million tonne asset because the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is still receiving petitions from employees, unions and suppliers regarding Tata Steel’s bid.Tata Steel had emerged as the successful resolution applicant for Bhushan Steel with a Rs 35,500 crore offer and was subsequently issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) on March 23. Bhushan Steel owes about Rs 55,000 crore to creditors. “Bidders are witnessing potential depletion in value as NCLT is taking a long time to finalise orders,” said one of the persons cited above. “The integrity of the process and the timeline set under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is being compromised.”The situation has given rise to questions regarding the power of the resolution professional and the committee of creditors (CoC) to prevent misappropriation of assets. “While the IBC says control of asset is to be given with a time frame, the reality is different. This will impact lenders too,” said one of the persons cited above.Sources said the former promoter and associates had been visiting the unit, as recently as last week, interacting with employees and participating in rituals in the temple inside the complex. The HR department was apparently instructed to give promotions to a number of employees recently, though it is not clear whether this happened while the resolution application process was underway. Tata Steel’s representatives are allegedly being prevented from entering the premises. However, the source close to Bhushan Steel denied this: “The Tatas are yet to visit the plant,” he said.TIME-BOUND PROCESSPabitra Biswal, general secretary of the BSL Sharmik Sabha trade union, has been voicing his concerns about the fate of contractual workers, said one of the persons cited above. About 150 people who gave up land for the plant and underwent vocational training, having been promised jobs, had met the collector to ask about their prospects. On the issue of promotions, the source close to Bhushan Steel said it was a question for the resolution professional Vijaykumar Iyer. Iyer didn’t respond to calls and text messages.The IBC stipulates a time-bound process for handing over assets and provides for local law and order support to the new owners, said Alok Dhir of Dhir & Dhir Associates. “The time period between NCLT approval of a resolution plan and the effective transfer date for control of asset can range from six months to one year.”For proper supervision and monitoring of the resolution plan, a supervising or monitoring committee can be formed, especially if it involves the release of funds, he added. For instance, in the case of Binani Cement, an official was appointed to facilitate and ensure the handover was completed. “Once a plan is approved and sanctioned, it is the responsibility of the resolution applicant,” Dhir said. “In case the new owner is facing difficulty in taking over, he can file an application at the NCLT. If necessary, the court can then pass an order on it, including law and order support.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-facing-trouble-in-bhushan-steel-takeover/articleshow/64083767.cms
2018-05-09,"NEW DELHI: Tata Steel filed an appeal in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, challenging the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) order asking lenders to consider a late bid by UK’s Liberty House group for bankrupt Bhushan Power & Steel.Liberty House submitted a bid for Bhushan Power & Steel on February 20, well past the deadline for making binding offers for the company. The bid was initially rejected by the creditors but was eventually opened under directions from the NCLT on April 23.Tata Steel submitted its offer for the company on February 8, in adherence to the timelines. Its offer at that time exceeded that of JSW Steel, the only other bidder to have submitted a bid for the company, by a significant margin.Tata Steel’s bid provided for upfront payments of Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders and a working capital infusion of Rs 7,000 crore, ET had reported in February.Liberty House’s bid, opened by the committee of creditors of Bhushan Power and Steel on April 27, was higher than Tata Steel’s by Rs 1,500 crore — it offered an upfront payments of Rs 18,500 crore to creditors.The counsel for Tata Steel, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, had made arguments in the NCLT stating that Liberty House had an unfair opportunity as it was privy to details of the bids by Tata and the other bidders at the time it submitted a late bid.Singhvi declined comment when contacted on Tata Steel’s appeal. A spokesperson for Tata Steel didn’t respond to ET’s queries until press time Tuesday.Bhushan Power & Steel is promoted by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that owns Bhushan Steel, which is also undergoing insolvency proceedings.Tata Steel has emerged the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel in a tightly fought contest where it beat a bid by rival JSW Steel by a much smaller margin than it did in the case of Bhushan Power.It has already wrapped up financing arrangements for its acquisition of Bhushan Steel.Bhushan Power owes a consortium comprising over two dozen banks Rs 48,524 crore.

2018-05-10,"KOLKATA: Tata Steel has launched a new website, Aashiyana, to address the varied needs of Individual Home Builders (IHB), the core customer segment for its Rs 5,800-crore retail brand Tata Tiscon.Announcing the initiative the company said construction of homes in India continue to remain a desirable but challenging project for the average Individual Home Builder since lack of relevant guidance, ideas and information significantly limit a home builder’s capability to get his/her ‘dream home’ constructed. ""Aashiyana (aashiyana.tatasteel.com) is an online portal empowers home builders by providing them with relevant information, inspirational ideas and reliable contacts at their fingertips,"" the statement added. Ranging from a large range of architectural designs to browse and get inspired by, to finding a trusted service provider in their locality, the Aashiyana portal supports the home builders across their home building journey. It also offers customers a very convenient and reliable platform to purchase Tata Steel products such as Tata Tiscon rebars, Pravesh doors and windows and use them in the construction of their homes.Speaking at the launch of the initiative, Peeyush Gupta, Vice President – Steel (Marketing & Sales), Tata Steel, said: ""With this new digital portal, we will be able to engage early with our retail customers and foster long-term relationships with them. I am confident that Aashiyana’s offerings, including its convenient e-commerce platform, will enable Tata Steel to expand its retail footprint and grow its revenue from the B2C segment in India.”Sanjay S. Sahni, Chief of Marketing & Sales, Branded Products, Retail & Solutions, Tata Steel, said: “Tata Steel has several products in its portfolio to address the varied needs of the Individual Home Builder. Between lack of reliable information and not knowing whom to trust, home building is a very difficult task for an average person. Keeping these people in mind, we are delighted to have launched an innovative home building portal, Aashiyana, that will address various challenges that home builders in our country face. And we have only taken the first step in that direction and are really excited about the journey ahead for the Aashiyana portal.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-has-launches-new-website-aashiyana/articleshow/64110297.cms
2018-05-15,"KOLKATA: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday approved Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL), clearing the deck for the bankrupt mill’s acquisition by India’s oldest maker of the primary infrastructure alloy.The NCLT also dismissed a plea filed by the employees of Bhushan Steel opposing Tata Steel's bid. It also rejected another petition by engineering and construction major L&T, an operational creditor to Bhushan Steel: L&T had sought priority in repayment of debt in the resolution process.In a late evening statement Tata Steel said as per the terms of approved Resolution Plan, Bamnipal Steel Limited (`BNPL'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, will initially subscribe to 72.65% equity share capital of BSL at face value i.e. at Rs 2 per share, for an aggregate amount of Rs.158.89 crore. ""The financial creditors shall receive a total consideration of Rs 35,200 crores for the settlement of the existing financial debt of BSL,"" Tata Steel said. It will be funded through a combination of equity and inter-corporate loans, of which upto Rs 9,000 crore loans have an option of conversion into equity shares of BSL. The Resolution Plan also requires financial creditors to invoke pledge on existing equity shares of BSL.""As per the approved Resolution Plan, BNPL shall be classified as the 'promoter' of BSL, and the existing promoters shall be de-classified as 'promoters' of BSL for the purposes of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,"" the statement added. The NCLT nod will be a shot in the arm for Tata Steel which has been allegedly facing challenges on the ground in its efforts to assert control over BSL’s main plant at Dhenkanal in Odisha.On March 23, Tata Steel said it had accepted the letter of intent for Bhushan Steel under the corporate insolvency resolution process of the IBC after the Committee of Creditors (CoC) for BSL accepted its bid. Earlier, it had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a Rs 35,200-crore offer, paving the way for the acquisition of a five million tonne plant in Odisha with a product basket catering to high-value auto and consumer durable makers.In the race for BSL, Tata Steel had edged past JSW Steel and a private equity backed group of 400-odd Bhushan Steel employees. On March 7, Tata Steel said it had received a formal communication from the resolution professional of Bhushan Steel that it had been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel.Following NCLT approval the only other nod that is awaited is from the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Bhushan Steel owes nearly Rs 56,000 crore to its lenders.Acquisition of BSL will be a key element in Tata Steel's domestic growth strategy under new Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran. With Tata Steel tipped to enter into a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp of Germany for its European steel business, the focus is clearly back on growth in India.Tata Steel’s domestic steel capacity, now at 13 million tonnes, is poised to be augmented by 5.6 million tonnes with the Bhushan Steel acquisition. Bhushan Steel makes flat products like hot- and cold-rolled coil (HR/CR coils) and galvanised sheets.The resolution process for BSL, which was referred to NCLT in July 2017, has had its share of challenges. At the end of January, BSL promoter and vice chairman Neeraj Singhal had sought to halt the process by writing to lenders and asking them to consider restructuring the company’s debt under the sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) mechanism by dividing the debt into sustainable and unsustainable parts, with no haircut.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/nclt-approves-tata-steel-bid-for-bhushan-steel/articleshow/64171801.cms

Tata Steel has been allegedly facing ground level resistance in and around the BSL unit at Odisha, his comments are likely to ally concerns of contractual workers who are reportedly apprehending job losses after the proposed acquisition.For funding the Bhushan Steel acquisition, Narendran said, out of the Rs 35,000 crore, “we will put in Rs 18,000 crore from our own capital, balance will be met from additional debt”.“We did not create more trouble when we lost out on Electrosteel. We didn’t know when we were bidding for Electrosteel that there is just one chance so we learnt from it and didn’t take that chance in Bhushan. Value maximisation argument can go on for years,” Narendran said. Sharing the sales guidance for 2018-19, Narendran said the company hopes to sell 12.5 mt from India and another 10 mt from Europe. On the demand front, Narendran said there is a huge pull from auto sector. The quarter-on-quarter overall steel demand is in excess of 8-9%. “India hasn’t seen such demand in a long time, he added. Tata Steel is looking at a capex of around Rs 8,000 crore for the current fiscal, the company’s Executive Director & CFO Koushik Chatterjee said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-to-absorb-all-5000-employees-of-bhushan-steel/articleshow/64198688.cms

2018-05-17,"Tata Steel is among lowest cost producers of steel and irrespective of the prices, we should be profitable, says CEO & MD TV Narendran, talking to ET Now. Edited excerpts:How would you rate performance this year?Operationally we could have done better both in Europe and in India. In Europe, we have had some struggles in the UK because our facilities there need greater support in terms of maintenance and the equipment is a bit old. Ijmuiden, which is our Netherlands unit has typically been a top class performer, also had a difficult year for various reasons.We need to operate at a better level than we did last year because if you lose volumes, it impacts costs and if you are down for maintenance and shutdowns more often then you need to, then again it adds to the cost. These are factors which affected work for us because market conditions were favourable and the spreads were good. This year, we are looking to improve the operational performance.So, it is more internal problems as opposed to external issues like iron ore, coking coal etc?Absolutely, it is more internal.Then it would be safe to say as these things pass, your margins would improve..We have to do our job.Even if the US does impose all the protection measures that it wants to, there are still no concerns in relation to supply demand?I would say that not as much concerns but Tata Steel is one of the lowest cost producers of steel in the world and so irrespective of what the steel prices we should be profitable.You have got the green signal for Bhushan Steel acquisition from the tribunals. More than enough is being said about the legal processes and the hurdles that you have faced -- with bids from Liberty House etc. According to back-of-the envelope calculations, the acquisition cost is a bit lower than what most expected. How would you like to compare it with your Brownfield expansion in Kalinganagar? Would you say that you are being able to get Bhushan Steel asset at an attractive valuation?We look at it in a slightly longer term basis. Brownfield expansions will always be cheaper than Greenfield expansion but Bhushan Steel was probably the best asset on sale. It is a good facility with well-built facilities, identical to the blast furnace we have in Jamshedpur.Here you do not need to spend much capital to operate at rated capacity. Second. we know that it takes a long time to build a Greenfield site. So, having ready access to 5 million-tonnes capacity is great.And it produces long products…Bhushan Steel produces a small amount of Bhushan Power long products. So Bhushan Steel provides us with a ready access to a 5 million tonne site. It has taken us almost 10 years in Kalinganagar and we are not even at 5 million tonnes capacity. Look at the time value. It is only 150 kilometres away from our Kalinganagar site. The pluses are more than the minuses.So how long before you can finally go in and start?We wanted to go in tomorrow but today the appeal has gone to NCLAT. So, let us see what happens in the course of day today. The teams are ready to move in tomorrow if we get the clearance. My other concern is over debt. You recently had the rights issue and you were able to cut down debt significantly at least as on March 2018. Now of course you are going to be shelling out about Rs 35,000 odd crore for Bhushan Steel. You also have some ICD so it is going you to give you a good capture of the economic value in Bhushan Steel. What about debt, should investors be concerned about your debt levels elevating?The net debt is about Rs 69,000 crore on EBITDA of about Rs 22,000 crore. That is not too bad. Of course, we want to come to three and go below three over a period of time. Obviously the Bhushan Steel acquisition will push the numbers up a bit but it will also bring us EBITDA and that is why it is important for us to get the EBITDA very quickly. The advantage of an inorganic growth is it immediately get cashed unlike organic growth where you spend money for three-four years and then start getting the money out of it. The other thing we need to complete this year is the joint venture. Once we do that JV, about 2.5 billion euros of debt is supposed to move from the Tata Steel balance sheet to the JV balance sheet. So, that will also help us. We are very conscious of debt levels. We know what it means to operate at high debt levels. We have done it for most of the last 10 years. If you look at it structurally, what is happening in Tata Steel is most of the debt over the last 10 years had gone into the European operation whereas now most of the debt is going into the Indian operations which is generally a far healthier operation. This is because India is a growth market and it is a great place to produce steel because there are some structural advantages of having raw materials in India and a growing market. So, money is being put in the right place, in the right geography and to support the right ambitions for growth in India. We are far more comfortable with the leverage that we have today than we had may be five or ten years back.The fruit of the restructuring has clearly paid off when it comes to the pension scheme. From having a deficit, now you have a surplus which was even accounted for in your books. Going forward, how will the pension expense which is essentially debited to your P&L or the contribution that you are making to the scheme, change in the new BSPS versus the old BSPS.The new BSPS is a different structure. About 30% of the pensioners have shifted to the PPF which is the British Fund and 70% decided to stay on with the BSPS as we call it. Secondly, the BSPS is in some sense limited in its potential liability than the original pension scheme because in terms of the inflationary impact, there is a limit to how much it can grow, what is the liability and thus it limits the exposure that we have. We start with 120% kind of situation, which means we have a surplus. So, it is a good position to be in and it is more limited liability kind of structure than it was in the past.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/bhushan-steel-we-are-ready-to-move-in-tomorrow-if-we-get-the-clearance-says-tata-steel-ceo/articleshow/64207343.cms
2018-05-18,"Mumbai | Kolkata: Bamnipal Steel, a Tata Steel unit at the vanguard of the parent company’s current acquisition drive for insolvent mills, has raised about Rs 5,000 crore by selling commercial paper (CP), seeking to use the proceeds for immediate debt repayment.The special-purpose vehicle, created to help acquire Bhushan Steel as part of the broader insolvency resolution process, will be the financing conduit for Tata Steel’s Rs 35,200-crore acquisition of the debt-laden alloy maker from lenders. CPs are shortterm debt instruments issued by companies.Citibank and top mutual funds, including ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, Reliance Mutual Fund and Kotak Mutual Fund, have subscribed to the papers that offered about 8.5 per cent with threemonth maturities, three people familiar with the matter told ET. A small portion of the sum is of four-year maturity.“The short-term money may be used to repay lenders immediately. The issuer sold those papers directly to investors without any involvement of an arranger,” said one of the persons cited above.Tata Steel declined to make any official comment on the matter while emails sent to Citibank, and ICICI Prudential MF remained unanswered until the publication of this report. Birla Sun Life and Kotak could not be reached immediately for their comments, whereas Reliance MF declined to comment. A top source close to the development confirmed the Tata Steel unit’s fund-raising.On May 15, the National Company Law Tribunal approved Tata Steel’s bid for Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL), paving the way for the acquisition of the 5 million tonne steel plant. Tata Steel has also received a formal nod for the deal from the Competition Commission of India. Tata Steel had said that as per the terms of the approved resolution plan for Bhushan Steel, Bamnipal will initially subscribe to 72.65 per cent equity share capital of BSL at face value i.e. at Rs 2 per share, for an aggregate amount of Rs 158.89 crore.BSL’s financial creditors shall receive a total consideration of Rs 35,200 crore for the settlement of the existing financial debt of BSL. It will be funded through a combination of equity and inter-corporate loans, of which up to Rs 9,000 crore loans have an option of conversion into equity shares of BSL.Earlier on April 23, ET had reported that Tata Steel was raising up to Rs 17,000 crore in loans from a consortium of about six private and foreign financiers. The company was in talks with HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, DBS Bank, Kotak Bank Mahindra Bank and mortgage financier HDFC.The extended resolution period for Bhushan Steel ended on April 22.

2018-05-21,"NEW DELHI: The issue of safeguarding steel exports to the US by Tata Steel’s unit in the Netherlands amid Washington’s decision to impose tariff on this sector in Europe will top the agenda when Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte meets his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi here on May 24 as the two leaders try to devise a strategy to protect their mutual interests.The tariff on steel and aluminum is fast turning out to be a contentious issue for the US and European Union (EU), besides the Trump administration’s recent decision to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal.India and the EU, as part of a retaliatory measure, have given the World Trade Organization a list of US products that might incur higher tariff.ET has learnt that a crucial item on the agenda for discussion between Modi and Rutte on May 24 would be the imposition of tariff on steel exported by Europe as the issue impacts both countries.Some of the other subjects that might come up for discussions are the implications of US’ pullout from the Iranian nuclear deal, US-EU ties, and post-Brexit EU. Rutte will separately interact with the Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran. ""Tata Steel values its investments in Holland and is committed to building a sustainable future in the European Steel industry,"" a senior Tata Steel spokesperson told ET. Earlier in March, the Dutch wing of Tata Steel had urged the US to exempt it from the new import tariffs on steel and aluminium as its products are vital to the American economy. “We don’t dump our steel on the American market, our products are no threat to American national security and many American companies depend on our products,” Tata Steel Netherlands director Theo Henrar had said in a statement.Tata Steel’s Netherlands unit has major footprint in the US. From its factories in IJmuiden, near Amsterdam, Tata supplies high-quality steel to companies such as machine-builder Caterpillar and battery-maker Duracell. Tata also supplies products to carmakers and the packaging and bottling industry in the US. The Tata Group is one of the biggest foreign investors in the Netherlands.Rutte’s visit — his second in four years — will essentially be a business mission that will focus on agriculture, the clean Ganga initiative, startups, smart cities, port infrastructure, clean energy besides space and science & technology. Nearly 231Dutch business delegates, representing 130 companies, have registered and paid to join Rutte’s Trade Mission to India. The delegates represent various sectors, including agri-food, horticulture, logistics, education, smart cities, water, health and life sciences, IT and maritime.The EU said Trump’s steel tariffs could cost $1.5 billion and aluminium tariffs a further $100 million, and listed rice, cranberries, bourbon, corn, peanut butter and steel products among the US goods that it could target for retaliation. India said it was facing additional US tariffs of $31million on aluminium and $134 million on steel, and listed US exports of soya oil, palmolein and cashew nuts among its potential targets for retaliatory tariffs. Rutte is being accompanied by ministers for agriculture, foreign trade and international cooperation, infrastructure and water management, and medical care.One of Rutte’s key focus in Delhi would be the Clean Ganga mission as Netherlands has pioneering technology to clean rivers. The Netherlands, home to the world’s two biggest ports, is also keen to expand its footprints in the Indian port sector. Rotterdam and Amsterdam ports are gateway for Indian products to Europe, Eurasia and vice-versa. The cumulative investment from Netherlands to India was $23 billion between 2000 and December 2017 and the country is home to around 2,35,000 Indians, the highest in Europe’s mainland.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/pm-modi-dutch-counterpart-mark-rutte-to-find-ways-to-protect-tata-steel-exports/articleshow/64250686.cms

2018-05-21,"As far as Tata Steel is concerned, we continue to move ahead and respect the judicial process. Let's see what happens next, says TV Narendran, Global CEO & MD, Tata Steel, talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:Congratulations on winning the bid for Bhushan Steel. What made you come to the valuation of Rs 36,000 crore for Bhushan Steel? Do you expect the synergies to pan out for Tata Steel and Bhushan Steel at a later point of time?When we looked at this opportunity, we saw Bhushan Steel was probably the best asset on the block. It is pretty close to where we are already operating. It is in Odisha where we get a lot of support from the government. We see there is a lot of opportunity for synergy because it is a mill, we were very familiar with its configuration. It has got a furnace which we know very well. It has got a rolling mill which has excess rolling capacity and we probably have some extra slabs from Kalinganagar once we expand. So, in many different ways we saw a lot of synergies there. We also know how long it takes to build a steel plant in India. It has taken us more than 10 years to build Kalinganagar which is today a three million tonne plant whereas Bhushan is a five million tonne plant. So, we worked hard on it and we are happy we got it.Today the promoters of Bhushan Steel have also reached the NCLAT and they are challenging the fact that Tata Steel has won the bid for Bhushan Steel. How do you plan to take it forward at a later stage with respect to this and given the fact a proper due procedure has been followed by the committee of creditors as well in a case like this? Do you expect more legal challenges at a later stage?First of all, the promoters will do what they have to do. It is always difficult to lose an asset that you had created. We respect that but we have played it straight and square and Tata Steel has followed due process. We bid well. The committee of creditors are happy with it. We have already moved into the plants on Friday. The employees there have welcomed us. As far as we are concerned, we continue to move ahead and we respect the judicial process and we will wait to see what happens next.Will you look at any other assets that are currently undergoing the insolvency process after Bhushan Steel as well?We had bid for Electrosteel. We lost it. We are still in the running for Bhushan Power.

2018-05-22,"NEW DELHI: Dalal Street witnessed another session of brisk selling on Monday, as rising crude prices, falling rupee and BJP’s political setback in Karnataka marred investors' risk appetite.The S&P BSE Sensex slipped 232 points, or 0.67 per cent, to close at 34,616 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) lost 80 points, or 0.75 per cent, to settle at 10,516.The fifth straight day of losses for the domestic equity indices also saw momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signal bearish crossovers on 46 counters on NSE.Among the stocks that witnessed downward crossovers in Monday’s session included Indiabulls Real Estate, Firstsource Solutions, Tata Steel, Just Dial, Axis Bank, Adani Enterprises, Wipro and BEML.Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.Among other stocks that saw bearish crossovers were PNC Infratech, Intellect Design, Praj Industries, Windsor Machines, Kridhan Infra, Genus Power Infrastructure, CCL Products India, Aditya Birla Fashion, Omaxe and Suven Life Sciences.MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward trend or vice-versa.However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.Traders should use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm such a trend.Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers on 16 counters on Tuesday, signalling opportunities to buy these stocks ahead of a fresh bounce in prices.The stocks included Dwarikesh Sugar, Berger Paints, Mawana Sugars, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Uttam Sugar Mills.The Nifty50 index on Monday formed a bearish candle on the daily chart even as the index made lower highs and lower lows for the fourth consecutive session, suggesting that its supports were shifting lower. Analysts, however, said a small pullback cannot be ruled out.As long as the Nifty50 holds below 10,550, its weakness could extend till its next support at 10,440 and 10,400 levels, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities, who believes the index will face a hurdle at 10,600 on the upside.Understanding MACD A close look at the chart of the Axis Bank stock showed whenever the MACD line has crossed below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa.

2018-05-22,"NEW DELHI: Domestic giant Tata Steel today said it will raise Rs 16,500 crore through debt instruments to fund Rs 32,500 crore acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL). The remaining amount will be raised through internal resources, it said. The banks, according to industry experts, are expected to take a whopping haircut of about 30-35 per cent in the sale of BSL to an arm of Tata Steel. However, Tata Steel refused to comment on the haircut taken by the banks and financial institutions. ""We will be paying a total consideration of Rs 35,200 crores. This is expected to give us about 72.65 per cent equity in the company and close to 100 per cent of economic interest in the company because of the way in which the transaction has been structured,"" Tata Steel told in an e-mailed response. From a financing perspective, it said, the transaction is largely financed by ""our cash and incremental debt is only about Rs 16,500 crores which will be raised on the target balance sheet eventually"". The company said Bhushan Steel will have about Rs 16,500 crore of secured debt and it would be contributing significant amount of its own capital into the BSL, so the incremental capital structure will be healthy and sustainable for the future. ""And we believe that with synergies getting realized over a period of time, we have a good match between the earnings capability of the entire facilities and assets and the capital structure that we are putting in,"" it said. Stressing that Bhushan Steel has been a very important acquisition for the company, it said Bhushan Steel's Odisha plant is 150 kms away from Tata Steel's Kalinganagar plant. ""It is a running plant with good facilities and we believe it will complement our existing footprint, not only in Odisha but also in the important markets that we operate in. We hope to achieve a kind of 100 per cent ramp up in the next couple of years, and we see significant scope for additional synergies and improvement in the operating KPIs (key performance indicators),"" the steel giant said. Bhushan Steel is currently operating at around 3-3.5 million tonnes, Tata Steel said, adding that it expects the plant to be operational at 4-4.5 MT level quite easily. Bamnipal Steel Ltd (BNPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) last week.

2018-05-22,"Fresh from its Rs 35,200 crore acquisition of Bhushan Steel (BSL), the first of a dozen-odd insolvency cases to be resolved through the new bankruptcy law, Tata Steel is busy putting men and material in place for a smooth integration and a ramp up to BSL's nameplate capacity of 5.6 mt and make a success of its biggest and most recent acquisition in India. The company is at an 'exciting inflexion point,' Tata Steel Executive Director & CFO Koushik Chatterjee  told ET's Rakhi Mazumdar, as it continues to look for opportunities to raise capital to fund growth, while inching closer to forming a 50:50 joint venture with Thyssenkrupp of Germany.Tata Steel has recently been successful in acquiring stressed steel assets like Bhushan Steel through the IBC route. How was the experience?The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is certainly a big bold step to resolve corporate insolvency in India. The Code provides a platform where financially stressed businesses through a bidding process are put into the hands of owners who can operate them efficiently and the bad asset exposure of the banks also gets resolved. The Code is transformative because rarely has a legislation been formulated that has been put to practice from day one. It has been a learning experience for all stakeholders and I am sure the process will become more mature and fine-tuned as it goes forward. There are a lot of stakeholders in this process including the Lenders, the Resolution Professional, regulator like the IBBI, the judiciary and of course the Resolution Applicants like us. So this process requires a symphony to create the best outcome. It would be crucial to ensure that the 270-day timeline for resolution is followed as per the IBC.Can you de-construct the financial numbers and the mechanics for the acquisition of Bhushan Steel? The total cost of the acquisition is Rs 35,200 crore for settlement of the debt which has been paid upfront to the lenders of Bhushan Steel and novation of the remainder debt. As part of the Resolution Plan approved by NCLT, Bhushan Steel has issued new shares to Tata Steel which gives controlling interest of around 72% in the company while lenders will hold around 12% and the rest of the equity will be held by the existing shareholders. As you would expect, companies that are coming out of insolvency through the IBC process would have a minimal equity value if at all, and to illustrate as part of the Resolution Plan, Tata Steel subscribed to around 72% equity at a cost of Rs 159 crore.What is Tata Steel’s financing strategy for acquiring these companies. How will you fund it? Will it be a mix of internal and external resources?The overall capital structure for the transaction has been prudently designed keeping mind the potential earnings profile of the business. The acquisition has been funded by around Rs 18,000 crore of Tata Steel’s own capital including internal generation and around Rs 16,500 crore of debt drawn on the 100% owned subsidiary company, Bamnipal Steel which holds the equity of Bhushan Steel. The Bamnipal debt will be pushed down to Bhushan Steel and will be serviced by the company and the incremental debt equity of the acquisition has been kept at around 1x. Tata Steel’s own capital structure has also recently improved following the robust earnings and the successful completion of the Rights Issue earlier in the year. How do you look at the valuation of the acquisition? Having built a new greenfield capacity in the last few years, considering the stage of the commodity cycle and strong fundamentals of the industry in India, it is obvious one of the key valuation basis for us was the time-adjusted replacement cost of the facilities. The time value of money is critical for the time large greenfield projects in India take for land acquisition and clearances and secondly the time to build and ramp up fully is also in excess of 40 months. Hence, a greenfield project of 5MTPA HRC and 2MTPA CR mill will easily require a capex of Rs 31,000 crore, assuming Rs. 5,100 crore per million tonne of HR capacity. This does not take into account the other downstream facilities Bhushan has. Assuming a four-year gestation period to build the facilities, the present value of four-year potential cashflows is another Rs.13,000 -15,000 crore. Even without the option value of future growth and the downstream value, the economics works outs to Rs.44,000 - 46,000 crore which compares favourably to our acquisition cost of Rs 35,200 crore.Are you looking for longer tenor loans from the domestic market? Tata Steel recently raised $1.9 billion from offshore credit market. Will you continue to tap the same route to refinance?Given the large size of the balance sheet, we have been always been looking at opportunities both domestically and overseas to raise capital based on our needs to fund growth, rebalance the tenure of the existing debt at attractive pricing and terms and have adequate liquidity buffer for the business requirements. The international bond transaction earlier this year was received very well with significant book build that helped us to price it very attractively. By when do you hope to stabilise Bhushan Steel financially? What kind of cost savings and synergies do you except from it? Within hours of closure of the formalities last Friday, we have deputed around 35 experienced managers including key managerial personnel to the company. They have had several levels of engagement with our new colleagues in Bhushan Steel and have enhanced their understanding of the company’s activities. The atmosphere has been warm and welcoming and we value that immensely. Our integration philosophy has always been to build partnerships with the ecosystem and work in a focused manner to enhance value for all stakeholders. People are the biggest assets of any organisation and its important that everyone is aligned to work collaboratively on improvements and realise synergies. We see a lot synergy potential in manufacturing, commercial, network optimisation, procurement and SG&A. Being in the proximity of our hubs in Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar will helps in realisation of synergies. Will you manage Bhushan Steel as separate entity or look at a merger?To start with it will remain as a separate entity. We will assess the situation going forward and act accordingly in the future. However, the integration priorities to ramp up capacity, focusing on asset productivity, leveraging Tata Steel’s operating excellence experience and realising cost and commercial synergies are not dependent on the legal structure. We have appropriate and adequate governance structure to drive synergies and integration. How would you help analyse the last quarter results, especially the operating performance and the completion of the UK pensions restructuring?We had a very strong operational performance in India with a EBIDTA margin of 30% for the quarter and our European performance improved on a quarter on quarter basis. The year end liquidity was also very strong with over Rs 22,800 crore of cash and cash equivalent. The pension restructuring in the UK is now complete following the Regulated Apportionment Arrangement (RAA) process that was approved by the UK pension regulator. We now have a new closed scheme following the member consent process with around 83,000 members. This represents around 69% of the members of the closed British Steel Pension Scheme who would continue to be members of the new scheme. The new scheme has an asset size of around 11 billion pounds while the liabilities are around 8.9 billion pounds as at March 31, 2018. The one off credit in the last quarter financial statement was more to reflect the non cash accounting treatment of the actuarial liabilities which reflects the surplus value of the assets over liabilities. This makes the scheme more sustainable for the future and allows it to pursue a low risk investment strategy. How is the JV with Thyssenkrupp progressing? Will you consider taking a majority stake in it? What kind of financial commitments will it involve? The discussion on the creation of the joint venture is advancing in good pace. As you would be aware, we have been in formal consultations with the various Works Councils in Europe regarding the merger. That process has progressed constructively and as potential shareholders of the new venture, we feel we have provided enough comfort and insight to all stakeholders that the proposed pan European joint venture will be in the best interest of all concerned. The joint venture will be a 50:50 equity ownership between the partners so the question of majority ownership at this point does not arise for either of the partners. Once the joint venture is formed, around € 2.5 billion of Tata Steel consolidated debt will be de-consolidated and move to the joint venture balance sheet. What keeps the CFO in you awake? A large acquisition and expansions at home and a merger abroad. How do you handle it?Tata Steel is at an exciting inflexion point and the Chairman and the Board has been guiding us through several strategic initiatives all of which has the potential to create significant value for the future. While many of these are challenging and complex, any professional team would look forward to these as an exciting opportunity to learn and contribute to the company’s long term goals. Having been in the role long enough, and being in a cyclical industry, we have gone through a lot of challenges especially in the last decade. However the organisational resolve and perseverance has been remarkable and I am fortunate to be part of such a very motivated, and capable and professional leadership team and I relish these challenges and opportunities to contribute.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/tata-steel-is-at-an-exciting-inflexion-point-koushik-chatterjee-cfo/articleshow/64278816.cms

Assuming a four-year gestation period to build the facilities, the present value of four-year potential cashflows is another Rs.13,000 -15,000 crore. Even without the option value of future growth and the downstream value, the economics works outs to Rs.44,000 - 46,000 crore which compares favourably to our acquisition cost of Rs 35,200 crore.Are you looking for longer tenor loans from the domestic market? Tata Steel recently raised $1.9 billion from offshore credit market. Will you continue to tap the same route to refinance?Given the large size of the balance sheet, we have been always been looking at opportunities both domestically and overseas to raise capital based on our needs to fund growth, rebalance the tenure of the existing debt at attractive pricing and terms and have adequate liquidity buffer for the business requirements. The international bond transaction earlier this year was received very well with significant book build that helped us to price it very attractively. By when do you hope to stabilise Bhushan Steel financially? What kind of cost savings and synergies do you except from it? Within hours of closure of the formalities last Friday, we have deputed around 35 experienced managers including key managerial personnel to the company. They have had several levels of engagement with our new colleagues in Bhushan Steel and have enhanced their understanding of the company’s activities. The atmosphere has been warm and welcoming and we value that immensely. Our integration philosophy has always been to build partnerships with the ecosystem and work in a focused manner to enhance value for all stakeholders. People are the biggest assets of any organisation and its important that everyone is aligned to work collaboratively on improvements and realise synergies. We see a lot synergy potential in manufacturing, commercial, network optimisation, procurement and SG&A. Being in the proximity of our hubs in Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar will helps in realisation of synergies. Will you manage Bhushan Steel as separate entity or look at a merger?To start with it will remain as a separate entity. We will assess the situation going forward and act accordingly in the future. However, the integration priorities to ramp up capacity, focusing on asset productivity, leveraging Tata Steel’s operating excellence experience and realising cost and commercial synergies are not dependent on the legal structure. We have appropriate and adequate governance structure to drive synergies and integration. How would you help analyse the last quarter results, especially the operating performance and the completion of the UK pensions restructuring?We had a very strong operational performance in India with a EBIDTA margin of 30% for the quarter and our European performance improved on a quarter on quarter basis. The year end liquidity was also very strong with over Rs 22,800 crore of cash and cash equivalent. The pension restructuring in the UK is now complete following the Regulated Apportionment Arrangement (RAA) process that was approved by the UK pension regulator. We now have a new closed scheme following the member consent process with around 83,000 members. This represents around 69% of the members of the closed British Steel Pension Scheme who would continue to be members of the new scheme. The new scheme has an asset size of around 11 billion pounds while the liabilities are around 8.9 billion pounds as at March 31, 2018. The one off credit in the last quarter financial statement was more to reflect the non cash accounting treatment of the actuarial liabilities which reflects the surplus value of the assets over liabilities. This makes the scheme more sustainable for the future and allows it to pursue a low risk investment strategy. How is the JV with Thyssenkrupp progressing? Will you consider taking a majority stake in it? What kind of financial commitments will it involve? The discussion on the creation of the joint venture is advancing in good pace. As you would be aware, we have been in formal consultations with the various Works Councils in Europe regarding the merger. That process has progressed constructively and as potential shareholders of the new venture, we feel we have provided enough comfort and insight to all stakeholders that the proposed pan European joint venture will be in the best interest of all concerned. The joint venture will be a 50:50 equity ownership between the partners so the question of majority ownership at this point does not arise for either of the partners. Once the joint venture is formed, around € 2.5 billion of Tata Steel consolidated debt will be de-consolidated and move to the joint venture balance sheet. What keeps the CFO in you awake? A large acquisition and expansions at home and a merger abroad. How do you handle it?Tata Steel is at an exciting inflexion point and the Chairman and the Board has been guiding us through several strategic initiatives all of which has the potential to create significant value for the future. While many of these are challenging and complex, any professional team would look forward to these as an exciting opportunity to learn and contribute to the company’s long term goals. Having been in the role long enough, and being in a cyclical industry, we have gone through a lot of challenges especially in the last decade. However the organisational resolve and perseverance has been remarkable and I am fortunate to be part of such a very motivated, and capable and professional leadership team and I relish these challenges and opportunities to contribute.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-is-at-an-exciting-inflexion-point-koushik-chatterjee-cfo/articleshow/64278356.cms

2018-05-24,"KOLKATA: Tata Steel has backed the valuation on the Bhushan Steel (BSL) acquisition, the first major successful resolution under the dedicated bankruptcy code, arguing that investment in a similar sized greenfield project would have led to significant time- and cost-overruns.“The time value of money is critical for greenfield projects in India… land acquisition and clearances, and the time to build and ramp up fully could easily take more than 40 months,” Koushik Chatterjee, CFO, Tata Steel, told ET.“Having built a new greenfield capacity in the last few years, and considering the stage of the commodity cycle and strong fundamentals of the industry in India, one of the key valuation metrics for us was the time adjusted replacement cost of the facilities,” Chatterjee said.A greenfield project of 5 million tonne per annum (MTPA) hot rolled coils (HRC) and 2 MTPA cold rolling (CR) mill will require a capex of Rs 31,000 crore, assuming Rs 5,100 crore per million tonne of HR capacity, plus cost of infrastructure.This does not take into account the other downstream facilities Bhushan has, Chatterjee said. Assuming a four-year gestation period to build the facilities, the present value of four-year potential cash flows is another Rs 13,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore.“Even without the option value of future growth and the downstream portfolio, the economic value will be in the range of Rs 44,000–46,000 crore, which compares favourably to our acquisition cost. Our focus will obviously be to leverage the asset footprint from the acquisition to create future value,” Chatterjee added.FINANCIALS BEHIND THE PURCHASEAnalysts have said the purchase will enrich Tata Steel’s automotive steel portfolio. “BSL’s presence in the value added, fast growing auto segment complements Tata Steel’s strategy. In our view, the transaction cost of $1,060/t is fair as it gives Tata Steel an opportunity to enhance its presence in the value-added auto segment,” Edelweiss Securities analyst Amit Dixit said in arecent report.The total cost of the BSL acquisition is Rs 35,200 crore for settlement of the debt, which has been paid upfront to the lenders of Bhushan Steel, and inovation of the remainder debt. As part of the Resolution Plan approved by NCLT, Bhushan Steel has issued new shares to Tata Steel, which gives controlling interest of around 72% in the company, while lenders will hold around 12%, and the rest of the equity will be held by the existing shareholders.Chatterjee said the overall capital structure for the transaction has been prudently designed, keeping in mind the potential earnings profile of the business. The acquisition has been funded by around Rs 18,000 crore of Tata Steel’s own capital, including internal generation and around Rs 16,500 crore of debt drawn on the 100% owned subsidiary company Bamnipal Steel that holds the equity of Bhushan Steel.COST SAVINGS AND SYNERGIESWithin hours of closure of the formalities last Friday, Tata Steel deputed around 35 experienced managers including key managerial personnel to the company across different operating sites, Chatterjee said. “They have had several levels of engagement with our new colleagues in Bhushan Steel and are enhancing their understanding of the company’s activities.

It would pay another Rs 1,200 crore over next 12 months to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.After the entire exercise, Tata would hold 75 per cent stake and banks would get 12.27 per cent.

""This Rs 28,592 crore offer in 14 years is a spoiler,"" he said.Meanwhile, senior advocate S Ganesh appearing for Singal submitted that Tata Steel was ineligible to bid for Bhushan Steel under section 29 A of IBC.The section mandates that a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more is ineligible for submitting a resolution plan.

2018-06-05,"The Odisha government is likely to introduce a condition in the auction of the next few iron ore and manganese mines, effectively barring Tata Steel from participating, to ensure it does not violate the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957. The move comes in the wake of a court order staying auction proceeding of two iron ore deposit that the steelmaker had bid for in April. Section 6(1) (b) of the Mines and Minerals Act allows a company mining rights for a mineral of up to a maximum of 10 sq km in a state. Any additional allocation must be justified by the state government in writing and approved by the Centre.Tata Steel’s iron and manganese (an associate mineral) mines in Odisha already exceed 50 sq km in area. “We would like to avoid a stay in the auction of these deposits,” said a senior state government official who asked not to be named. Odisha has been home to Tata Steel’s chrome, iron and manganese mines since almost a hundred years but most of these captive leases will lapse in 2030. Tata Steel’s participation in April auctions of two deposits for captive use — Chandiposhi and Purheibahal blocks with estimated reserves of 33.7 million tonnes and 38.3 mt, respectively — had been challenged in court by rival steelmaker JSW, pursuing its plans to set up a greenfield plant in Odisha. In early May, a bench of the Delhi High Court had stayed proceeding of the auctions, pointing out that Tata Steel was clearly ineligible under the MMDR Act, found the tender documents “speaking in two voices”. Earlier, in March the Naveen Patnaik government had written to the mines ministry at the Centre to extend the 10 sq km cap to 75 sq km to facilitate Tata Steel and state-run Steel Authority of India’s participation in the auctions. A similarly request, raising the limit for bauxite rights from 10 sq km to 50 sq km, had allowed PSU aluminium producer NALCO to get a second captive mine in the state. The court, in its order, noted that the Centre had not yet decided on Odisha’s request. “The Centre had certain queries, primarily as to what counts as an associated mineral,” said the Odisha government official quoted earlier. “We have cited sections of the Mineral Concession Rules that address this,” he said. A Tata Steel spokesperson declined to comment. Odisha’s directorate of mines will be soon inviting bids for Netrabandha Pahar block (17.2 million tonnes), Rengalbeda North-East block (27.28 million tonnes), Unchabali iron and Manganese block (3.6 million tonnes) and manganese block in Kalimati (0.68 million tonnes). Also on offer will be three limestone deposits that had failed to find any interest the last time they were tendered. Tata Steel had hoped the area cap to be raised to 120 sq km, a little less than the area of state capital Bhubaneshwar. The company has six iron ore and manganese mines in the state, but most of these leases will lapse 2030.

2018-06-21,"BHUBANESWAR: Tata Steel will start construction on the Rs 23,500-crore phase two of its Kalinganagar steel plant in Odisha on Friday, staying firm in its commitment of expansion of the project despite its recent acquisitions.Tata Steel managing director TV Narendran is expected to attend the ‘groundbreaking’ — a traditional ceremony to mark the first day of construction — of a 2.2 million tonne cold roll mill (CRM) on Friday, company officials said.  The CRM is planned for post-expansion annual production of 8 million tonne of crude steel and will allow Tata Steel to produce skin panels for car outer bodies from its newest plant, helping it retain leadership among domestic suppliers to auto and white goods sectors.The mill will be capable of producing steel of tensile strength as high as 12,000 MPa (mega pascal) and plates of 18-70 metre wide and up to 3 mm in thickness, said Rajiv Kumar, vice president, operations, at Tata Steel Kalinganagar. “The average thickness of plates though will be of 0.25 -0.5mm,” he said.With its Rs 35,200-crore acquisition of 5-million tonne Bhushan Steel announced last month, Tata Steel has become India's largest steel producer.Kumar said the Kalinganagar plant will focus on better serving automotive, pipelines, ship-building, yellow good (JCB, excavators) and oil and gas sectors. “Kalinganagar was conceptualised to be the most advanced steel plant anywhere in the world and we are trying to make the most of the facilities,” he said.It is already making steel for solar panels, and HS 800 grade steel for newer fuel efficient vehicles.“We were already producing X46 grade used for oil and gas pipeline, and trials are on for X70, the highest grade steel used in for oil and gas pipes,” Kumar said. “Trials of steel for long water and slurry pipelines are also underway.”The company is in the certification process with pipeline major Welspun Group.Kalinganagar has begun supplying tubes — the telescopic fronts of motorcycles on which the handles rest – to Chennai based Tubes India which was earlier totally import dependent, said Kumar. Tata Steel's newest facility is also able to offer superior experience of existing market products. “For example, you get 70 cylinders per tonne of HR coil produced here against the 63 cylinders from coil produced at Jamshedpur.”Kumar has been focussed on ramping up production, which began in May 2016, to three million tonnes annually. The “blip” that prevented it achieving full capacity last fiscal is behind them, he said. “March, April, May, June, every month we’ve produced 250,000 tonnes, which works out to an annual production of three million tonnes,” he said. Work is to soon begin on a state of art galvanising line, a continuous annealing line and another blast furnace that will add the five million tonnes to its capacity.Kalinganagar, spread over 3000 acres of land in Jajpur can accommodate a 16 million tonne plant, according to Kumar. Long-term raw material security was another story he would not be drawn into. “All I know is I have been promised raw material,” said Kumar.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-begins-work-on-phase-ii-at-kalinganagar-with-new-cold-roll-mill/articleshow/64687660.cms

2018-06-22,"Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor talks to ET Now about his favourites in auto, pharma, OMCs and commodity sectors.Edited excerpts:Does Tata Motors seem to be the haziest story in the auto pack right now?Yes and it is not that the street is just discovering that now! Tata Motors has been a rank underperformer compared to Nifty as well as other auto stocks in the last three years. That stock has either not given returns or has been in the negative in last 12 to 18 months.We can see a change in growth trajectory in Bajaj Auto and some of the other companies but in Tata Motors, the uncertainty on growth continues. More than 80% of earnings come from the JLR but a big question remains on how sustainable the growth is for JLR in China, Europe or US. The tariffs war development may be a couple of months old, but the Tata Motors growth disappointment or underperformance has been going on for at least 8 to 10 quarters now.Among auto stocks, which would be your top bet? Please do not say Maruti.Among auto stocks, in terms of two-wheeler companies Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto are the preferred bets . Otherwise, Maruti is a high conviction bet on declines. It has been on a slight downtrend where according to technical analysts, the supports lie. Fundamentally, in terms of valuations at about 80 times one year forward and about 16% to 18% growth being sustained for the next at least two-three years led by volumes, led by new product and variant launches, Maruti is a terrific story going ahead.OMCs were highlighted in trade yesterday. They have had a rough patch in the last six months. A good 25% to 30% odd correction has already played out in OMCs for the last quarter or so. Is there merit in nibbling into OMCs?OMCs had a dream run between 2015 and 2016-17 on back of low oil prices and lower underrecoveries/subsidy contributions. We are back to the scenario of five years ago with high crude prices and under recoveries and oil PSUs taking that additional burden because the consumer prices cannot be raised in line with crude prices. That is one side of the story. I would be neutral to negative on as far as the oil OMCs -- IOC, HP, BP -- are concerned. In HPCL, there is an additional complication of a merger with ONGC going through. That is going to cause some sort of disturbance in the stock price as well.How are you placing yourself in pharma?Vivek Mavani: I will break up pharma into three parts. Fortunately, all the three parts of pharma seem to be firing as far as the growth is concerned. If we look at the Indian pharma focussed on exports, they have had a rough run over the last two-three years on back of regulatory and USFDA and quality issues.The Halol unit of Sun Pharma getting certified a few days back is a huge shot in arm and a huge trigger on the export side. Domestic pharma has continued to consistently deliver earnings growth quarter of 15% odd, quarter after quarter, year after year.Cipla is a very interesting bet really. Among the midcaps, Cipla has no regulatory issues and a consistent growth story. Alkem and Ajanta Pharma are again interesting domestic consumption plays. The third leg which has been a rank underperformer over the last 12-13 years have been the multinational pharma companies. They seem to be coming back very strongly. Glaxo or AstraZeneca were forgotten names. I am sure an entire generation of young traders and investors probably have never even looked at some of these companies which were darlings of the markets may be 15 to 25 years ago. That segment seems to be coming back in a major way and I see lot of opportunities in multinational pharma as well.Do you have a call on Rites or Fine Organics?I have not really looked at Fine Organics. But the other IPO which is closing today, Rites is quite an interesting play. It is a consultancy business, asset light, with high return on capital, return on equity and generates free cash flows. It is also a debt-free company in the infrastructure consulting space. Major part of work is coming from railways and capex is being planned out over the next 5-10 years. Rites could be sustainable. It has a steady earnings growth story with the hefty payouts for investors going forward. Valuation too is also not very demanding. Rites is something worth investing in both in the IPO and on listing and the oversubscription numbers at the end of second day itself speaks about it.Coming on the commodities basket, is there still merit in looking at a Hindalco, Tata Steel as well as Vedanta at these levels?Commodities are an interesting sector. The China factor seems to be coming back but for a different reason. In commodities, I am not so bullish on Tata Steel or Hindalco but some of the other names like Jindal Steel and Power, which has a huge deleveraging story over the next two-three years. The gross debt would come down by almost Rs 15,000 crore from about Rs 42,000 crore of peak debt in 2017.In the next 18 months or so, the gross number should be around Rs 28,000-29,000 crore and driven by higher volumes which would jump from about 3.5 million tonnes to about 6 million tonnes by 2020. On back of higher prices, higher volumes, higher prices and a meaningful debt reduction, JSPL looks a better bet than Tata Steel. In the non-steel category, Hindustan Zinc looks attractive because zinc prices are still at elevated levels and Hindustan Zinc is quite an interesting bet with free cash flows, tonnes of surplus cash sitting on the balance sheet and expected hefty dividend payouts.When the Government of India will divest the 26% stake nobody knows but assuming that does not happen in the near future, just the earnings growth and dividend payouts are enough triggers for me.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/vivek-mavani-on-why-jspl-is-a-better-bet-than-tata-steel/articleshow/64692951.cms

2018-06-25,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel plans to raise Rs 12,000 crore via non-convertible debentures, the company said in a stock exchange filing on Saturday. It will seek shareholders' approval for the issue at the annual general meeting on July 20.The announcement comes after Tata Steel raised Rs 12,800 crore through a rights issue in March to fund capacity expansion at its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha.“We are continuously reviewing our financing requirements to fund the company’s growth projects and capital expenditure programmes and to maintain a strong liquidity position,"" the management said in the company’s annual report, referring to financing of its ongoing efforts in Kalinganagar as well as the acquisition of 3.5 million tonne Bhushan Steel that was under bankruptcy proceedings.In the financial year that went by, apart from the rights issue that was one of the largest in the country, ABJA Investment Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, also issued two tranches of $1.3 billion unsecured bonds in the international markets.The success of these issues is a testimony to the investors' confidence in the long-term strategy of the company, the steelmaker said in the report, adding that as part of reviewing its investment portfolio periodically, it also realised about Rs 3,500 crore through portfolio divestment.In line with its focus on growth and expansion, Tata Steel is expanding its capacity at Kalinganagar from 3 MT to 8 MT. It has also acquired Bhushan Steel forRs 35,200 crore and is one of the final two bidders for Bhushan Power & Steel for which it has reportedly bid Rs 17,000 crore.

Chakraborty was referring to a low level of promoter holding in the company at 33%, which does not make equity dilution a plausible option.Tata Steel’s debt has increased 1.6 times after the Bhushan Steel deal that got completed in May. Its net debt at the end of March was Rs 69,215 crore, according to Bloomberg estimates.Higher borrowing will put pressure on the balance sheet, Chakraborty said. However, in a recent meeting with analysts, the management said it was confident of cash flow generation, assured by better operational performance in Q1 than in Q4. Even though the second quarter of July-September is a weak one with the monsoon setting in, Q3 will again see better realisations with buoyant prices and less volatility in raw material prices.Analysts are of the view that the deconsolidation of the debt of Tata Steel Europe with the proposed Thyssenkrupp-Tata Steel Europe JV will bring down the debt of Tata Steel in India.

FY18 witnessed i) ramping up of Kalinganagar (Table 2) ii) largest rights issuance for the company since Tata Steel Europe acquisition, which helped Net debt to reduce below Rs 700bn iii) Start of the process of acquisition of Bhushan Steel under IBC 2016 and iv) Significant restructuring in the European business with Memorandum of Understanding with hyssenKrupp to form 50:50JV; restructuring of British Steel pension scheme with acceptance of 69% of the employees for the new scheme and sale of Hartlepool pipe mills. Large part of the strategic imperatives remain on scheduled course for completion while there has been incremental uncertainty off late regarding timely completion of Thyssen JV.

Nevertheless, there has been a mention of >€20/te compression in European spreads from current levels (citing industry reports).

In a statement on Saturday, Thyssenkrupp called the joint venture with Tata Steel “an important milestone” for the transformation of Thyssenkrupp to an industrial and service group and said it would lead to a significant improvement of its financials. “The JV will have a two-tier management structure with a supervisory board and a management board with equal representation from both partners.” Thyssenkrupp also said due diligence and independent expert opinions have confirmed the economic viability of the new company. An official statement said since the signing of the memorandum of understanding, development in performance of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe and Tata Steel Europe led to a valuation gap between the two entities. “The definitive agreement includes a proper compensation of this valuation gap: In case of an initial public offering (IPO) of the joint venture, Thyssenkrupp will receive a higher share of the proceeds, reflecting an economic ratio of 55:45 in favour of the German company.” The joint venture will issue warrants equivalent to 10% of the equity capital of Thyssenkrupp, subject to certain dilution provisions, which can be monetised through secondary sale in case of an IPO. The warrants would be triggered only when the venture decides to go public. “Thyssenkrupp has performed better than Tata Steel Europe in the past four quarters,” said Ritesh Shah, metals analyst at Investec Securities. “Therefore, on the basis of net present value of future cash flows, the two parties decided to insert the clause of warrants issue that will give Thyssenkrupp a greater share in the JV at the time of the IPO.” The better performance had also made some investors in Thyssenkrupp question the creation of the joint venture.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/thyssenkrupp-ag-tata-steel-finalise-european-steel-joint-venture/articleshow/64803322.cms

2018-07-02,"Amit Dixit, AVP, Edelweiss Securities, tells ET Now that there is an upside of roughly Rs 80 to Rs 85 a share from the current levels and that translates in 15% upside from the deal.Edited excerpts:Given the cyclicality of the business, how are you viewing the Tata Steel-Thyssenkrupp deal? CFO, Kaushik Chatterjee,, said that synergy benefits are going to play out in the next two to three years.Tata Steel’s Netherlands operation is quite profitable. Port Talbot operation is the best of the best cases and has broken even already. Now with the Thyssenkrupp deal coming in, there is another operation of far higher capacity and of greater profitability. When these operations combine, in the long term even if there is little bit of downturn in the steel cycle, your overall operations are more robust so in the past we have seen that when the steel cycle turned unfavourable, Corus made losses or did not contribute that much to EBITDA. With the new deal, even in the European leg, Tata Steel will contribute more because it is much better hedged. Coming to the second question on the synergies, 400 to 500 million euros is what the management has talked about and there are more synergies that can be done through capex rationalisation and working capital rationalisation after two to three years. Procurement which comprises around one-third of the synergies, should start flowing from year one. All in all, from long-term perspective, the deal is quite good for Tata Steel. What could be the upside for the stock based on the fact that even though it is a minor tinkering, it is a tinkering in the structure and could lead to listing of Tata Steel Europe?I will leave the listing of Tata Steel Europe part out because that is still unknown. Let us talk about what is known. From my analysis, I believe that there is an upside of roughly Rs 80 to Rs 85 a share from the current levels and that translates into roughly 15% upside from this particular deal, More importantly just think of it the kind of speculations that were flowing around with activist Elliott Management coming in and the kind of impact it would have. In fact, when the news broke out we found that the stock tempered 7%. These concerns should go away now.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/thysenkrupp-deal-quite-good-for-tata-steel-in-long-term-amit-dixit-edelweiss-securities/articleshow/64822191.cms

2018-07-03,"NEW DELHI: Monday spelt misery for equity investors on Dalal Street. A falling rupee and continuing trade war tensions robbed them of risk-taking appetite and sent the stock market crashing.At close, the S&P BSE Sensex stood at 35,264, down 159 points, while NSE’s Nifty50 took a 57-point tumble to close at 10,657. But some 51 stocks stood apart and an important trend-spotting indicator signalled that they may show an uptrend in the coming sessions.Stocks like Tata Steel, Titan, Kolte-Patil, Graphite India, GM Breweries, JMC Projects and Godrej Industries showed bullish crossovers on the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, charts.Some of these counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.Some other stocks such as Genus Paper & Boards, Kothari Petroche, Arshiya, HEG, Allsec Technologies, Hindusthan National Glass and JMT Auto showed bullish crossovers on the MACD chart, signalling an imminent downturn.MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.The MACD alone may not be sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.The MACD charts also signalled bearish crossovers for 40 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. They included Dewan Housing, Sun Pharma, Granules India, Lupin, SJVN, Rolta India, 8K Miles Software, Can Fin Homes and Uniply Industries.The Nifty50 index on Monday formed a candle similar to the ‘Dark Cloud’ pattern on the daily chart. Even as the session saw buying at lows, the 50-pack may need to move above the 10,740 level in the short term to instil confidence among traders, experts said. As long as the index holds below 10,660, it could slip towards 10,600 and 10,550 levels. On the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,700 and 10,770 levels, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.Understanding MACD A close look at the chart of Titan Company shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

2018-07-03,"Guido Kerkhoff, CFO, Thyssenkrupp, tells ET Now that by merging number two and three in the flat steel sector, a very strong number two behind ArcelorMittal has been created.Edited excerpts: The Tata Steel-Thyssenkrupp deal is the biggest consolidation in the European steel market in more than a decade since the acquisition of Arcelor by Mittal Steel and the buyout of Corus by Tata Steel. How important a milestone would you say this is for Thyssenkrupp?This is indeed an important milestone for Thyssenkrupp. The steel sector and the steel business is the heritage and the starting part of our business overall. Nevertheless, our steel business is already a merger of many steel businesses mainly in Germany. It is Thyssen, it is Krupp, it is companies that merged forces in the past. By merging number two and number three in the flat steel sector, we are creating a really strong and convincing quality leader in steel in Europe and a very strong number two behind ArcelorMittal. We are really looking forward and are excited about it. For Thyssenkrupp overall, it is one additional step in moving further up portfolio development.It took nine months for the deal to proceed from MOU stage to the definite agreement stage. Was the delay caused by pressure from active shareholders?No, not at all. You have to do such a deal in a very diligent manner and to make that happen, we clearly said that before we can move on, we need to consult with all stakeholders involved especially with the unions in all countries. That is why we said we have to address the workforce and we want to have a diligent and sufficient consultation process -- in Germany, Netherlands and UK. All these negotiations took that much time. Nevertheless, diligence and quality are more important than time. We thought this is the right timing and these are the preconditions before signing the deal.The joint venture also issues warrant equivalent to 10% of the total equity of Thyssenkrupp to a potential IPO. What could be the timing of the IPO?Yes, that was to bridge the valuation gap. Even the outside world analysts see the contribution from our side. The gap has widened a little bit over the recent nine months and the warrant that we can have an IPO and therefore get 5% more and so a 55% economic share in it was to reflect this valuation differential.With a warrant, we would have an appropriate measurement on one hand to create a 50-50 joint venture which between Tata and Thyssenkrupp, given the heritage of both companies, is the only way of making this joint venture for the future successful. On the other hand, this will help overcome the issue of the increased valuations gap that we saw developing over the last nine months. Overall an appropriate solution for this situation.This deal has been criticised by the workers’ unions over several months. How did both sides manage to assuage their concerns? What safeguards have been put in place for them? That is why we clearly said at the time of the MOU, that on both sides we equally share the pain, meaning up to 2,000 full time equivalence could be reduced in such a merger. We started the negotiations on both sides very openly to find the right measurements and put them in place. With the unions in Germany we could agree is guarantees for certain sides till 2021 and most of them till 2026. On the other hand, we could clearly define a path with no forced dismissals.. Similar things have been discussed and has been part of the consultation in the Netherlands and in the UK. So, the overall potential up to 4000 FTEs (full time employees) can be realised in a manner as agreed with the union.How important a market is India for you? Does Thyssenkrupp have any expansion plan here?As a steel market, it is not so important for us. We have never exported a lot to India. We just have a very small mill in India which will be part of the joint venture.. For us, India is a much more important market, for our elevator business where we recently launched a new factory and a new facility overall. We are very strong in industrial solutions with engineering capabilities and even for outsourcing and share services, we are strong in India. India is a growing economy and we want to contribute and be part of that.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/for-thyssenkrupp-the-tata-steel-deal-is-one-step-up-in-portfolio-development-guido-kerkhoff/articleshow/64839185.cms

2018-07-12,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel is planning to sell some of its businesses in South-East Asia as part of its strategy to exit non-scalable businesses and turn focus to domestic market, people familiar with the matter said. Tata Steel has appointed a banker in Singapore to scout for buyers for NatSteel Holdings Pte Ltd (Singapore) and Tata Steel Thailand. The steelmaker values the businesses at about $500 million.Both units are suffering due to lack of demand caused by slump in construction activities and elevated scrap prices in Singapore and Thailand. They contributed Rs 9,542 crore, or 16%, to total revenue of Rs 60,519 crore in FY18 but only Rs 437 crore, or 2%, to the total EBITDA of Rs 22,045 crore. Tata Steel’s operations in South-East Asia began in 2004 with the acquisition of NatSteel, Singapore. In 2006, Tata Steel acquired Thailand-based steelmaker Millennium Steel to strengthen its South-East Asian operations.Tata Steel declined to comment. Under new Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Tatat Group is exiting businesses that don’t have potential to either scale up or be immensely profitable. Tata Steel wants to become a top steelmaker in India and Europe, according to its latest annual report.“India is expected to be one of the few large regions with good demand growth. Tata Steel intends to grow through organic and inorganic routes to ensure it remains the leading steel player in attractive segments and also at the overall industry level,” Tata Steel said in the annual report. India contributed 45% to FY18 revenue.Tata Steel is expanding footprint in India. It approved the expansion of the Kalinganagar plant in Odisha to 8 million tonne and has also acquired Bhushan Steel from the bankruptcy court. “Tata Steel is clear in its strategy to focus on India. The margins are far superior in India than any other geography they operate in. Singapore and Thailand have not created value for the business and they can exit these two places to invest the cash in Indian operations,” said a Mumbai-based analysts, who is not authorised to speak to press.The company also dealt with the distressed Europe operations by signing an agreement with ThyssenKrupp AG to form a joint venture to carve out and restructure its structurally weak European operations, which have historically posted substantially low and volatile operating margins.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-plans-to-sell-south-east-asia-operations-to-focus-on-indian-market/articleshow/64967172.cms

2018-07-17,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel is planning to raise as much as $3.1 billion via overseas loans to repay existing high-cost debt ahead of the merger of its European operations with German steel giant Thyssenkrupp.Once completed, this could be one of the largest refinancing programme by a corporate this year to drastically cutdown borrowing costs.The new facilities will replace the existing debt held by its European businesses and the pricing would be done sometime in August, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told ET.The group has begun negotiations with half-a-dozen banks including Barclays, JPMorgan, MUFG, DBS Bank and Citigroup, sources said. Individual banks could not be contacted immediately for comments.Tata Steel did not reply to ET’s emailed query until the publication of this report.“The aim is to replace them before September quarter. This will substantially reduce debt burden on Tata Steel’s consolidated operations. The new debt will be cheaper by 30-40 basis points from the current level,” said one of the sources mentioned above.Tata may raise 2-5 year money, which could be priced after adding a markup or spread over the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), a benchmark gauge.Tata Steel, which has about $8 billion debt under its European operations, has already agreed to transfer two-thirds of the same to the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp. The remaining high-cost debt will be replaced with the new facilities.ET reported on January 18 that Tata Steel is planning a mega loan recast of up to $2.8 billion worth of existing debt to strengthen its balance sheet before its joint venture with German steelmaker Thyssenkrupp takes off.Separately, in January, Tata raised $1.3 billion by selling dollar-denominated bonds to overseas investors.Tata Steel’s deal with Thyssenkrupp triggers a deconsolidation of the European steel business from Tata’s consolidated balance sheet, according to analysts.“In addition, with the transfer of ¤2.5 billion in debt, Tata's balance sheet will improve, with net debt at ~¤6 billion (based on March 2018 financials and without factoring in the Bhushan Steel acquisition),” Morgan Stanley analysts Ashish Jain and Mukund Sarawogi wrote in a note on July 2.“Moreover, the transferred debt will not have recourse to Tata Steel and management expects to service ~¤2 billion in debt (raised in the Singapore entity for European operations) from the dividends received from the JV, further easing the pressure on its domestic balance sheet.”This year companies are shying away from dollar bond market as rising US Treasury yields have helped increase borrowing cost. In the past one year, the US benchmark yield has surged more than 50 basis points.“There is a lot of capital available in loan form from international banks who have interest in India.

2018-07-17,"NEW DELHI: As the domestic equity market turned choppy on Monday after a brief spell of upsurge last week, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 148 counters on NSE.This indicates a high possibility that these stocks may witness a downturn in the days ahead.Key stocks that saw bearish crossovers included PC Jeweller, Jaiprakash Associates, Reliance Com, NCC, Jindal Steel & Power, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Nalco, Reliance Power, Hindalco, Dish TV India and DLF, among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.Monday turned out to be a bad day for the bulls, as a spike in June WPI inflation fanned rate hike fears among investors, restricting them from placing fresh bets. Weak global cues also weighed on investor sentiment.At close, the S&P BSE Sensex stood at 36,324, down 0.60 per cent, while NSE’s Nifty50 slipped below the crucial 11,000 level to close at 10,937, down 82 points or 0.74 per cent.Some of the counters that saw bearish crossover on MACD charts have also been witnessing strong trading volumes recently, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.Other stocks that showed similar tendencies included L&T Finance Holdings, Petronet LNG, IRB Infrastructure, IDFC, Syndicate Bank, Edelweiss Fin. Ser, PTC India, Sun TV Network, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar and Marksans Pharma.The MACD charts also signalled bullish crossovers for 14 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘buy’ signals. They included Bharat Petroleum, Shriram Transport Finance, Arihant Superstructures, Piramal Enterprises and Ashiana Housing, among others. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.The MACD alone may not be a sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.The Nifty50 index on Monday made a formation similar to the Bearish Belt Hold pattern on the daily chart.Should the Nifty50 sustain below 10,930, it may see profit booking and move towards the next support level at 10,879, which is the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 10,557 to 11,078 levels, said Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities.Understanding MACDA close look at the chart of MMTC shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.Shares of the company closed at Rs 31.95 apiece on BSE.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-steel-rpower-hindalco-among-150-stocks-all-set-to-slide-shows-macd/articleshow/65020327.cms

2018-08-14,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel raised its offer for Bhushan Power & Steel to Rs 19,500 crore, making it the highest among the three bids for the bankrupt company as Tata Steel and Liberty House refrained from revising their proposals, two senior officials with knowledge of the matter said.All the three bidders submitted their offers on Monday after the Supreme Court allowed the lenders of Bhushan Power to accept fresh bids.While JSW Steel sweetened its bid that was already revised once, Tata Steel and Liberty House resubmitted their original offers of Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 18,000 crore, respectively, the officials said.JSW Steel had initially offered Rs 11,000 crore in the first round closed on February 8. In the last week of July, in an unsolicited move, it revised the bid to Rs 18,000 crore, soon after the lenders informed Tata Steel that it was the top bidder after the first round.JSW Steel’s latest offer is 77% higher than its original bid. If Bhushan Power’s lenders accept the bid, it will result in a lower haircut.But it will still be less than half the Rs 49,264 crore the company owes to financial creditors. Haircut is the amount that lenders have to forgo to settle a non-performing loan “At a marathon meeting held on Tuesday, lenders reviewed the bids received from the three bidders. The evaluation of the bids and ranking of bids are yet to be done,” said a lender representative who attended the meeting. “Based on the evaluation matrix and the offer received, it appears that JSW Steel could emerge as the highest bidder if the court allows lenders to accept revised offers,” he added.In the first round, JSW Steel was declared the second highest bidder, with lenders disqualifying Liberty House since it failed to provide critical information about funding the takeover of the bankrupt company. After JSW Steel made a revised bid on July 27, lenders decided to give the other two applicants — Tata Steel and Liberty — an opportunity to revise their offers as well. But Tata Steel approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, the appellate court on bankruptcy cases, opposing the lenders move. The NCLAT ordered lenders to accept revised bids and asked them to submit those to the court on August 17. Tata Steel then moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the NCLAT order, but the top court too ruled in favour of lenders accepting revisedbids.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-jsw-liberty-house-submit-bids-for-bhushan-assets/articleshow/65401547.cms

2018-08-27,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel aims to increase the representation of women in its workforce and has set itself a five-year gender-diversity target of 20%, three times more than the national average for manufacturing companies.Currently, 11% of the steelmaker’s employees of 7,000 are women, up from about 8% two years ago and higher than the typical female headcount of 3-8% in the manufacturing sector.The diversity thrust includes focused hiring of women both from campuses and who are experienced, offering female staff facilities like flexible working hours, options to work from home and distant locations, and leadership development programmes.To attract female talent, especially in technical fields, a year ago Tata Steel launched an initiative called ‘Women of Mettle’—a scholarship scheme to induct woman engineers into the manufacturing sector. The programme is open to female students from engineering colleges like IITs and NITs. The top 10 candidates are given pre-placement offers.“There are a lot of women who are willing to take up work in maledominated areas and if we do not realise that now, going forward there will be a lot of difficulty,” said Suresh Tripathi, vice-president of human resources management at Tata Steel.The company has special incentives for hiring partners for every successful female hire. It has annual female recruitment targets to have desired representation across levels.Gender experts said boosting gender diversity would be a mammoth target for a traditional industrial sector company and that it should focus on inclusion drives for a mindset change so that women who come in could be retained for a longer time.The representation of women is poor in India’s traditional industrial sectors—consultancy firm Avtar Career Creators & Flexi Careers India estimates it at 3-8% in the manufacturing sector.One school of thought is against setting a number-based target for gender inclusion, but Saundarya Rajesh, founder of Avtar Career Creators, said numbers provided a great deal of clarity down the organisation.“When number targets are set, the seriousness of the message goes down and everyone gets on to the act,” Rajesh said. And that is precisely what Tata Steel is doing. It has leadership development programmes for junior, middle and senior managers to go to the next level, and speed-mentoring programmes for high-potential women who have taken up leadership roles.“Gender diversity is essential, and not having it can be detrimental to business. A diverse workforce ensures that we have different mindsets dealing with challenges in different ways, and this helps us strategise better,” said Atrayee S Sanyal, its chief diversity officer. Among some other initiatives, the company recently introduced menstrual leave empowerment.This is not additional leave, but empowers women to take 12 days of leave in a year from their sick leave basket without a doctor’s certificate. The company has also started a programme called Take Two, a second career option for women to return to work.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-on-a-gender-diversity-drive-aims-to-have-20-female-staff-in-5-years/articleshow/65568024.cms

2018-09-06,"Tata Steel on Thursday announced a ""ground-breaking"" new sustainable technology which could save half the amount of carbon dioxide released during steel making following tests at its Ijmuiden site in the Netherlands. Its HIsarna technology for producing iron consists of a reactor in which iron ore is injected at the top. The ore is liquefied in a high-temperature cyclone and drips to the bottom of the reactor where powder coal is injected. This significantly reduces the number of energy-intensive steps required for the traditional steelmaking process, the Indian steel major said. ""HIsarna's results show we can make a significant contribution to improving the sustainability of steel production with this Tata Steel technology,"" said Hans Fischer, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Tata Steel's European operations.  ""The development of this technology forges our ambition to become a steel company which is sustainable in all respects,"" he said. The company said that testing has shown this technology can lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from the steel production process. During the final test campaign, experiments were done with the use of steel scrap and biomass. This revealed it was possible to achieve a CO2 reduction of more than 50 per cent.  Tata Steel's HIsarna plant has now become a permanent part of the production chain at the IJmuiden site, with molten iron joining that from the blast furnaces in the steelmaking process. Meanwhile, the design of an industrial scale HIsarna plant capable of making up to 20 times more liquid iron has started. It could be put into operation in seven years, Tata said. The HIsarna technology reduces CO2 emissions and energy consumption through a number of ways, including by using iron ore and pulverised coal without having to pre-process the raw materials in separate coke, sinter or pellet factories. In the past six months, tests have been done with the use of steel scrap in the HIsarna reactor.  This showed that up to 53 per cent of material added to the process could be made of scrap steel, reducing the requirement for raw materials compared to the blast furnace process.  The next steps in testing the HIsarna installation include identifying the ideal raw material mix, investigating the options to recycle steel slag, testing the use of CO2 to inject raw materials, investigating the recovery of zinc and studying the possibilities for capturing and storing CO2 - expected to have the potential of reducing traditional steelmaking CO2emissions by around 80 per cent.  Around EUROS 75 million have reportedly been invested in developing HIsarna, the name being an amalgam of the ancient Celtic word for iron (Isarna) and the name of the melting vessel (Hismelt).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-unveils-sustainable-steel-production-technology-in-europe/articleshow/65706660.cms
2018-09-06,"Tata Steel Thursday submitted before the NCLAT that the lenders of the debt ridden firm Bhushan Power & Steel permitted rival JSW Steel to change the basic parameters of its bids after submission. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing on behalf of Tata Steel, submitted before the appellate tribunal that it was against the interim order passed by NCLAT on August 6. While, Tata Steel following NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) order of the appellate tribunal August 6 order, has filed one additional plan. Passing an order on August 6 order, the NCLAT had allowed all three contenders -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW - to file additional unconditional 'resolution plans' by August 13, 2018, improving their financial offer without compromising the basic parameters of the 'resolution plans' already submitted by them. However, the Committee of Creditors allowed JSW to change basic parameters of its resolution plans. A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya has listed the matter on September 24 for next hearing. In July, NCLAT had vacated its stay and asked the CoC to consider resolution plans submitted by three firms -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel. The tribunal on July 20 gave a go-ahead to the CoC meeting, directing it to finalise a bid for the company. However, JSW Steel revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore ahead of the CoC meeting. Tata Steel put in a bid of Rs 17,000 crore. Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders. Earlier on July 17, the NCLAT had stayed the meeting of CoC when they were going to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder (H1) for BPSL.

2018-09-11,"KOLKATA: Two of India’s largest steel producers Tata Steel and JSW Steel are expected to improve earnings per tonne due to strong domestic consumption, few new capacity additions and higher capacity utilisation driven by consolidation in the sector.This is part of Moody’s Investors Service latest outlook for the Asian steel industry which is tipped to remain stable on the back of steady demand with producers’ profitability expected to improve over the next 12 months.Moody’s conclusions are contained in its just-released report, “Steel-Asia: Earnings Growth on Steady Asian Demand Drives Stable Outlook”.“Profitability, as measured by average earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per tonne for our rated steel companies, will grow slightly over the next 12 months — following a strong improvement in 2017 — underpinned by steady regional demand,” Chris Park, a Moody’s Associate managing director said.Two rated Indian steel producers’ EBITDA per tonne will rise by a midsingle-digit percentage on solid steel consumption, the report said. “With minimal new steel capacity expected to be commissioned until 2021 in India, robust steel demand — especially from the construction, infrastructure and automotive sectors — will keep end-product prices high, even as rising costs for key inputs, coking coal and iron ore, pressure profitability,” it added.Tata Steel’s recent acquisition of 5.6 million tonne producer Bhushan Steel will increase in the company’s steel shipments by over a third. Moody’s expects Tata Steel’s India operations to see a rise in EBITDA per tonne by mid-single-digit over the next 12 months while the company’s backward integration in iron ore and coking coal augurs well in times of rising input prices.JSW’s EBITDA per tonne will also increase by a mid-single digit, with the effect of rising input prices compensated by an increasing proportion of specialty and high-value-added products, and cost reductions. Moody’s also said Indian steel producers have marginal exposure to the US, reducing their indirect exposure since most of their sales are to domestic automotive and manufacturing companies.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/moodys-says-tata-steel-jsw-to-better-earnings-on-strong-local-demand/articleshow/65763533.cms

The transaction, which is Tata Steel's first major acquisition outside the NCLT process where it bagged Bhushan Steel earlier this year, involves Usha Martin's one million tonne specialty steel plant in Jamshedpur that makes alloy based long products. The facility at Jamshedpur also comprises a functional iron ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.In a separate statement Usha Martin said, ""all the employees pertaining to the steel business will be transferred as part of the divestment and the sale proceeds will be applied first to repay existing lenders of Usha Martin.""The deal, which is estimated to get completed in the next 6-9 months will help Tata Steel build capacity in long and value added products used particularly in the automotive segment. It will also help Usha Martin clear debt worth over Rs 3,700 crore. ""The company may acquire the asset itself or use any of its subsidiaries to acquire it at the time of closing,""a Tata Steel statement said.ET had first reported in June that Tata Steel has shown interest in buying the asset along with JSW Steel, Liberty Group and Kalyani Steel after reporting in May that the asset was being put on the block by the company. Vedanta had also shown preliminary interest. This is another asset for which Tata Steel has trumped rival JSW Steel which was also keenly pursuing it to enhance its presence in the east.

The location of the facility in Adityapur, near Jamshedpur, further reinforces our commitment to consolidate our presence in Jharkhand and to its industrialization and growth, he added.This is the first major acquisition outside the NCLT process where it successfully bagged the five million tonne Bhushan Steel in Odisha in April this year. ""Usha Martin's product range enhances our portfolio with a focus on the high end automotive and engineering segment,"" the official said. The alloy steel division of UML with its range of long products, has a significant presence in the automotive segment and gives Tata Steel the opportunity to consolidate its equity in this sector. ""We get customer approved products profile from new segments and an ability to earn cash flows from day one. This is aligned to our long term strategy to grow our long products portfolio,"" he pointed out.In particular, the proximity of the plant to Tata Steel's existing steel works in Jamshedpur , brings in significant synergy in logistics of supply of raw material, especially intermediary steel products.Apart from steel unit and power plants, the deal also includes an operational iron ore mine and a coal block under development, which will help consolidate Tata Steel's presence in the raw material sector in Jharkhand and leverage the company's century-old mining capabilities.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/with-the-usha-martin-steel-plant-acquisition-eye-on-strategic-growth-opportunities-in-india-tata-steel/articleshow/65922903.cms

SBI is the lead banker for the group's debt.The slump sale is a milestone in the six-decade history of the Kolkata-based company and one of the few instances of promoters deleveraging through asset sale.""Though we are encouraged by the Tatas signing an agreement with the current management of Usha Martin, the end use of the funds is opaque,"" Usha Martin founder Basant Jhawar and his son Prashant, who together own 25 per cent stake in the company, said in a statement Monday.But the Jhawars were quick to add that the Tatas' involvement in their steel business will add value to the stakeholders and that the transaction with Tata Steel is overall a positive development.The company is fighting a takeover and management control battle at the NCLT now.""As 25 per cent shareholders, we are concerned about the liabilities which will fall on the residual business and its capacity to service the same. No details are available.""How much of the term loans, working capital, liabilities to unsecured creditors and other liabilities will be cleared and how much will be carried forward with the burden falling on residual business is very opaque.""This has created doubts over the transparency and the management accountability.

2018-09-25,"Tata Steel’s likely acquisition of Usha Martin’s steel operations on a slump sale basis for Rs 4,300-4,700 crore is small, yet a good one. The buyout that includes Usha Martin’s captive iron ore mine and a power plant marginally increases debt on Tata Steel’s already leveraged balance sheet, but offers significant scope for earnings improvement.Usha Martin’s EBIDTA per tonne in FY18 was around Rs 5,500. Peers with a similar set-up make much higher profits. For instance, EBIDTA per tonne for Jindal Steel & Power is Rs 10,600. This means that after the buyout by Tata Steel, Usha Martin’s steel division profits could improve sharply.The acquisition of a million tonnes of steel capacity would include a captive 2.5 mtpa iron ore mine, which is 160 km away from the steel plant, and a 155-MW captive power plant. The company also has a coal mine that it won in the 2015 auctions. Analysts attribute low profitability to existing operational inefficiencies, and estimate an earnings upgrade in the next 18 to 24 months. The transaction could take 6 to 9 months.At Rs 4,500 crore, the transaction can be valued at 6 to 6.5 EV by potential EBIDTA. Enterprise value is the market capitalization plus net debt. This would increase the net debt (from FY18 end) by 6 per cent, a limited impact for the Tatas. But once the earnings are upgraded, the acquired asset will be able to meet its own debt obligations.For Tata Steel shareholders, the acquisitions of 1 mtpa steel capacity remains largely insignificant when compared with the overall size of the company. Tata Steel’s Indian capacity is 13 mtpa, which it plans to increase to 18 mtpa through expansion. What will be more important is the outcome on the Bhushan Power and Steel bidding, where Tata Steel is competing with JSW Steel and Liberty House.This will decide the extent of leverage the company is willing to take. Its consolidated net debt (Rs 72,000 crore) to EBIDTA (Rs 21,890 crore) in FY18 was 3.3 and is expected to increase to 3.6. This is in the positive phase of the cycle. Bhushan’s acquisition could take the net debt to Rs 1.1 lakh crore and that may be considered a stretch by a section of the investors. On Monday, Tata Steel’s stock fell 2.8 per cent to Rs 607.7.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/usha-martin-buy-can-push-up-earnings-of-tata-steel/articleshow/65943802.cms

The transaction remains subject to various regulatory approvals and is likely to close over the next six to nine months.Tata Steel will pay a cash consideration of Rs 4300-4700 crore for the asset, which will be funded through a mix of incremental debt and internal accruals.""The acquisition of Usha Martin's steel business, once completed, will strengthen Tata Steel's business profile because it will help Tata Steel to further solidify its geographical footprint in eastern India with its current manufacturing plants located in the same region as Usha Martin's facility,"" the Moody's report said.In addition, the acquisition will also help Tata Steel to further widen its long products offering and increase the proportion of value-added goods in its product mix. The captive raw material sourcing at Usha Martin's steel operations will supplement Tata Steel's existing business, which is also largely vertically integrated, thus alleviating any concerns about raw material sourcing as it continues to expand its production capacity both organically and inorganically, Moody's said.""We expect strong demand fundamentals in India and lack of incremental new capacity to result in market share gains for Tata Steel,"" the global ratings agency said.""Tata Steel's announcement to acquire Usha Martin's steel business, which will subsequently be rebranded under the “Tata” group, will help the company to increase its domestic shipments, thereby enabling it to capture a larger share of the domestic demand and increase its domestic market share,"" Moody's said.Steel demand in India is likely to remain robust and continue to grow in mid-single digits supported by strong consumption in the infrastructure, automobile and capital goods segment, the report said, adding, it does not expect any significant steel capacity to be commissioned in India until 2021.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/proposed-acquisition-of-usha-martin-credit-positive-for-tata-steel-moodys/articleshow/65953188.cms

2018-10-10,"MUMBAI: Sunil Bhaskaran, a Tata Steel veteran, has been selected as the new chief executive and managing director at Air Asia India, a low-cost airline jointly owned by Tata Group and AirAsia Berhad of Malaysia. “With India’s aviation sector growing at a rapid pace, we are confident his extensive experience, ability to drive performance and work seamlessly with all stakeholders will be a great asset for AirAsia India,” S Ramadorai, chairman at AirAsia India, said in a late evening statement.Bhaskaran is currently the vice president corporate services at Tata Steel, based in Jamshedpur. He is also the chairman of the board at Jusco and Jamshedpur Football Club. He takes charge from November 15.He did not respond to messages, seeking a comment.ET broke the story of Bhaskaran’s appointment on its website hours before the formal announcement on Tuesday evening.An industry insider who told ET about the development also said there is a possibility that even chairman Ramadorai could step down soon and replaced with Banmali Agrawala, president, infrastructure, defence and aerospace, at Tata Sons. Ramadorai and AirAsia India's non-executive director R Venkataramanan are likely to have sold their collectively owned 2% stake in the airline to Tata Sons, the person said on condition of anonymity. If that has happened then Tata Sons now owns a majority 51% stake in the four-year-old airline with the rest 49% owned by its Malaysian partner.Additionally, AirAsia Berhad deputy group CEO Bo Lingam has stepped down from the Indian carrier’s board. CEO Tony Fernandes is stepping down too, said the person in the know.When contacted, a spokesperson for AirAsia India said she had “no updates to share” either on Ramadorai's plans, the change in shareholding or the changes in the board.AirAsia India has been without a chief executive since June when Amar Abrol quit citing personal reasons. The airline had identified JetBlue executive Eash Sundaram to take up the role, but he didn’t accept the offer. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran is believed to have handpicked Bhaskaran to lead the troubled airline a few weeks back after months of searching for a new CEO. Bhaskaran completed his BTech from IIT Delhi in 1985, followed by a post-graduation in Management from IIM, Kolkata in 1987. He joined Tata Steel in 1987 and subsequently completed his GMP from Cedep at INSEAD, France in 2000.“Sunil has been working closely with the government and that would come handy in a regulated sector like aviation that is facing tremendous headwinds at the moment,” an old associate said on condition of anonymity. “But with the sector and the airline facing massive turbulence, he will have his hands full.”AirAsia India has come under heavy weather after ousted Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry alleged that fraudulent transactions amounting to Rs 22 crore were carried out in AirAsia India. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is investigating allegations that AirAsia Group chief executive Tony Fernandes and other executives bribed government officials to amend the 5/20 rule that mandated that Indian airlines must have five years of experience and a minimum of 20 aircraft to fly on international routes. CBI has alleged that payments of about Rs 12.28 crore were remitted to India to lobby with civil servants during the UPA rule, and booked Fernandes and others for bribing unnamed government officials to obtain a flying permit for the airline. There are internal challenges as well. AirAsia India is said to be flying “radarless for months”, as a company executive put it on condition of anonymity. The only top management executive who was there to steer the airline for months was its finance chief Deepak Mahendra, former Tata Power executive. AirAsia India recently appointed Rajkumar Paranthaman as its head of marketing, but several other key positions like that of a chief commercial officer lie vacant.AirAsia India's net loss widened 2.6 times year on year at Rs 61.8 crore for the quarter ended June, while its revenue jumped 86% to Rs 650 crore, according to its airline parent's filing in the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange. Its number of flights increased by 87% on year during the quarter as its fleet size grew to 18. But its number of passengers grew only 82%, impacting margins for the airline. Figures from India's aviation regulator the Directorate General of Civil Aviation showed that AirAsia India's market share was 4.7% in August, a steady fall from the peak 5.5% share it had reached in May. Expansion is being done at a snail's pace and plans to start international operations have to be on hold as the CBI investigations are on. Ironically, the core of the controversy surrounding the carrier is the AirAsia Berhad CEO’s relentless and allegedly irregular lobbying for a relaxation in rules to fly overseas.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/et-exclusive-tata-steel-veteran-sunil-bhaskaran-to-be-new-air-asia-india-boss/articleshow/66146401.cms

These include tripartite agreements between Indian and global capital goods firms and steel companies for assured offtake, he said.The steel ministry is organising a conference on October 23 in Bhubneshwar to facilitate talks between foreign suppliers with Indian manufacturers to float joint ventures in India. The ministry will also consider fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to promote local equipment manufacturing for steel plants.The foreign manufacturers are from eight countries -- Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, China and Japan. Well known world renowned steel technology companies such as Paul Wurth, Danieli Corus, SMS, CEC, Metso, Saralle, Acre and Kawasaki, are involved in MoU signing. However, in all 12 countries are being represented at the conference, said a press statement.ET was the first to report on Sep 27 that global steel plant equipment makers including Primetals Technologies, Nippon Steel, Paul Wurth, Danieli Corus and Thyssenkrupp are expected to hold negotiations in October with domestic firms like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, HEC, Jindal Steel & Power Ltd and Larsen & Toubro to set up manufacturing facilities in India.The move is aimed at enhancement of domestic capacity in capital goods manufacturing for the steel sector and promote the Make in India initiative. The ministry will also assist talks between the capital goods firms and steel firms to ensure adequate order flows to the proposed joint ventures, Singh said.The estimated import of plant and equipment for reaching 300 million tonnes steel capacity is around $25 billion. Further for meeting the spares requirement, it is estimated that the country will have to spend about $500 million annually for import of proprietary and other spares.The National Steel Policy 2017 envisages creation of 300 million tonnes of steel capacity in the country by 2030-31 at an investment of upto $128 billion dollars in primary and secondary steel sectors. The expected capacity creation in the steel sector would involve at least 15-20% investment in plant and machinery.India contributes to about 6% of the global steel production and is set to become the second largest producers of steel in the world.

In the case of Electrosteel we had bid and didn't get it but we respected that decision,"" he added.Earlier this month, more than two thirds of Bhushan Power lenders voted in favour of a revised offer by JSW Steel.When asked whether he was disappointed with the turn of events, Narendran said:""It is not over yet."" Responding to a query on whether Tata Steel would still be interested in acquiring the company, he said "".(yes)..but at the price we had bid.""Tata Steel had put in a bid of Rs 17,000 crore for Bhushan Power ahead of JSW Steel which bid 11,000 crore. Following this, the CoC declared Tata Steel as the highest bidder. However, JSW Steel put in a revised bid of Rs 18,000 crore. Tatas too put in revised bid.Liberty House entered the fray and put a bid for Rs 18,000 crore. Even as the Tatas challenged it, JSW Steel jumped back into the fray with a much improved offer of Rs 19,500 crore. On receiving JSW Steel offer lenders decided to invite all three applicants to submit a revised bid. In response to this, Tata's moved the NCLAT -National Company Law Appelate Tribunal - which permitted lenders to accept revised bids. Tata's moved the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order, who also refused to stay the order.Bhushan Power faces claims of nearly Rs 49,200 crore from financial creditors.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/the-auction-process-for-debt-ridden-bhushan-power-has-been-compromised-tata-steel/articleshow/66365294.cms
2018-10-26,"NEW DELHI: Tata Steel will subscribe to the Rs 1,800-crore rights issue floated by Tata Sponge to fund the proposed acquisition of the specialty steel business of Usha Martin, said a senior executive.The rights issue will be part of the fundraising plan for the acquisition, which is pegged at about Rs 4,700 crore. The plan will include debt of up to Rs 2,500 crore and the issue of non-convertible debentures of up to Rs 1,000 crore.“There will be a rights issue to support this kind of expansion and we (Tata Steel) will certainly subscribe to it,” Tata Steel’s global CEO TV Narendran told media persons at the International Steel Association Conclave in Delhi on Thursday.The development comes at a time when the steel sector is witnessing an upcycle and prices are peaking.On Thursday, the board of JSW Steel also approved a Rs 5,000-crore rights issue to back the company’s organic and inorganic growth.Tata Steel is a promoter shareholder of Tata Sponge Iron and holds 54.5 per cent in the company’s share capital.

He also said that he has supported the move despite his earlier concerns of fund diversion also remaining unaddressed.""We are confident that TSIL will run the assets in the way they deserve to be administered and enhance the legacy,"" Jhawar said in a statement.“We had earlier welcomed the possible involvement of the Tatas in the management of Usha Martin’s Steel Division resulting in value for all stakeholders. In order to facilitate this, we have instructed our lawyers to support the resolution for the sale of the steel division of Usha Martin to the Tata Sponge Iron Ltd (TSIL), at the forthcoming Shareholders meeting,"" Jhawar said. His decision has also been conveyed to the lead banker of the company, State Bank of India (SBI).Jhawar was ousted as the non-executive chairman of the company last year after eight directors of the company observed that his interests were not aligned with the interests of the company. He along with father and founder of Usha Martin Basant Jhawar (also ousted as chairman emeritus) still sit on the board and hold 25.5% stake in the company's shareholding.Jhawar is concerned that contingent liabilities amounting to around Rs 860 crore that include claims from the state government of Jharkhand pertain to irregularities in the mining operations allegedly carried out by the present management led by MD and cousin Rajeev Jhawar. ""We believe, should such claims require settlement it may result in additional debt being loaded on to the residual business. It would be in the best interest of all stakeholders, if the management and the board come out with specific plans to find a resolution,"" Jhawar said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/basant-prashant-jhawar-to-back-usha-martin-sale-to-tata-steel/articleshow/66414840.cms

2018-11-14,"Multiple members of the team and multiple parts of the company came together to deliver a strong performance, TV         Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:What aided the strong domestic demand? Could you give us some triggers and propellers of this growth? Did weaker rupee cause imports to become less attractive this time?It certainly did. When we finished with first quarter, our guidance was that the prices would probably be about Rs 500 lower in the second quarter because the monsoon quarter typically is weak. But the demand was better than we thought. The stocks in the system were lower than we thought and the rupee certainly helped. Demand was quite stable for most of the quarter and it started dropping a bit towards the end of the quarter, by which time the rupee depreciated as well. That allowed us some comfort in the domestic market and we were not flooded with imports. The international prices are maybe $30-40 less than what it was three months back but we do not see a flood of imports because even at these prices, the domestic prices are quite competitive. In India, the prices went up by Rs 500 for us on an average for Q2 versus Q1 and we kept our cost under control. The volumes picked up as well because we had greater production stability. Bhushan also had a decent quarter. Overall, it has been a good effort by the team. Multiple members of the team and multiple parts of the company came together to deliver a strong performance. While the prices were okay in the quarter gone by, internationally the prices have dipped October onwards. Where do you see steel prices move going forward?We have had a Rs 3,500-crore impact on the debt because of the translation of our overseas debt. It does impact us in raw material prices in terms of the coking coal that we buy. We buy 70% of our coking coal from overseas. So it does have impact. But overall, from Tata Steel perspective, a weaker rupee is net positive for us because it gives us stability in the market by allowing us to absorb the increased cost of coal. Net-net, we typically are better off in a weaker rupee environment. It also makes us competitive in dollar terms. This is exactly what happened to Russia three-four years back when the ruble dropped significantly. The Russian steel-makers became very competitive because most of their cost were ruble cost and converted into dollars, it looked good. In India, when the rupee depreciates, a lot of our rupee costs look good in dollars and that helps the competitiveness of the industry.Bhushan Steel contributed well to the overall numbers. Have the inefficiencies in the plant been weeded out? Will you still be able to add on to synergies coming from that acquisition?The gap would be bridged fully because the standalone India numbers, if you take out Bhushan Steel, is at Rs 19,000 crore. It is also helped by the fact that for Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar, 100% of the iron ore is our own iron ore and 30% of the coal is our own coal. As far as Bhushan Steel is concerned, hardly any iron ore is our own iron ore. In fact, we have just started some supplies to Bhushan Steel but we do not have so much iron ore to take care of all of Bhushan Steel’s needs. Also the coal is 100% bought. It is a very different dynamic for Bhushan Steel. Our first objective is to see that the Bhushan Steel EBITDA matches the EBITDA delivered by some of our peers in the industry who also buy raw materials and then to see how we can improve on that because there is a lot of work going on in the synergy side. Bhushan Steel will derive the benefit of plugging into Tata Steel’s global coal procurement. It will also derive benefit from cross benchmarking with the Tata Steel plants and improving the KPIs of most of the facilities. A number of initiatives are taking place on the procurement side, operations side, maintenance side as well as the marketing and sales side. These will help us improve on the Bhushan Steel numbers but it will certainly not match what has been achieved by Tata Steel in Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar.You have also acquired Usha Martin which is a big boost to your long products portfolio. What is the logic of acquiring it via Tata Sponge?Today, we have three big sites in Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Angul (a Bhushan Steel site). with these three sites. we have the potential to grow our flat products business which typically is an integrated steel plant kind of structure and with these three sites, the land that we have in these sites if we have the appetite and the capital can certainly build about 30-35 million tons of capacity.In long products, the growth can come through a different model. It could be a distributed production model. There is a different cost structure for long products businesses as compared to flat products businesses. It does not necessarily have to be integrated steel plants and you can have far more optimal use of land in terms of smaller facilities distributed closer to markets. The whole configuration of long products could be very different and that is why we decided that our long products’ ambitions are better fulfilled through some of our subsidiary companies. Tata Sponge was already looking at going downstream into long products and we said instead of building new capacities, we can use Tata Sponge as a vehicle to acquire Usha Martin. This could be the nucleus of emerging long products business for Tata Steel where we will look at other long products’ assets which may come in our line of sight and develop a structure which is slightly different from the Tata Steel flat products structure. That was the strategic logic of doing it through Usha Martin which obviously would need support. The Usha Martin board is discussing it and they have already mentioned that there will probably be a rights issue and Tata Steel will be very supportive of that.With your ThyssenKrupp JV coming under the EU radar, how would you convince them that it is not against the merger regulation and is competitive in nature? We expected them to do that and that is a process in Europe which we have to follow. We went through phase one where we have put in our submissions and we were expecting that it would go to phase two which is what has happened. The EU has asked us some questions on packaging steels because between ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel in Europe, we became fairly strong in packaging steels. The EU has asked us some questions on electrical steels and automotive steels. We will be addressing the concerns. We will support them in the investigations and they have given themselves 90 working days and we will go through the process.Fundamentally, our argument is that in today’s day and age, when you have fairly open markets and material flowing everywhere, you need to be structurally strong in whichever geography you are in. In India, we are privileged to be structurally strong and we can grow and take care of ourselves but in Europe, the industry is operating in a mature market. The demand is not growing and there needs to be greater structural strength in the European industry.

2018-11-15,"MUMBAI: India’s top steelmakers Tata Steel and JSW Steel are unfazed by the entry of the world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal into India after creditors shortlisted the latter as the preferred bidder for the 10-million-tonne Essar Steel.“It is a globally traded commodity and there are several players in the (global) market. There is 1.6 billion tonnes of steel, which is sold and produced in the world,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel and with that kind of volumes produced, it is very difficult for one or two steelmakers to influence a rival’s margins, he added. “Also, look at the diversity of the export market, the company you talked about (Arcelor-Mittal), we compete with them in the marketplace. At the same place where they are a bigger player, we are selling in those markets,” Rao added.Separately, JSW and Tata Steel are rejigging their acquisition strategy to diversify their product offerings.“There is enough for everybody,” Rao said on Tuesday at a press briefing. Rao reasoned that the current domestic demand stands at 91 million tonnes and is growing at a rate of 7-8% and the demand for this year will reach about 98 million tonnes and JSW Steel is supplying 16 MT out of this total demand.“Steel industry is the most fragmented industry,” he said.“Healthy competition is good for us because if you look at the competition earlier, certain people or certain companies, which were stressed, were at times forced to sell materials at lower prices to get in cash flows, whereas with healthy competitors that problem will be eliminated to some extent. So, you actually see this space becoming more mature from a competition perspective,” said Jayant Acharya, director for commercial and marketing, JSW Steel.Tata Steel that trumped JSW Steel as India’s largest steelmaker after buying Bhushan Steel echoed Rao.“The Indian industry will benefit from world-class players coming in,” TV Narendran, global CEO at Tata Steel, told media on Tuesday at a meet held to announce the company’s second quarterly earnings.“From a Tata Steel perspective, we are confident that we have enough equity in the domestic market and we have the technology and the product lines and people and relationships that we require. We also, anyway, compete with ArcelorMittal and everyone else in Europe and are very familiar with the nature of competition,” Narendran said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-jsw-confident-of-competing-with-arcelormittal-in-india/articleshow/66630526.cms
2018-11-16,"Tata Steel is focused on integrating Bhushan Steel into the Tata fold, TV Narendran, global CEO & MD of the company, told ET’s Rakhi Mazumdar in an interview. He also dwelt on the company’s plans on distributed manufacturing to produce steel and prune its high debt burden post-merger with Thyssenkrupp in Europe. Edited excerpts:Tata Steel’s Q2 results have been good. How much has Bhushan Steel contributed to it?It is the first full quarter for Bhushan Steel, post acquisition. As a first step, we had set a target of reaching an Ebitda level of Rs 10,000 per tonne and we have managed to achieve it. BSL had an Ebitda of Rs 10,200 / tonne in Q2FY19. In the first quarter, Bhushan was with us for only 45 days since acquisition on May 18 this year, and the Ebitda figures were quite low. Tata Steel had an Ebitda of Rs 16,000 in Q1which improved to Rs 19,000 in Q2.What were the major drivers?July-September is a weak quarter (due to monsoon). But demand was not bad, sales volume picked up quarter-on-quarter, and prices remained strong. The rupee devaluation by up to 10% led to a $30-40 fall in global prices. Thus, there were no major imports and this too helped us.What is the next milestone for Bhushan Steel?Bhushan Steel will have to achieve an Ebitda of Rs 12,000/ tonne in 2 years at a 5 million tonne (mt) capacity. It has to benchmark its operating parameters against players such as JSW and JSPL which also do not have captive raw material resources. We will support it to achieve these milestones.What steps are you taking to turn it around?Bhushan Steel is getting plugged into the larger Tata Steel ecosystem. We have taken up initiatives across operations — procurement, maintenance and sales and marketing at Bhushan. A team of 80 people from Tata Steel specifically chosen for the jobs is working with the local team to execute these plans. Internally, we call it Project Be 1which refers to our aim to make it No. 1. During the IBC process, Bhushan Steel was codenamed ‘B 1’, and this acronym took after it.Can you share some examples?When we did the due diligence for Bhushan Steel, we knew exactly which areas needed support. BCG has been working with us and they are involved in Bhushan too. Ideas and targets are set through workshops. There are various projects under Be 1. For example, in maintenance, we have made sure adequate spares are available. There was underspend in this area because of cash crunch, but it is important to ensure greater reliability when you are pushing the facilities. We have unlocked cash too since Bhushan was selling on credit and getting supplies in cash, but now this has been reversed. On the procurement side, we used to buy 15 mt coal, but now we are buying 20 mt. Bhushan is getting nearly $5-6 benefit per tonne. We found that Bhushan's DRI kilns work best with South African thermal coal, so we are getting it. We have already repaid Rs 1,000 crore of debt and will pay back another Rs 1,500 crore.Why did you not bid for Essar Steel?We had looked at Essar, and I also visited the plant. We realised that it requires more capital investment than Bhushan Steel. Our strategy was driven by the need to monetise our iron ore assets better.Tata Steel units are concentrated in the east, but the market is growing in the west and south. How do you see this?We have managed to establish a flat products base between Tata Steel facilities in Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Bhushan Steel unit in Odisha. These value-added flat products can travel. Tata Steel is now working towards a long products strategy that will essentially depend on distributed manufacturing. Our proposed acquisition of Usha Martin steel unit through Tata Sponge is part of this plan. Wehave already set up a scrap collection centre near Delhi. We will have similar centres in other regions as well. We will establish manufacturing units within a 300-km radius of our customers where we will produce steel using scrap. This will be Green steel and it will help reduce our carbon footprints substantially.Tata Steel is carrying a sizeable debt. How do you plan to reduce it?Our debt is at Rs 1.04 lakh crore. When the JV with Thyssenkrupp comes through, some 2.5 bilion euros worth of debt will be taken care of. We want to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 3; we are now at 3.5. Provided the steel market remains strong and depending on cash flows, we hope to reduce our debt to about Rs 60,000 crore.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/working-on-distributed-manufacturing-to-cut-debt-says-tata-steel-global-ceo/articleshow/66645094.cms

2018-11-19,"JM Financial has a buy call on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 745.The current market price of Tata Steel is Rs 581.60.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Tata Steel price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerage:Robust performance at Indian operations: Tata Steel India reported a revenue growth of c.9.1 per cent QoQ, driven by a) 6.8 per cent YoY increase in volumes and b) c.2.2 per cent YoY increase in realisations. EBITDA came in at Rs 60bn (+18.2 per cent QoQ), significantly higher vs. JMfe of Rs 52.7bn, primarily driven higher blended realisation. Blended EBITDA/t increased from Rs 17.1k/t in 1QFY19 to Rs 18.9k/t in 2QFY19.Muted performance at Corus driven by higher costs: Corus EBITDA per ton came in at USD 70/ton in 2Q as against JMfe expectation of USD 76/ton driven by higher costs. EBITDA declined 36.2 per cent QoQ to USD 159mn, primarily driven by higher raw material and energy costs.South East Asia operations benefit from improved realisations: South East Asian operations reported a 14 per cent QoQ revenue growth, driven by improved deliveries at Nat steel and better realisations at both Nat Steel and Tata Steel Thailand. EBITDA remained flat QoQ at Rs 1.1bn in 2Q.Bhushan steel continues margin expansion: Bhushan steel earlier reported a revenue growth of c.26.8 per cent YoY to Rs 58.6bn in 2QFY19, driven by 34.1 per cent increase in volume, partially offset by 5.5 per cent decline in realisation. Volumes benefited from improved marketing strategy which aided in inventory reduction. EBITDA increased 42 per cent QoQ to Rs 11.8bn. EBITDA/t increased from Rs 9.7k/t in 1QFY19 to Rs 10.3k/t in 2QFY19. Tata Steel expects full synergy to kick in once Bhushan steel achieves production of 5mtpa in 24 months.Organic/inorganic growth strategies on track: In Jun’18, Tata Steel and thyssenkrupp AG signed definitive agreements to form a 50:50 JV in Europe. The expansion plan of 5mn tons of capacity at Kalinganagar is on track with an estimated project cost of Rs 235bn, including Rs 160bn up to HRC stage. Tata steel also signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of steel business of Usha Martin via its subsidiary Tata Sponge Iron. The acquisition is expected to complete in 4QFY19.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-tata-steel-target-rs-745-jm-financial/articleshow/66689011.cms
2018-11-21,"As far as its impact on India is concerned, I am hearing of import parcels being booked into India, TV Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:Has the slowdown in China’s economy impacted Tata Steel?The concern about China maybe a bit overstated at times, but there is still a concern. From a macroeconomic point of view, China is growing quite well at 6.5%. What has slowed down a bit is the automobile growth in China. Growth in appliances has also slowed down but the growth in the real estate market is still quite strong. Hence, you are seeing the impact more on flat products which are dependent on automobiles and appliances than in long products which are dependent on construction. So, there has been a little bit of unwinding of positions in China and there is also lot of speculation going on about the cuts in China. There is a view that the cuts announced by the government is less than what people had anticipated. We have seen the flat product prices soften by about $30-40 in the Southeast Asian markets. As far as its impact on India is concerned, I am hearing of import parcels being booked into India. It is not because the domestic prices always are a bit on the higher side compared to the imported landed prices, because when you import you run the risk of having materials come in two, three months after you have booked, unlike in domestic where you get it immediately. So, that is playing out.As of now, the imports in December are forecast to be about 600,000 to 700,000 tons. There will be some sort of impact in the domestic markets, but I am positive that given the fundamentals of the Indian economy, the prices will stay up. It is our job to make sure we get the best prices that we can.Tell me a bit about pricing. Where is the power? Which sections attract more premium? The long product prices have been more stable than the flat products and long products depend a lot on the infrastructure activity. A lot of spending continues in the infrastructure space and we believe that a lot of it will happen as a prelude to the elections, when a lot of activity will happen there. In terms of flat products, India is different from the international markets because auto demand in India is still quite strong. For Tata Steel, our strongest franchise is a B2C business which is 20% of our revenues where we really sell through our distribution network and reach out to individual customers who buy Tata steel because they trust Tata Steel.They are not customers who are looking at the international price. They are consumers who want three to five tons of steel and they are happy to pay a premium for Tata steel because they trust Tata Steel. The other big franchise for us is the automotive franchise which is about 20% of our revenue, where quality is more important than anything else. It is not about what is the cheapest steel available but who amongst the quality producers can give me the best price? You are competing with three or four people in India and globally and an auto company typically looks for stability of supplies and quality. These are two of our strongest franchises and account for 40% of our revenues. Another 10-15% of our revenue comes from our downstream business which is value added products and services. That again is reasonably stable. That is why Tata Steel tends to have numbers which has more stability than some of our peers because we have fairly strong franchises in these areas and also the fact that we are able to sell most of our volumes in the domestic market indicates the equity that we enjoy with our customers.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/given-the-fundamentals-of-indian-economy-steel-prices-will-stay-up-tv-narendran-tata-steel/articleshow/66734509.cms

2018-11-29,"Moody's has said consolidation in the steel sector and solid demand for steel will support the robust profitability of Tata Steel and JSW Steel. The global ratings agency said demand outlook in 2019 is likely to remain similar to 2018. While profitability may vary according to country and region, most Asian steelmakers are likely to see healthy profitability despite softening demand, it said in its latest report, ‘Steel- Asia: 2019 Outlook.’Tata Steel acquired Bhushan Steel now renamed Tata Steel BSL as part of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution process while JSW Steel has acquired Monnet Ispat. Earlier, the two debt-ridden companies Bhushan and Monnet were admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal and put up for auction.""In 2019, demand for steel in Asia will likely stay at levels similar to that in 2018, indicating a softening from the robust growth seen in 2018,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's vice president said. ""As for profitability, rated Asian steelmakers will see their profitability levels weaken mildly because of a decline in Chinese demand growth but stay strong overall.""The profitability is underpinned by robust demand in South and Southeast Asia, as well as China's capacity cuts and strict environment protection measures, according to the report. Moody's also said its forecast on flat steel demand in China reflects higher infrastructure spending that will limit the negative effects of the ongoing US-China trade dispute and slower growth in China’s real-estate investments. The Chinese steel industry drives the outlook for the sector in Asia because China is by far the region's largest steel customer and producer.Moody’s also pointed out escalation of trade disputes will have a limited effect on Asian steel demand, given the moderate indirect impact through supply chains. However, the spill-over impact could be greater, Moody's cautioned, adding that potential US tariffs on imported vehicles pose key downside risks to Japanese and Korean steelmakers.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/robust-profitability-likely-for-tata-steel-and-jsw-steel-moodys/articleshow/66861964.cms

The company also said it is planning to add new materials like Graphene, Carbon fibre reinforced polymer and Advanced ceramics that would constitute over 10% of its revenue by 2025.Tata Steel stated this in a presentation made to investors on November 29. It also said services and solutions would generate around 20% of its revenues by 2025. Tata Steel’s generated 69% of revenues through enriched and value added product mix in H1FY19. The company is targeting a total capacity of 30 million tonne by 2025.Koushk Chatterjee, CFO, Tata Steel said the company’s acquisition of Bhushan steel and Usha Marin was a step towards adding more value added steels in its portfolio. This will be reinforced by deploying more capital in value added downstream assets and venture. It would also pursue a plan of divestment, strategic restructuring and monetisation of non-synergistic ventures, he added.The company said it has raised Rs 19,400 crore in last seven years through divestments that will be used to deleverage its balance sheet. It is also looking at other portfolio restructuring options that includes Tata-Thyssen joint venture in Europe, the Sedibeng iron ore property in South Africa, Cogent, its electrical steels plant at Newport in the UK, TRL Krosaki, a refractory unit in Belpahar, Odisha and the South East Asia cluster.Tata Steel has emerged as the most integrated steel producer with a current steel-making capacity of 18.6 million tonne in FY19. While it has 100% iron ore security till 2030, the company said it can rely on captive sources for over 25% of its coal requirement.

2018-12-06,"Tata Steel BSL, formerly known as Bhushan Steel, has raised Rs 12,000 crore to refinance a bridge loan, or stop-gap credit facility, availed to fund Tata Steel’s acquisition of the Delhi-based company in the insolvency resolution process.Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are among the five lenders that loaned the refinancing funds, three people familiar with the matter told ET. The move would bring down interest costs and lower the overall cost of debt capital.Axis Bank lent about Rs 7,000 crore, which the bank could sell down to other lenders. HDFC Bank extended about Rs 3,000 crore of credit, while Kotak Mahindra loaned Rs 1,000 crore, said one of the persons cited above.Two Kerala-based banks were also parts of the consortium, advancing Rs 500 crore each.Emails sent to individual banks remained unanswered until the publication of this report.""The overall acquisition of Bhushan Steel of more than Rs 35,000 crore was funded through a mix of internal cash generation, shareholder funding and the balance bridge debt of Rs 16,500 crore raised in the acquisition vehicle. This bridge debt is being termed out now,” Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer, Tata Steel, told ET, confirming the move. “In November, a Rs 12,000-crore facility was contracted in Tata Steel BSL from a syndicate of five banks.”More than Rs 10,000 crore has been drawn from this facility already to retire the bulk of the bridge financing and termed out, Chatterjee said. “There will be no increase in gross debt levels of Tata Steel due to the above financing,"" he added.The loan is likely to have come at a 9.30% rate, with a 12-year maturity period, market sources said.At the beginning of the year, Tata Steel emerged as the successful bidder for stressed alloy maker Bhushan Steel in the bankruptcy process. The company took a bridge loan from a group of six-seven private and foreign lenders.Such loans were priced at 8.70%, with one-year maturity. Going by comparable rates, the latest loan looks cheaper.“The refinancing has proved beneficial in terms of cost as the merged entity backed by the Tata brand is credible enough for creditors,” said a banker with knowledge of the matter.On October 1, Tata Steel decided to rechristen its recently acquired asset, Bhushan Steel, as Tata Steel BSL. Tata Steel has also planned to raise the current production level at Bhushan Steel to four million tonne (mt) by March-end from 3.5 mt now.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/tata-steel-bsl-raises-rs-12000-crore-to-refinance/articleshow/66975312.cms
2018-12-07,"ET Intelligence Group: Shares of JSW Steel and Tata Steel, which have fallen steeply over the past few days, could rebound as prices of Chinese steel begin to harden from recent lows, decreasing the spread between overseas and local rack rates for the alloy and cutting the incentive for imports.Chinese steel prices fell by a fifth from October until November, making imports cheaper than domestic steel prices by nearly Rs 3,000 a tonne. But a pullback in the Chinese steel prices by 5 per cent over the past one week should restore the gap, offering some respite to domestic steel producers in the short term.Furthermore, domestic iron-ore producers, such as NMDC, Serajuddin and Essel Mining, have taken price cuts and that would also help maintain steel margins. Earlier in the week, NMDC took the first price cut of the current fiscal, while the other two major ore producers have already taken two price cuts because of the global iron ore price correction of 15 per cent in the last two months.JSW Steel, which sources iron ore from NMDC and through imports, will be in a more advantageous position. Although Tata Steel has its own captive mines, its earnings have been historically very volatile given its exposure to the European markets through Corus.On Thursday, despite sharp corrections in the broader markets, stocks of the two steel companies held firm. While JSW Steel’s stock closed at 305, 0.3 per cent higher than previous day’s close, Tata Steel’s stock was down by 0.8 per cent, and closed at Rs 511 apiece.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jsw-tata-steel-may-rebound-as-china-steel-prices-recover/articleshow/66979867.cms

Investment rationale by the brokerage:The European Commission (EC) has “stopped the clock” in its in-depth investigation (Phase-II) on the proposed joint venture (JV) between Tata Steel’s (TSL) European operations and ThyssenKrupp’s (TK) Steel Europe division pending certain details from both parties. We believe this is not a cause for concern as: 1) such procedures are commonplace in big transactions like the one in question; and 2) both parties are expected to provide the required documents in “a few days”. While we do not rule out additional pressure on the TSL stock until the investigation resumes, at this stage we do not believe the deal deadline would be missed materially. Maintain ‘BUY’ on TSL with an unchanged target price of Rs 720.EC holds deal investigation: The EC would resume Phase-II investigations on the proposed JV between TSL’s European operations and TK’s Steel Europe division pending certain information. We see this as a routine procedure that both companies are expected to comply with in “a few days”. At its Investor day held recently, TSL mentioned that both parties are engaging in constructive discussion with the EC.Complex transaction- clearances needed in 17 jurisdictions: We understand that the ongoing JV is a complex transaction requiring clearances in 17 jurisdictions. The first approval has been already received in the US on 7 November, 2018, and the work on obtaining clearances is underway in other regions such as Asia, South Africa, and South America, Brazil. However, the EC’s approval is critical as the merger will create the second-largest steel player in Europe.Outlook and valuation- nothing to worry; maintain ‘BUY/SO’: We believe that the investigation is routine and despite the EC being closed on account of holiday from 20 December, 2018 to 7 January, 2019, the deadline for the deal is unlikely to be missed materially.

2018-12-12,"Six months ago, Tata Steel shocked everyone with an aggressive play for Bhushan Steel. A second smaller acquisition followed. ET  travels to ground zero in Odisha and Jharkhand to see whether India’s largest conglomerate has an iron grip in the east.How many times have you seen a $5-billion takeover get wrapped up within 72 hours flat? More importantly, how many times have you seen India’s oldest and largest business conglomerate work and deliver on such a timeline?As you read this, the Tata finance team is busy negotiating with banks to raise $700 million of external commercial borrowings (ECB). This will refinance short-term loans raised to pay off Bhushan’s lenders as part of the Tata ‘fit for future’ programme that aims to bring down $1 billion of leverage in the next 12 months. It has already prepaid Rs 2,000 crore of the Rs 35,200-crore acquisition bill within six months of the takeover – its largest in India in its 111-year history.Tata Steel has executed $60 billion in gross capital raising in 10 years and braved unprecedented upheavals. It went from net debt free in 2005-06 to a jaw-dropping $13-billion leveraged buyout.Then came Corus that haemorrhaged £1 million a day in 2015-16. It ended the year as a £300-million loss and an unsustainable debt-Ebitda ratio of 8x.For the Tatas, this financial management may thus seem inconsequential at first glance, but for outsiders, it certainly shows reinvigorating intent and conviction.Surgical StrikeFrom sweltering May, when the Tatas got the green light to take charge of ailing Bhushan Steel and its three assets — the flagship Odisha plant and downstream units in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh — they moved with stealth. NCLT’s nod came on May 15. By May 18, the Tatas had organised funds and paid off lenders, issued new shares, nominated new directors on the Bhushan Steel board, achieved regulatory approvals and taken management and operational control.That day, while Tata Steel managing director TV Narendran, chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee, sundry executives, lawyers and advisors camped at the Grand Hyatt Hotel adjoining the Bhushan headquarters in Delhi, three operating teams — one for each plant — of close to 35 executives were also on standby near plant sites, ready to take charge. “It was like moving into a new kingdom,” recalls Rajeev Singhal, new managing director of Bhushan Steel.Nothing was left to chance. Chatterjee had even organised two drills — including a mock one at Taj Mansingh a few weeks earlier. “Everyone said it would take a week from the court order to deal closing. We did it in two days,” quips Chatterjee. “We had done meticulous and micro planning. The team literally created memories of the future, planning for any eventuality.”Even then, it remained precarious till the very end. The day of the NCLT judgement coincided with Tata Steel’s annual results call. In the middle of the press conference in Mumbai, Narendran received a text and then a frantic call from his legal counsel, who sensed Bhushan promoter Neeraj Singhal was planning to file for a stay order. He actually did get the case listed for the following day but the judge did not admit it, instead deferring it till the following Monday, which turned out to be too late. “I kept stepping out of the results meet to address this emergency. We then decided to use the slim window of 48 hours to tie up all loose ends and just move in.” As late as May 18 morning, there were last minute anxieties on regulatory clearances. Finally, at 2 pm, all payments were cleared and by 5 pm, Tata employees had moved in and taken charge of all the three units. It was nothing short of a “surgical strike,” as some call it internally.“The precision with which they moved over a weekend was unbelievable and shows a new hunger to get things done,” says a rival chief executive who had also scoped out the target. “Right from the bid that they put in, I have never seen such aggression in the Tatas.” To be clear, there was a Rs 5,700-crore ($800 million approximately) gap between Tata Steel’s winning bid and the second best offer, coming from Sajjan Jindal’s JSW.Home is where Hope is“A very large carrier is finally changing its course,” feels Pinakin Parikh, analyst, JP Morgan. It validates his hypothesis that the company is finally harnessing its recent India punts towards value creation in its profitable home base after three years of derisking its European empire through asset sales, pension settlement and finally, a joint venture with Thyssenkrup.At home, it’s now all about maintaining market share through brownfield expansions and opportunistic M&As to pursue volumes growth.“Cost corrections in Bhushan would drive higher margins,” argues Parikh. So would the singular emphasis on upping the share of value added downstream products to further insulate operations from commodity fluctuations.But it’s fair to say the IBC process couldn’t have come at a better time. “Without them (the acquisitions), we would have struggled. Both Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar (TSK) are running flat out. And the next phase of expansion at TSK will take another three years. Till then, we would have lost market share because demand would have been growing at 8% and we had no incremental volumes to offer,” says Narendran.“There’s a clear opportunity in India; we had not taken advantage of it,” acknowledges group chairman N Chandrasekaran. “So we decided we would go full steam ahead.”  The 3-mtpa Kalinganagar project, its first ever integrated steel plant ground up in a century, was a business lesson learnt the most brutal way, taking 10 years and Rs 25,000 cr to build. But today, with Bhushan and the subsequently small yet strategic bolt-on Usha Martin, the Tatas have reclaimed lost ground in the east.Rebalancing PortfolioFundamentally, though, it underpins a much bigger structural shift playing out through Tata Steel’s painful trek back towards profitability and growth. Back in 2006, Corus gave them 18 mt of annual steel-making scale, of which 10 mt was the UK alone. But it did not have any structural strength. India was exactly the opposite —structurally solid but lacking scale, with only 4 mtpa.Now, Europe has scaled down to 10 mtpa, of which the UK is just 3.5 mtpa.Tata Steel is coming together with 200-year-old German conglomerate Thyssenkrup to create the second-largest European steel company that will control a fourth of the continent’s market for flat steel. “We have finally managed to create a stronger enterprise that can stand on its own feet and is sustainable,” says Narendran.At the same time, the Tatas have achieved scale in India too. By 2025, capacity will be more than doubled to 30 mtpa as Bhushan and Usha Martin are integrated and Kalinganagar cranks up its second phase of expansion. More importantly, 93% of total Tata Steel capacity will be domestic versus a paltry 18% just a decade ago.If this is not doubling down, then what is? “The Tatas had ceded their India leadership position to late entrants such as JSW or JSPL for almost five years. Now, it’s once again a pitched battle,” believes industry veteran Malay Mukherjee, a former ArcelorMittal chief executive.“Kalinganagar coming through has given them that extra confidence,” feels SK Roongta, former SAIL chairman. “Capacity addition through M&As seems a priority.”But such big India bets may also turn out to be risky, along with its concentration in the east that is close to natural resources but away from the market and end users.With newer players such as Vedanta and ArcelorMittal, the oligopolistic nature of the Indian steel industry controlled by JSW, Tata and SAIL is also bound to be disrupted, feels Satish Kumar, head, India research, CIMB.A bull steel cycle has also been predicated on supply cuts in China. “Domestic prices are Rs 5,800 per tonne more than imports from the Black Sea market. It is a matter of time before imported steel starts flowing in,” adds Kumar.That’s where the Bhushan price tag has spooked some. “Valuation at $1,140 per tonne appears rich. We expect 7-10% value dilution,” warns Bhaskar Basu of Jefferies.Tata Steel’s capex has always been higher than operational cash flows and is unlikely to change, reasons Kumar. “Although Bhushan has done well in the second quarter, its unintegrated nature leaves it much more vulnerable to steel price shocks,” he says. For the equity markets, leverage for M&A and expansion in a downcycle is the ideal combination for carnage.And when Chinese export prices have corrected $100 per tonne in just three months, prospects of a downcycle seem real.Geographical diversification may have derisked the company partially. “Essar Steel would have helped in getting a wider product and locational spread. They were already dominant in the east so ideally, a plant on the west coast would have been perfect,” says Mukherjee. He takes international examples from ArcelorMittal US or Thyssenkrup itself to suggest proximity to large auto manufacturers is becoming an absolute necessity, especially for supply of higher grades.The Tatas argue that their distribution model helps cover the entire country. Proximity to the market is addressed by an extensive network of 147 distributors, 12,600 dealers/retailers, six hubs and 14 spokes, as per the company. “We have a 45% share in the auto industry and hardly any of them are in the east,” Narendran points out.The region including South East markets of Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia or Indonesia is a lucrative market. Clusters in India or even Europe help in operational oversight, to build common infrastructure such as pipelines and plants.In retrospect, bailing out on Essar also seems a brilliant tactical call. “Imagine, with all the litigation, they would still have been waiting outside, like ArcelorMittal,” quips the India head of a large global distressed fund.From B1 to BE1But as with Corus, buying is one thing and managing another.As Rajeev Singhal and his now expanded team of 70 Tata Steel executives — on deputation to Bhushan Steel for the next three years— blend in with its 5,000-odd workforce to debottleneck all 10 DRI kilns, revive the CONARC plant or even stabilise the two blast furnaces, over 60 initiatives are been pursued through cost synergies of Rs 1,500 crore, to boost operational efficiency and achieve the nameplate capacity. Value is getting unlocked as combined operations negotiate better rates for raw materials, charter bigger capesized ships or optimise railway freight.“During bidding, the code word for Bhushan was B1. Now, with the asset firmly in the bag, the team wants to ‘BE1.’ One with the Tata group and number one operationally,” quips Narendran.Production has already started improving, while power consumption is continuously reducing.Over 100,000 tonnes of monthly exports have also been channelled back into the domestic market for 7-10% better realisations. Basic grades are being enriched for automotive clients.“Bhushan has always been a great asset, the first to supply skin panels to marquee auto clients like Maruti. Their colour-coated products were also used by GE Appliances, Godrej, Samsung,” recalls Singhal, who dealt with Bhushan as a supplier almost 20 years ago. “Its cash flow problems had crippled it in the last few years. We are now integrating operations so each downstream stage synchronises perfectly with the one before.”His target: Scale up capacity to 5.2 mt and increase Ebitda to more than Rs 5,000 crore per annum over the next 2 years, from the current Rs 3,000 crore.Since value added products constitute 45% of Bhushan’s output, it compliments Tata Steel’s product portfolio with additions while consolidating its grip on auto. Historically, the Tatas focused on original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and Bhushan on ancillaries.Upping the Value CurveThe discipline in costs will improve future margins. But even on its own, the management had initiated an endeavour to insulate earnings from price volatility by decommoditising steel, enriching existing units, focusing on value-added downstream products, services and solutions and diversifying into new materials.“The whole idea is to move products to a differentiated mix, which gives premium over commodity grades. The configuration of Kalinganagar has been to look at emerging sectors such as oil and gas, defence and higher grades of automotive products,” explains Chatterjee.Better plant balance will, in turn, drive cost efficiencies further. “Continuous annealing and galvanised lines in Kalinganagar will further augment downstream capabilities,” feels Amit Dixit of Edelweiss Securities. “Driven by the widest cold rolling mill in India, it has the potential to further improve product mix.”The joint ventures with Bluescope for construction and Nippon Steel for auto are additional efforts to corner this high margin segments as was the 3.5x expansion in tin plate capacity to 500,000 tonnes to capture market growth in the packaging industry. Today, branded products alone generate Rs 18,000 crore or 35% of total sales.The balance sheet too has been bulked up with capital raised from Rs 19,400 crore of divestments of the past seven years or restructuring in Europe and South East Asia to take out sub-scale operations, build financial resilience, support better returns on invested capital and fund newer capital needs.“Instead of the earlier plans to totally exit Europe by retaining 50% in the proposed JV, the company remains in play for any future upside,” claims Chandrasekaran.Things can still go wrong as Tata Steel’s brass looks to further expand by 5.4 mt in Kalinganagar, Bhushan and even Usha Martin, exploiting the land bank. On the back of Usha Martin, incremental focus will be on modular long products for construction that are today only 23% of their domestic capacity. The highly fragmented space is also ripe for consolidation.For the moment, the Tata Steel team is well on track. “Our net debt-Ebitda is now 3.5-3.6. The intent is to first to bring it below 3 and then get it to 2.5 times,” says Narendran.Tata Steel may have been once bitten, but it’s certainly not shy the second time round.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/battle-for-kalinga-tata-steel-tightens-iron-grip-in-the-east/articleshow/67065957.cms

2018-12-18,"As Nifty50 extended its rally into a fifth session on Monday, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled upward crossovers on 121 counters on NSE.The MACD is known for identifying trend reversals. Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Vodafone Idea, Steel Authority of India, Tata Steel, JMT Auto, Linc Pen, TVS Srichakra, Kalyani Steel and GMR Infra.Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes in recent times, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included HUDCO, Balmer Lawrie, Just Dial, Prakash Industries, Gabriel India, Sasken Technologies, Lemon Tree and VST Industries, among others. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience an upward movement, and vice versa. However, the MACD alone may not be enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any such trend. Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.The MACD charts also showed bearish crossovers on 11 counters on NSE, which analysts read as ‘sell’ signals. These counters included Mahindra Logistics, Accelya Kale, APL Apollo Tubes, PI Industries, VIP Industries and Manaksia Steels.On Monday, the 50-share Nifty index ended the session 82.90 points, or 0.77 per cent, higher from its previous close at 10,888.Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking, said, “Since last Tuesday, our market seemed to be in a ‘Santa Rally’ mode. Going by the gap theory, a new leg of the rally in the upward direction should unfold now and Monday’s gap (10844 to 10815) may become a strong support zone. On the upside, the immediate hurdle is around 10,940 and we expect this to get surpassed, taking Nifty towards the 11,000 mark and above. Hence, one should keep trading with a positive bias as long as Nifty remains above the crucial swing low of 10749.”Understanding MACD A close look at the chart of Vodafone Idea shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa. Shares of the company closed 0.55 per cent higher at Rs 36.40 on December 17.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/macd-shows-tata-steel-sail-idea-among-121-stocks-up-for-santa-rally/articleshow/67139607.cms
