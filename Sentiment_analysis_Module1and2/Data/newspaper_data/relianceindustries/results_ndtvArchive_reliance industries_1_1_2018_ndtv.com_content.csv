2018-03-27,"High competition among telecom companies amid aggressive pricing of fast data has been widespread in the Indian telecom industry for a while now. Credit rating agency ICRA said on Tuesday that a revival in the telecom sector in India is likely to be prolonged. ""The pressure on the cash flows of the industry may continue for a few more quarters,"" said ICRA in a note. This is due to the price competition, which has exerted significant pressures on the industry in financial year 2018 and continues to remain intense as the larger operators are contesting to acquire subscribers of the exiting telecom companies, the agency added.The entry of Reliance Industries' telecom firm Reliance Jio disrupted the sector in 2016 with free voice and cut-price data plans, driving consolidation in the industry and forcing out smaller players.ICRA estimated the debt level of the telecom industry at Rs 4.7 lakh crore as on March 31, 2018, and expects it to reduce to Rs. 4.3 lakh crore by FY2019 driven by asset monetisation and increased promoter support.Here are 5 things to know on what ICRA said about the stressed telecom sector:1. Over the longer term, ICRA sees recovery in the telecom sector backed by a consolidated structure, better pricing power and data usage with greater price-inelasticity.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });2. By the end of next fiscal year, the industry is likely to witness better outlook driven by improvement in pricing levels. Meanwhile, the debt level of the industry, which would remain elevated as on March 2018, is expected to witness some reduction by way of promoter funding and asset monetisation.3. ""The exit of smaller telcos has provided an opportunity for larger telcos to garner subscribers and the competition for them remains intense. We expect the migration of subscribers from the exiting telcos to the continuing telcos to complete over the next six months,"" said Harsh Jagnani, sector head and vice president-corporate ratings, ICRA.4. ""But till such time, the pricing levels in the industry are unlikely to witness material improvement. This can be witnessed from the fact that the trend of steady increase in Average Revenue per SIM (ARPS), led by RJio's plans, witnessed till December 2017 has since been reversed due to discounted price offerings,"" he said.5. ICRA pointed out that larger telcos - Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular, Vodafone India, BSNL/MTNL and Reliance Jio - have added 207 million active subscribers over the last 15 months. A large proportion of this, according to ICRA, has come at the expense of discontinuing telecom companies, which have lost 122 million active subscribers over this period.

2018-04-16,"Tokyo:                             The discovery of potentially millions of tons of valuable ""rare earth"" elements in sea sludge off Japan has raised hopes that Asia's number-two economy can reduce its dependence on Chinese supply.But experts warn that extracting the minerals, used in technology ranging from mobile phones to electric vehicles, is both costly and difficult, especially when buried miles deep in the ocean.A Japanese study published last week revealed an estimated 16 million tons of rare earths, enough to feed global demand on a ""semi-infinite"" basis, with deposits to last hundreds of years.The news made headlines internationally and in Japan, which is the world's second-largest consumer of these minerals but relies heavily on imports from China, which controls 90 percent of the highly strategic market.China extracted around 150,000 tons of rare earths in 2016, according to experts, but has in the past restricted the supply amid political tensions.For this reason, ""Japan is looking for several ways of freeing itself from any dependence on Chinese supply,"" said Gaetan Lefebvre, an expert at the French Geological Survey.Japanese firms are working on recycling products containing rare earths to re-use the elements, developing technology without rare earths and investing in foreign mining projects in exchange for the minerals.And Japan is not alone in trying to diversify away from risky China -- there are currently 38 projects outside China at various stages of development, according to Adamas Intelligence, a metal and minerals research firm.In addition to wanting to cut reliance on China, the price of rare earths is rising due to a Chinese crackdown on illegal mining and surging demand for electric vehicles.'Resource Security'The study's author, Yutaro Takaya from Tokyo's Waseda University, says his team hopes to develop ways to extract the prized elements within five years.""We are not talking about some dream technology of the distant future. We are conducting studies to make this possible,"" he told AFP.The recent find ""should contribute to the 'resource security' of Japan"", he said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });""It can also serve as a diplomatic card. Japan will be able to say, 'if prices are made to go above this level, we can look to developing sea-bottom rare earths',"" added the researcher.Ryan Castilloux, director of the Adamas Intelligence consultancy, acknowledged the find was ""impressive"" but recommended keeping the champagne on ice.""It takes up to 10 years or more to advance a rare earth project from discovery into a producing mine on land, so I do not imagine it will be faster in the sea,"" he said.""The discovery in Japan is still in its very early stages and it will take several years to determine if mining will be feasible,"" added Castilloux.There is currently no profitable way of extracting rare earths from that sort of depth -- more than five kilometres (three miles) below the surface.""Pilot mining tests have been performed, but it remains to be seen who will be the first to produce ore at a cost that is less than the value of the commodity,"" noted Mark Hannington from the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in the northern German city of Kiel.""Although 16 million tons is a large number, there is no evidence that this amount could be recovered economically or sustainably,"" added the expert.Analysts also point to the relatively weak concentration -- less than one percent -- of rare earths actually in the sea mud.""Producing just 1,000 tons of rare earth oxide from this source would require mining over one million tons of mud,"" said Castilloux.And the United States Geological Survey estimated last year there were 120 million tons of rare earth deposits worldwide, with 44 million in China, 22 million in Brazil and 18 million in Russia.""There are millions and millions of tons of rare earths in other known land-based deposits around the world that, in my view, would be more attractive options for development,"" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

2018-04-23,"HighlightsJio spent billions during rollout period without the costs showing upIts depreciation and amortization costs also surprised analystsJio's entry nipped profits of Airtel, Idea and Vodafonewindow._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'});                                A smartphone in India cost more than $200 just two years ago. Now you can get a decent phone for nothing but a refundable deposit of $23. Data packages are cheap, and a startup company even throws in free voice calls for life. For this, consumers can thank Mukesh Ambani, a 61-year-old petrochemicals titan who is the country's richest man. From his perch overseeing Reliance Industries Ltd., one of India's largest conglomerates, Ambani has plowed more than $38 billion into his wireless entry, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. It's a classic business disruption. Jio has quickly garnered 14 per cent of a market that is expanding rapidly, putting pressure on other mobile phone providers.Along the way, virtually every promise Ambani made about the company's performance in the marketplace has held up, from inexpensive Jio handsets to state-of-the-art wireless connections.But one claim merits a closer look: that Jio has been profitable virtually from its commercial launch. And it's a worthwhile exercise, given talk of a possible initial public offering for the unit or even an acquisition.Unusual AccountingA review of Jio's unaudited results for the last year shows that the wireless venture and its parent relied on a series of accounting decisions that wound up portraying Jio's financial performance in the best possible light.Analysts have previously noted some anomalies in Jio's accounting, like the inclusion of six months of revenues in a three-month reporting period.Another accounting decision reveals even more. Jio took advantage of a rule that allowed it to burn through billions of dollars in expenses during its rollout period without the costs showing up on its income statements.Jio's auditor, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, an Indian affiliate of Deloitte LLP, is conducting its annual review of Reliance's numbers. Audited results for the year ended March 31 are expected to be disclosed this week, for Jio as well. It will be the first time Deloitte has audited Jio's sales.Jio will either get Deloitte's blessing or be pushed closer to norms in international financial reporting. A wholesale change is not expected, but any shift in approach could puncture the profitability story that Reliance has been trumpeting in India.""I'm curious to see if Deloitte pushes back on some of management's aggressive estimates,"" said James Cox, a professor at Duke University School of Law and an adviser to the US regulator that oversees auditors.Deloitte officials declined to comment.'No Ambiguity'A Jio spokesman said in a written statement: ""The accounting statements of Jio are based on the applicable Indian Accounting Standards. The accounting treatment has been reviewed and approved by the audit committee of the company and also reviewed by the auditors. Significant accounting policies of the company are described in detail, along with the financial statements issued by the company, and there is no ambiguity involved in the manner that the accounts are prepared.""The vast majority of stock analysts who follow the conglomerate consider it a good investment. Reliance's shares, having languished for several years, took off in early 2017 after it said Jio would emerge from its trial period and begin charging for service. The shares have almost doubled since then. (Reliance's shares have have almost doubled since early 2017.)""I'm baffled by Jio's numbers,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president at India Infoline Ltd., a brokerage firm. ""They are difficult to believe, but at the end of the day Jio is part of Reliance, which has a very strong balance sheet.""Jayanth Varma, an accounting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, without referring specifically to Reliance, said that in India, ""accounting quirks will pass through"" when auditors don't push back. ""In US, there is a lot of discipline because the SEC just picks up the annual reports of some companies by rotation every year and pores into them, and asks questions if they see anything unusual,"" he said.Jio's ImpactBefore Jio came on the scene, India's wireless world was dominated by five carriers, a collection of homegrown firms and Vodafone Group Plc. Unencumbered by legacy 2G and 3G networks, Jio boasted of 4G capability from its launch in September 2016. It offered free data service during its introductory period with a promise of free voice calls for life.Making service available to the masses has been a personal passion for Ambani, who started another wireless company in 2002 called Reliance Infocomm. He lost control of it, though, after his father's death. When the family concern was divided, Mukesh got the old-world businesses based on oil and petrochemicals, and his younger brother got the wireless venture.After striking a deal with his brother to get out of a noncompete clause, Mukesh came roaring back. For a second time, he sought to undercut competitors by selling the lowest-price devices and packages, so that most people -- including vegetable vendors and rickshaw pullers -- could have a phone.""Reliance Jio is the biggest, boldest all-in bet by Mukesh Ambani,"" Bhasin said.Big LaunchThe splashy debut in late 2016 attracted millions of first-time users and lured some customers from other providers. Jio's entry nipped the profits of the country's three biggest providers -- Bharti Airtel Ltd., Idea Cellular Ltd. and the Indian unit of Vodafone. Each reported a steep decline in average revenue per user during the Jio launch period. By the end of it, Vodafone and Idea had proposed to merge their own operations. Ambani's brother's mobile company became an also-ran.Meanwhile, by March 2017, Jio had signed more than 100 million users, or roughly 9 per cent of the market.The company ran though an estimated $1.5 billion in its first seven months, when service was virtually free. Jio classified everything associated with the launch -- salaries, sales and distribution costs, interest payments and more -- as capital expenses. It therefore transferred the spending to the balance sheet as an asset that depreciates over time.That practice is unusual for a global company, according to accounting experts. Jio says it complies with local rules.""A company is operational when it begins providing services to customers, even if it's free service,"" said Parveen Gupta, an accounting professor at Lehigh University. ""If you open up an ice cream shop, and give away the product for the first two weeks, you're incurring expenses, even if you're not generating revenue.""When asked about the matter, the Jio spokesman said that expenses can be capitalized until ""commercial launch,"" in accordance with local rules.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });Six-Month QuarterBuoyed by its success in attracting users, Jio announced in February 2017 that it would begin converting to a paid service in April. The effort succeeded, as free subscribers migrated to bargain-basement data packages offering three months of free service in a four-month package. Based on expenses it counted in subsequent quarters, Jio could have lost as much as $1 billion for that quarter, April through June.(Also Read: Reliance Jio's Net Loss Rises To Rs. 22.5 Crore In October-March)But instead of reporting results for that period, management decided to wait a quarter, reasoning that the three months of free service justified a delay, a person familiar with the company said. When it posted for July through September, it effectively packed six months of sales into one quarter while counting only three months of expenses.The total, more than $1 billion in sales at the exchange rate at the time, impressed analysts. Jio's operating earnings were $220 million. Overall, it had a modest loss of $41 million, and subscriber numbers were growing 12 per cent a quarter.(Also Read: Reliance Industries Q2 Profit Rises 12.5%, Jio Loss At Rs 271 Crore)A few research analysts noted the sales irregularity. Morgan Stanley estimated that 20 per cent of the revenue came from the prior quarter, while ICICI Securities estimated that 13 per cent did.Analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and HSBC Global Research pointed out that Jio's expenses seemed unusually low. The company was still capitalizing a significant chunk of salaries and other expenses.Jio's depreciation and amortization costs also surprised. Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, described the rate as ""too good to be believed."" He calculated that Jio's annualized rate was 2 per cent, a quarter of the rate reported by Bharti Airtel and Idea.""That's a warning sign,"" said Charles Mulford, an accounting professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""It signals that they'll likely have to write down the assets later on.""At the time of the Bernstein report, Jio said it was depreciating the wireless portion of the business, though it was spending on other future services, like broadband for business.""Only the wireless assets are currently getting depreciated as they have been put to commercial use,"" the Jio spokesman said. ""Other assets have not yet been capitalized.""The next quarter, Jio turned a profit. For the three months that ended in December, revenue grew by about 12 per cent and subscribers by 15 per cent. Net income was $76 million.Government HelpCompetitors have cried foul about Jio's practices. They have publicly protested several decisions by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India that benefited Jio, including a rule change that subjected them but not Jio to pricing restrictions. Jio's competitors and the regulator declined to comment.Rivals were also fined -- fines that they are contesting -- after they limited connections for Jio callers on their networks. They complained that Jio used its testing phase to sign up millions of subscribers with the promise of free calls. Call failures soared for Jio.The Cellular Operators Association of India issued a statement saying, ""For some reason these orders seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators.""Jio condemned the trade group's ""reckless, willful and flagrant act of making slanderous and libelous accusations.""A few stock analysts are beginning to grow wary. UBS has a ""sell"" rating on Reliance Industries shares, while Jefferies and Macquarie have rated it ""underperform."" The company's total debt stands at about $25 billion, up more than $10 billion from 2010, before Reliance's spending binge on the wireless venture.""Ambani has played a gamble,"" Bhasin, of India Infoline, said, ""but he also has a proven track record in executing projects.""Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

2018-05-11,"The Jio Rs199/month rental (pre-service tax) postpaid plan comes with a 25 GB data allowance and unlimited domestic voice calls. The plan also comes with pre-activated ISD calling facility.Share prices of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular fell sharply today after Reliance Jio Infocomm unveiled a new post-paid plan. Jio, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries, introduced an unlimited domestic post-paid plan for Rs 199 and international calling starting at 50 paise per minute, starting 15 May. Under the Jio's post-paid offering all services such as voice, internet, SMS, international calling will be pre-activated. Shares of Idea fell as much as 12.9 per cent to Rs 50.80 at day's low while Bharti Airtel declined around 7.5 per cent. Reliance Jio's entry into the telecoms sector has set off a brutal price war among operators as they drastically cut prices to compete with Jio's aggressive plans.The Jio Rs199/month rental (pre-service tax) postpaid plan comes with a 25 GB data allowance and unlimited domestic voice calls. The plan also comes with pre-activated ISD calling facility.For the top three big telecom operators in India, post-paid users make up only 7 percent of the total subscribers, but contribute more than 20 per cent to their revenues, said Jefferies. Airtel and Idea are expected to launch new plans in response to Jio's offer and thus see a further decline in their average revenue per user, Jefferies added.Any 10 per cent cut in post-paid prices will lead to an EBITDA or operating profit to decline of 12 per cent and 6 percent for Idea and Airtel respectively, added Jefferies.“While ISD outgoing is a very low proportion of industry’s overall voice volumes (less than 0.1 per cent of outgoing volumes), we believe the contribution to industry revenues could be in the 1.5-2 per cent vicinity, Rs2000 crore to Rs3000 crore in absolute revenues.” Kotak said in a note.In the March quarter, Bharti Airtel Ltd posted its lowest quarterly profit in nearly 15 years on Tuesday, as a price war in the telecoms sector continued to hurt, while revenue was hit by a regulatory cut in international termination charges. Profit slumped 77.8 per cent to Rs. 82.9 crore in the quarter ended March 31, the company said, its lowest since the quarter ended June, 2003.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });Idea Cellular had posted a sixth straight quarterly net loss that was narrower than expected but showed the firm continues to battle intense competition sparked by rival Reliance Jio. Its net loss widened to Rs. 962 crore in the quarter ended March 31, from Rs. 328 crore rupees in the same period a year earlier.Bharti Airtel shares settled 6 per cent lower at Rs 385 while Idea Cellular shares ended 12 per cent lower Rs 51.45.

2018-05-12,"With the entry of Mukesh Ambani-led Jio Infocomm in 2016, the telecom sector in India has been in financial turmoil. While the smaller players were soon compelled to go off the business, the pain is now having a ripple effect as it recently hampered the earnings of the largest telecom company in India: Bharti Airtel. At the same time, Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Idea Cellular's valuation fell drastically in past two months. The share price has shaved off almost 50% of its value and the Ideal cellular share price now trades around Rs 50 per share. After the dust settles in the telecom sector of India, only four companies are expected to sustainable. These telecom giants are Bharti Airtel, Vodafone-Idea Cellular combine, Reliance Jio, and the MTNL-BSNL.On February 12, the promoters of Idea Cellular -- Aditya Birla Group firms Grasim Industries, Aditya Birla Capital and Hindalco -- had, through their subsidiaries, invested Rs 3,250 crore in Idea's preferential issue. The investment was made at Rs 99.50 per share.Soon after, Idea Cellular announced the successful closure of its Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) on February 23, having issued 42.42 crore equity shares to institutional buyers at an issue price of Rs 82.50 per share aggregating about Rs 3,500 crore.According to industry insiders, the QIP issue had witnessed interest from investors from both India and abroad, and the issue allocation was approximately 56 per cent and 44 per cent to Indian and foreign investors, respectively. But following the sharp drop in Idea's share price, there has been a huge erosion in the value of these investments. According to market insiders, ""QIP investors also lost heavily by 37 per cent of their investment of Rs 3,500 crore.""Bharti Airtel, the most established player in the telecom sector, posted a 77.79 per cent fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 82.90 crore for the March quarter. The company had posted a profit of Rs 373.40 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.The turmoil which began with the advent of Reliance Jio and deepened through 2017, saw the weaker players pack up or merge with bigger entities.In 2017, Airtel signed a memorandum of understanding with Tata Teleservices & Tata Teleservices Maharashtra to merge their Consumer Mobile Businesses for a token payment of Rs 1. Even Norwegian telecom giant Telenor had sold out its India business to Bharti Airtel in 2017.Sistema also exited the market in favour of Reliance Communications, which itself exited the wireless telecom business and sold its towers, spectrum and Media Convergence Nodes assets to Reliance Jio.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });According to industry sources, telecom companies together carry a debt of approximately Rs 5 lakh crore. However, the total sectoral liability -- if one takes into account loans from domestic banks, overseas borrowings and annual spectrum instalments -- is pegged at nearly Rs 8 lakh crore.Successive spectrum auctions over the past seven years -- aimed at increasing government revenue -- have also contributed significantly to the sector's woes.The price of spectrum in India is among the highest in the world and telecom firms have no option but to participate in the auctions and buy this expensive ""raw material"" if they want to stay relevant and competitive in the business.The companies are, however, finding it extremely difficult to recover the crores of rupees spent in the auctions at a time tariffs have plunged. In India, average revenue per user (ARPU) is a measly $2 a month -- perhaps the lowest in the world.Revenues from data services were supposed to flow in with the spectrum in place. But that has not materialised either. Global rating agency Fitch had earlier noted that monthly data consumption levels in Asian markets such as China, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan were nearly three to five times higher than in India.The entry of Jio in September 2016 has added to the troubles of existing players as their primary revenue earner -- voice, accounting for over 80 per cent of revenues -- was suddenly being given away free.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

2018-05-15,"Mumbai: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday admitted an insolvency plea filed by Sweden's Ericsson against Reliance Communications, potentially delaying the Indian firm's plans to sell assets to lighten its debt load. Ericsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage Reliance Communications' nationwide telecoms network, is seeking Rs 1,155 crore ($170 million) from the company and two of its subsidiaries.Worries about the ability of RCom, as the company is widely known, to repay its near $7 billion debt to Indian and foreign banks have been mounting for more than a year. Like other incumbents in the country's telecoms sector, RCom has been hit by a fierce price war over the last year, especially after the entry of Reliance Jio, which offered free voice and cut-price data plans.Run by wealthy businessman Anil Ambani, RCom has said it plans to reduce its debt by selling assets such as airwaves, mobile masts and fibre optic investments.The company also plans to sell most of its wireless assets to Reliance Jio - controlled by the country's richest man and Anil's elder brother Mukesh Ambani - in a deal sources said was worth about $3.8 billion.However, Tuesday's order from the NCLT means that the asset sale would now be overseen by a court-appointed administrator.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });A lawyer for RCom said it would appeal. The company in a press release said it would decide the next course of action after studying the detailed orders of NCLT.Under India's bankruptcy law, insolvency resolution needs to be completed within a maximum 9 months, failing which the company is liquidated. With debt of Rs 45,733 crore ($6.7 billion) at the end of March 2017, RCom is the most-leveraged of all listed telecoms carriers in India. The company shut down its consumer mobile business late last year.RCom's asset sale plan has also stalled as it faces a separate legal challenge after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd filed a petition accusing the company of oppression of minority shareholders and operational mismanagement.RCom shares closed down 8.2 per cent on Tuesday in a broader Mumbai market that ended largely unchanged.

The device, named JioPhone2, will also be available from Aug. 15.Reliance last year launched the JioPhone, which allowed digital payments and was effectively free: buyers could get a device for a refundable fee of 1,500 rupees.On Thursday, billionaire Ambani said the company was eyeing 100 million users for JioPhone, which now also supports Facebook, WhatsApp messenger and YouTube.Reliance is betting big on acquiring content to fuel data consumption in India. The country has over a billion mobile connections, and Reliance has invested in film entertainment firm Eros, Indian production house Balaji Telefilms and music app Saavn.Mumbai: Conglomerate Reliance Industries unveiled a fibre broadband system and said it will extend connectivity to 1,100 cities, stepping up its push to expand in the country's telecoms and internet services sector. Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, said at the oil-to-telecoms giant's 41st annual general meeting that the company will begin registrations for its fibre-to-home service JioGigaFiber from August 15, India's Independence Day.Smart home solutions such as real-time surveillance and security solutions for homes and enterprises will ride on the fibre network, which will potentially connect 50 million homes, Ambani told shareholders at the AGM.Reliance has been testing its fibre broadband system in some cities, offering what it says are higher internet speeds than regular broadband where speed is lost as the fibre reaches only up to the building and not directly into homes.Ambani did not give price plans for JioGigaFiber, unlike for Reliance's telecoms venture Jio that was unveiled in late 2016 with free calls and rock-bottom data rates - a move that upended India's telecoms sector by triggering a price war, dragging margins lower and spurring consolidation.Jio now has 215 million subscribers and is on track to cover 99 per cent of the country, Ambani said.Mumbai-headquartered Reliance also announced the launch of a new internet-enabled low-cost phone at 2,999 Indian rupees ($43.62). The device, named JioPhone2, will also be available from Aug. 15.Reliance last year launched the JioPhone, which allowed digital payments and was effectively free: buyers could get a device for a refundable fee of 1,500 rupees.On Thursday, billionaire Ambani said the company was eyeing 100 million users for JioPhone, which now also supports Facebook, WhatsApp messenger and YouTube.Reliance is betting big on acquiring content to fuel data consumption in India.

2018-07-05,"Reliance Industries (RIL), the oil-to-telecom conglomerate, on Thursday, unveiled a fire broadband system, which will connect 1,100 cities. The JioGigaFiber which can offer internet speed in gigabits per second, will be launched with effect from August 15. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of RIL and the richest Indian, also announced the launch of the latest version of its cheap feature phone at a price of Rs 2,999, besides offering to customers, the chance to replace their old JioPhones with new ones for a price of Rs 501.My Dear Shareowners,A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 41st Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited. This is the first AGM as Reliance begins its Golden Decade. The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2018, along with the Directors' and Auditors' report, a Letter to the Shareholders, and Management's Discussion and Analysis, have already been circulated to you.With your permission, I would like to take them as read.1. Business and Financial PerformanceDear Shareowners,This year has been yet another transformational year for Reliance. On one hand, our new-age consumer businesses have started delivering profits.On the other, our hydrocarbon business (refining and petrochemicals) has further scaled up its capabilities to become more profitable, integrated and predictable in its earnings profile.Together, our hydrocarbon and consumer businesses have helped create more records and scale greater heights than ever before.I am delighted to report yet another record breaking performance by your company. Our net profits grew by more than 20.6% to Rs 36,075 crore.Reliance's earnings profile underwent a fundamental change this year. The company's consumer businesses – Jio and Retail – represented about 13% of the consolidated EBIDTA, up from a mere 2% last year.This increase is especially remarkable because it is taking place at a time when the hydrocarbon businesses are growing rapidly.I can tell you with confidence that Reliance has reached an inflection point.As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses.Reliance continues to be India's largest exporter accounting for 8.9 % of India's total merchandise exports with a value of Rs 176,117 crore with access to markets in 113 countries.Your company paid Rs 26,312 crore of customs and excise duty – 6.4 % of India's total collections during the year – highest in the Indian private sector.We also paid Rs. 42,553 crore of GST, which is another record.Reliance is also the highest Income tax payer in the private sector in India, paying Rs 9,844 crore during the year.2.    Reliance Jio – Our Digital Services InitiativeDear Friends,I want to start with Reliance Jio – OUR DIGITAL SERVICES INITIATIVE. Since I last spoke, we have doubled our customer base to over 215 million now. 215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.We were the world's largest mobile data network last year and the gap from the others has only widened in the last 12 months.Voice usage on the network has grown from 250 crore minutes per day to more than 530 crore minutes per day. The amount of video consumption has grown from 165 crore hours per month to more than 340 crore hours per month. Doubling of these metrics at such scale is truly unparalleled.Our customers are actively engaged with us for more than 290 minutes per day on an average.Friends, Jio's motto is simple:We are determined to connect everyone and everything, everywhere – always at the highest quality and the most affordable price.Like our customer metrics, our NETWORK also CONTINUES to expand rapidly.In terms of COVERAGE… Our network has a wider coverage than any other network in India. We are on track towards achieving our target of 99% population coverage with 4G-LTE.This means that Jio will be present in every district, taluk, gram panchayat and village of India. When it comes to CAPACITY…Over the past 12 months, we have more than doubled our NETWORK CAPACITY. Even after serving the needs of our 215+ MILLION customers, the capacity utilization of the Jio network is LESS THAN 20%.Which means, we can multiply our customer base without additional investment.We have achieved this unprecedented network growth while maintaining our NUMBER ONE position as the FASTEST network in India… as attested by the TRAI speed-test data for each and every month of the past year.We recognize that just around 1% of our customers are yet to enjoy the best user experience some of the time. But we are working tirelessly to satisfy and delight them as well.Let me now update you about the JIOPHONE. JioPhone has taken the country by storm. I am pleased to announce that we have more than 25 MILLION JIOPHONE USERS in India. We are now taking the JioPhone to the next level, with added capabilities and functionalities.While  India  has  pole-vaulted  into  global  leadership  in  the  mobile  broadband  space…  we  still  lag  behind SIGNIFICANTLY in fixed-line broadband.Optical Fiber based fixed-line broadband is the future.Fixed-line broadband offers HUNDREDS OF MEGABITS, even GIGABITS per second of data speeds. Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband, too. Your company has already invested over Rs 250,000 crore for creating state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to provide mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fiber footprint.We will now extend this fiber connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity solutions.FOR THE HOME, this will mean…ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION entertainment on your large screen TVs…MULTI-PARTY VIDEO CONFERENCING from the comfort of your living room… VOICE-ACTIVATED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS who obey your every command… VIRTUAL REALITY GAMING and DIGITAL SHOPPING where you are magically transported into a digital universe of IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES…SMART-HOME SOLUTIONS… where hundreds of devices like security cameras, home appliances… even lights and switches… can be securely controlled by their owners using a smartphone… from both inside and outside the home.This will redefine 24X7 emergency help for all homes.FOR MERCHANTS and SMALL BUSINESSES, fixed-line broadband means…When you combine fixed-line connectivity and cloud applications with the agility and customer obsession of a small owner-driven business you empower them to compete on level terms with larger businesses.Jio is thus performing a task of VITAL NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.Because the success of Indian small businesses and small merchants translates directly into faster and more sustainable growth with large-scale employment for the Indian economy.Likewise, FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES, fixed-line broadband will mean…Having the ability to compete in the global marketplace using digital tools and techniques that are powering the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION…Jio was born with a purpose.To transform India with the power of the Digital Revolution.For this vision to be realised, every Indian must become a DIGITAL INDIAN. However, as many as 500 million Indians still use feature phones, who cannot use the Internet. The doors of Digital Life are closed to them because of the problem of affordability.Today we are introducing another attractive offer to feature phone users. It is the JIOPHONE ""MONSOON HUNGAMA"" offer.Further details about both these offers will soon be made available on jio.com.With the added functionalities, our wider network reach across India and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Jio team is to enable 100 MILLION users on this JIOPHONE platform in the shortest possible time.Friends, JioGigaFiber creates magical experiences that are going to be available to every Indian consumer. SO… WHEN WILL JIOGIGAFIBER BE AVAILABLE? We are currently running beta trials in tens of thousands of homes.Starting this Independence Day, August 15th you can start registering your interest for JioGigaFiber through both MyJio and Jio.com. We will prioritize our JioGigaFiber rollout to those localities from where we receive the highest number of registrations. JIOGIGAFIBER will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world, with rollout happening in 1,100 cities of India simultaneously.So, this 15th of August, Jio welcomes you to celebrate the day of India's Freedom by signing in for every Indian's Digital Freedom.Make sure you register your interest, and more importantly make sure that your neighbors register so that your locality will be among the first to get JIOGIGAFIBER!At Jio, we are determined to take India to be among the top-5 in broadband connectivity, both for mobility as well as fiber based wireline connectivity.We have built future proof networks and will continue to deliver the most advanced technologies to our customers for decades to come.With Jio, we have built a Digital Connectivity Platform of unparalleled capacity and a nation-wide reach. This has enabled Reliance to strategically reinvent itself as a Technology Platform Company.   Digital platforms have become the new-age factories and service providers. These new hyper-growth engines of value creation are fired by the combination of digital connectivity, computing power and software.They use data as the raw material, and Artificial Intelligence plays the role that electricity played in the past.The world is entering into an era of Anytime Value-Creation, Everywhere Value-Creation, and Value-Creation by anyone who has a smart business idea.Dear Shareowners,                                                                                                                        Reliance Retail has been one of the catalysts for the growth of modern organised retail in India.            It is the LARGEST, FASTEST GROWING AND MOST PROFITABLE retail company in India.            Our 7,500 stores received over 350 million footfalls last year. Our revenues crossed Rs 69,000 crore, a growth of over 100% year on year.More than 4,000 new stores were opened during the year, an unprecedented expansion in the retail industry. We now operate over 7,500 stores across more than 4,400 cities.In Grocery, we are the LARGEST MODERN TRADE RETAILER.We sold over 500,000 tonnes of groceries last year, connecting thousands of farmers and small manufacturers to happy customers.Over the years Reliance Market has been creating value for small merchants by bringing both buying and operational efficiency to their businesses.The existing ecosystem of 3 million plus partners will be enabled further with our digital merchant platform. Reliance Retail has emerged as the partner of choice for International brands.It operates the largest portfolio of 41 international retail brands in India. Our network of over 1,300 fully automated and future ready petroleum outlets on key highways cater to major demand centres and witnessed robust revenue growth.Based on our growth initiatives and commitment to our customers, I am confident that Reliance Retail will become bigger, better and more profitable.Friends,As Reliance  transitions  to become  a TECHNOLOGY  PLATFORM  COMPANY, we  see  our  biggest  growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM.We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services.This platform will bring together … The 35 crore and growing customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores... The 21.5 crore and growing JIO connectivity customers.  The targeted 5 crore Jio GIGA-HOMES; and……Most importantly,All the 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers all over India who provide the last-mile physical market connectivity. Hence, we will integrate the physical and digital marketplaces in a uniquely collaborative BHARAT-INDIA JODO enterprise.They will be able to manage inventory, keep digital records and file returns, improve working capital management, retain and upgrade customers, access new customers, run promotion and loyalty programs, link to our highly efficient supply chain, and much more.Our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM will redefine retail in India by enabling all customers ─ rich or poor, whether at home or on mobile ─ to transition from simple shopping to personalised Immersive shopping experience.This will be made possible by Augmented Reality, holographic technology and VR devices.                   Our digital tools will predict and anticipate the needs of shoppers.We will invest in the best data analytics engines using artificial intelligence to bring a powerful offering to all consumers, merchants and small businesses.We will also facilitate availability of financing to small shopkeepers and merchants to improve their capital efficiency, so that they can become competitive and grow their businesses.Thus, the principal purpose of our hybrid NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM is to promote Shared Prosperity.This will enable even the smallest merchant to earn more, employ more people, and give common Indian customers the best value for their money.4. Media and EntertainmentLet me turn to our media and entertainment platform.We have already created a large portfolio of media and digital properties, which are as widespread as they are valuable. We have the largest portfolio of TV Channels in India - 69 Channels across News and Entertainment.  We have India's largest TV News Platform in News18 that is multilingual providing independent and reliable news. We also have India's largest entertainment platform which spans all major regional languages.We are consistently ranked amongst the top players in each of our segments. We are the partner of choice for leading global brands like CNBC, CNN, Forbes, History, MTV and Nickelodeon.Our digital properties MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioMusic, BookMyShow, FirstPost and MoneyControl are all leaders in their category with significant embedded value.We have a leading market share in television broadcasting, movie production and distribution, digital content and commerce, print magazines, mobile content and allied media services businesses,One in every two Indians consume Network18's content.                                                                         One in every five internet users in India is on Network18 websites or apps. Regional content and digital delivery continue to be the focus of Network18, which will drive its future growth. The media and entertainment platform with a viewership in excess of 700 million enables us to achieve a very special societal purpose:Dear Friends,Let  me  illustrate  the  power  of  our  PLATFORM  BUSINESS  STRATEGY  by  highlighting  three  other  large opportunities.AgricultureFirst, and most important, the AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.In  agriculture,  India  has  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to  create  wealth  and  new  knowledge-rich  livelihood opportunities in rural areas.…by  encouraging  adoption  of  technologies  for  water  conservation,  soil  management,  precision  farming, waste reduction…to enhance agricultural productivity.Our purpose is to benefit both the kisan and the consumer.…to more than double the incomes of our farmers.…and to bring nutritious food products to consumers at affordable prices.I am sure that if we combine digital technology tools with the innate knowledge and wisdom of Indian farmers, Jio can usher in a SMART NEW GREEN REVOLUTION in India.EducationSecond, the EDUCATION PLATFORM.The purpose of this platform is to overcome the challenge of poor and inadequate educational infrastructure by digitally delivering high-quality education and skills training to schools, colleges and universities across the country.This will enable every educated Indian youth to earn a respectable livelihood and contribute to the nation's wealth. We have to equip our children to be digitally-savvy right from school.So that we can lay the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India. Through Jio, we are providing broadband connectivity to all the 58,000 colleges and will connect 1.9 million schools across the country.These educational institutions collectively provide education to nearly 200 million children. And all these can be done in less than two years.Here our purpose is to ensure affordable and quality healthcare to all, which is both a national necessity and a national responsibility.For the first time in history, this has become possible because of digital technologies – accessible across the country and even in remote locations.India can considerably overcome the deficit of physical infrastructure of hospitals and doctors by universalising telemedicine, tele-radiology, eDiagnostics, genomics and other cost-effective cloud-based solutions.To summarise, our DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY PLATFORM has served as the foundation on which we are building our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM, OUR MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM, EDUCATION PLATFORM, HEALTHCARE PLATFORM and AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.Going forward, we shall build more such platforms. Each of these will create significant shareholder value and enormous societal value.Dear Friends,Let me now turn to the performance of our hydrocarbons business of petrochemicals and refining. This year Jamnagar completes 20 years of operations. Jamnagar has expanded manifold in scale, complexity, scope and size since we commissioned the world's largest greenfield refinery in 1998.Let me update you on the progress of the projects, as we are now nearing the end of our largest-ever investment at Jamnagar.We have successfully commissioned and stabilized the world's largest Paraxylene complex.Today, Reliance is the second largest PX producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of PX in the world with 4.2 million MT of capacity.We also commissioned the largest off-Gas cracker complex in the world. Using our Refinery off-gasses as feedstock, this cracker is the most cost competitive ethylene cracker, globally. This positions us uniquely, as one of the most efficient producers of Polymers in the world. I am proud to report that both these projects have been completed in a record time frame, at world-beating capital productivity and commissioned flawlessly. Both the Paraxylene and Cracker complexes are already running substantially higher than their design capacity.These high-value materials will cater to the growing needs of India's transportation and alternate energy sectors.All these projects position your company amongst the leading and most-diversified and integrated producer of materials globally.In  Petrochemicals, we  continued  to  generate  value  for  our  customers  through constant  innovation  and product development.As an example, we launched R-Elan, a super micro-denier polyester with unique anti-sweat and anti-bacterial properties for use in active wear.Similarly, our RecoSilk and SuperFeel products have emerged as products of choice in ladies fashion wear. Environmental regulation is now a global imperative.I am happy to state that your company is the largest recycler of PET in India recycling over 2 billion bottles annually. We are committed to becoming a leader in the emerging circular economy and to become one of the largest recyclers of plastics in India,All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business.Dear Shareowners,I am pleased to share that the DTA Gasification complex startup and stabilization was accomplished in a record time of less than 120 days against a typical 9 to 12 months period required for a project of this magnitude and complexity by global peers.The gasification project will eliminate the dependence of the refinery on imported natural gas and add value to our profitability, particularly in a high oil price scenario.Our strategy of a full “Bottom of the Barrel conversion” is truly unique.A key element of our configuration driven competitiveness is the integration of Refining with Petrochemicals. As a result of our robust and flexible configuration we are also uniquely positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in view of IMO 2020.The forthcoming changes in sulphur specifications of bunker fuel will lead to a significant jump in demand for low sulphur distillates.Equally it will benefit versatile and complex refiners like us with a capability to process challenged heavy crude.Dear Friends,We began our “Oil to Chemicals” journey starting with the inception of the Jamnagar complex in 1996-1999 when Reliance challenged the industry paradigm and set a new benchmark by maximizing Propylene and Aromatics.We took a further quantum jump with the commissioning of the world's largest Refinery off gas cracker and the Paraxylene complex.These set of new projects have redefined Oil to Chemicals integration.It is our belief that with the rapidly increasing demand for Petrochemicals maximizing Oil to Chemicals conversion will play a catalytic role in determining profitability of hydrocarbons businesses of the future.As the world migrates from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we will further maximize this Oil to Chemicals conversion and upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals. This up-gradation will be implemented in a phased manner over the next decade to meet the rapidly increasing demand for petrochemicals, in India and the region. The hydrocarbon business is thus poised for robust value creation and exciting times ahead.7. Oil and Gas Exploration and ProductionDear Shareowners,Your company, along with its joint venture partner BP, continues to optimize its India upstream business by pursuing integrated development in KG D6 Block. In these gas field developments, we will deploy many advanced technologies to start gas production in 2020 and reaching full production of 30-35 MMSCMD by 2022.Our Gas marketing JV with BP is looking for opportunities to source and distribute gas to Indian consumers including in cities.Our Coal-Bed Methane production crossed 1 MMSCMD level last year.I am confident that our participation in the gas economy of India will generate value in the coming years.8. Reliance FoundationDear Shareholders,Our diverse sports initiatives provide a world class platform to young sportspersons.In recognition of her accomplishments in the field of sports, Nita was awarded the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar by the Honourable President of India.Reliance Foundation's rural transformation initiatives are focused on establishing strong market linkages for farmers and leveraging technology for better reach and impact.The initiatives now reach out to over 13,500 villages in 15 states across the country.We are now focused on increasing our reach and expanding the scope of our Foundation to deliver impact to larger sections of India through a combination of partnership and direct action.I hope to share several success stories with all of you in the future as Reliance Foundation continues to make a difference as the largest corporate Foundation in India.9. Value Creation RoadmapDear Shareholders,Last year I had shared with you my vision for value creation in Reliance's Golden Decade. We are laying a robust foundation to realise this vision.We have already made a lot of progress in the past year.Reliance is making a strategic transition to become a Technology Platform Company. We are focussed on creating multiple platforms that will accelerate our growth and create significant societal value for years to come.Our connectivity platform has already made Jio the largest mobile data network in the world. Through JioGigaFibre we will now build the home-and-office connectivity platform.The third big platform that we are building is New Commerce.This platform has the potential to redefine retailing in India and become one of the biggest new growth engines for Reliance in the years to come.We are also looking at nation-wide platforms in Agriculture, Education and Healthcare.I am confident that our growth in these consumer businesses, based on asset-light platforms of the future, will be non- linear and exponential.In our hydrocarbon businesses, the largest ever cycle of investment in our world-scale complex projects is nearly complete.This will yield healthy profits for many years to come.The value-chain integration allows us to create an annuity-like cash flow with lower risk of cyclical markets.This will minimise the impact of renewables and electricity on transportation fuels. We have the unique advantage, among global players, of being able to pursue this strategy with physical integration at one large site.I am confident that our current business model and planned investments make our hydrocarbon portfolio future-proof with sustained earnings growth.We are committed to strengthening our balance sheet while we pursue growth and realise multiple monetisations.As the earnings from our consumer businesses begin to match those from our hydrocarbon businesses, I assure you that the next decade will truly become a Golden Decade for Reliance.10.    ConclusionFriends,Reliance has always been a responsible Corporate Citizen. We know fully that our responsibilities have grown with our opportunities. We shall discharge them with utmost commitment.Employment generation for all our youth has become an urgent national imperative. In addition to employing as many as 200,000 people in the last two years alone, Jio and Retail have created indirect livelihood opportunities for 1 million people across India.In all our digital service businesses, data privacy is sacrosanct. Cyber-security is our solemn promise.Our energy and petrochemical businesses follow the philosophy of not only the Green Economy but also the Circular Economy.Because we care for the Environment, which is the most precious asset of mankind.Lastly, ensuring the safety, satisfaction and happiness of our employees is our Dharma, because, for me, all of them are members of the extended Reliance Family.Before I conclude, permit me once again to share with you ─ and with all my dear countrymen ─ a dream I have inherited from my father.It is the dream to see India become an economic superpower. And to see that India becomes a global leader in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. India's prosperity and Reliance's progress have been closely intertwined in every phase of our journey so far. Which is why, Reliance has become a shining icon of Modern India.As India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period.And the creation of societal value by Reliance will be of an even higher order.Old-timers amongst you will recall that whenever our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani spoke of India, there was a surge of patriotic passion in the audience.He always urged us to 'Think big, think fast, think ahead…and, above all, THINK OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO BRIGHTEN INDIA'S FUTURE.'May the God Almighty bless us in our endeavour.11. AcknowledgementsI would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their unanimous support and immense encouragement.I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly for creating and sustaining a world-class enterprise.Thank you.Reliance Industries (RIL), the oil-to-telecom conglomerate, on Thursday, unveiled a fire broadband system, which will connect 1,100 cities. The JioGigaFiber which can offer internet speed in gigabits per second, will be launched with effect from August 15. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of RIL and the richest Indian, also announced the launch of the latest version of its cheap feature phone at a price of Rs 2,999, besides offering to customers, the chance to replace their old JioPhones with new ones for a price of Rs 501.Here is the full text of Mukesh Ambani's speech at Reliance Industries' 41st annual general meeting (AGM): My Dear Shareowners,    A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 41st Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited. This is the first AGM as Reliance begins its Golden Decade. The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2018, along with the Directors' and Auditors' report, a Letter to the Shareholders, and Management's Discussion and Analysis, have already been circulated to you.With your permission, I would like to take them as read.1. Business and Financial Performance       Dear Shareowners,                                                                 This year has been yet another transformational year for Reliance. On one hand, our new-age consumer businesses have started delivering profits.On the other, our hydrocarbon business (refining and petrochemicals) has further scaled up its capabilities to become more profitable, integrated and predictable in its earnings profile.Together, our hydrocarbon and consumer businesses have helped create more records and scale greater heights than ever before.I am delighted to report yet another record breaking performance by your company. Our net profits grew by more than 20.6% to Rs 36,075 crore.                    Reliance's earnings profile underwent a fundamental change this year. The company's consumer businesses – Jio and Retail – represented about 13% of the consolidated EBIDTA, up from a mere 2% last year.This increase is especially remarkable because it is taking place at a time when the hydrocarbon businesses are growing rapidly.I can tell you with confidence that Reliance has reached an inflection point.As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses.Reliance continues to be India's largest exporter accounting for 8.9 % of India's total merchandise exports with a value of Rs 176,117 crore with access to markets in 113 countries.Your company paid Rs 26,312 crore of customs and excise duty – 6.4 % of India's total collections during the year – highest in the Indian private sector.We also paid Rs. 42,553 crore of GST, which is another record.                                                     Reliance is also the highest Income tax payer in the private sector in India, paying Rs 9,844 crore during the year.2.    Reliance Jio – Our Digital Services InitiativeDear Friends,I want to start with Reliance Jio – OUR DIGITAL SERVICES INITIATIVE. Since I last spoke, we have doubled our customer base to over 215 million now. 215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.In the last one year, we have achieved UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH starting with an already existing large base:Data usage has grown from 125 crore GBs per month to more than 240 crore GBs per month.We were the world's largest mobile data network last year and the gap from the others has only widened in the last 12 months.Voice usage on the network has grown from 250 crore minutes per day to more than 530 crore minutes per day. The amount of video consumption has grown from 165 crore hours per month to more than 340 crore hours per month. Doubling of these metrics at such scale is truly unparalleled.  Our customers are actively engaged with us for more than 290 minutes per day on an average.Friends, Jio's motto is simple:We are determined to connect everyone and everything, everywhere – always at the highest quality and the most affordable price.Like our customer metrics, our NETWORK also CONTINUES to expand rapidly.                In terms of COVERAGE… Our network has a wider coverage than any other network in India. We are on track towards achieving our target of 99% population coverage with 4G-LTE.  This means that Jio will be present in every district, taluk, gram panchayat and village of India. When it comes to CAPACITY…                                                                                      Over the past 12 months, we have more than doubled our NETWORK CAPACITY. Even after serving the needs of our 215+ MILLION customers, the capacity utilization of the Jio network is LESS THAN 20%.Which means, we can multiply our customer base without additional investment.We have achieved this unprecedented network growth while maintaining our NUMBER ONE position as the FASTEST network in India… as attested by the TRAI speed-test data for each and every month of the past year.We recognize that just around 1% of our customers are yet to enjoy the best user experience some of the time. But we are working tirelessly to satisfy and delight them as well.Jio is a customer obsessed organization and will work harder to ensure that not even one consumer remains dissatisfied on our network.Let me now update you about the JIOPHONE. JioPhone has taken the country by storm. I am pleased to announce that we have more than 25 MILLION JIOPHONE USERS in India. We are now taking the JioPhone to the next level, with added capabilities and functionalities.Friends,WHAT COMES NEXT FOR BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY IN INDIA?While  India  has  pole-vaulted  into  global  leadership  in  the  mobile  broadband  space…  we  still  lag  behind SIGNIFICANTLY in fixed-line broadband.India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband, Poor fixed-line infrastructure has been a key reason for this.In countries with better developed communication infrastructure, more than 80% of data consumption happens INDOORS THROUGH FIXED-LINE CONNECTIVITY in homes, in offices and other premises.Optical Fiber based fixed-line broadband is the future.Fixed-line broadband offers HUNDREDS OF MEGABITS, even GIGABITS per second of data speeds. Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband, too. Your company has already invested over Rs 250,000 crore for creating state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to provide mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fiber footprint.We will now extend this fiber connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity solutions.FOR THE HOME, this will mean…ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION entertainment on your large screen TVs…MULTI-PARTY VIDEO CONFERENCING from the comfort of your living room… VOICE-ACTIVATED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS who obey your every command… VIRTUAL REALITY GAMING and DIGITAL SHOPPING where you are magically transported into a digital universe of IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES…SMART-HOME SOLUTIONS… where hundreds of devices like security cameras, home appliances… even lights and switches… can be securely controlled by their owners using a smartphone… from both inside and outside the home.This will redefine 24X7 emergency help for all homes.FOR MERCHANTS and SMALL BUSINESSES, fixed-line broadband means…When you combine fixed-line connectivity and cloud applications with the agility and customer obsession of a small owner-driven business you empower them to compete on level terms with larger businesses.Jio is thus performing a task of VITAL NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.Because the success of Indian small businesses and small merchants translates directly into faster and more sustainable growth with large-scale employment for the Indian economy.Likewise, FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES, fixed-line broadband will mean…Having the ability to compete in the global marketplace using digital tools and techniques that are powering the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION…We are calling this fiber based broadband service JIO GIGAFIBER. Dear Friends,The three most popular apps YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook will be available to all the JioPhone users from 15th August.Jio was born with a purpose.                                                                      To transform India with the power of the Digital Revolution.                        For this vision to be realised, every Indian must become a DIGITAL INDIAN. However, as many as 500 million Indians still use feature phones, who cannot use the Internet. The doors of Digital Life are closed to them because of the problem of affordability.  Which is why, last year we offered the JioPhone – India Ka Smartphone – for a fully refundable deposit of Rs 1500. In other words, for an effective price of zero.25 million Indians have availed this scheme and become JioPhone users. This scheme will, of course, continue.                                              Today we are introducing another attractive offer to feature phone users. It is the JIOPHONE ""MONSOON HUNGAMA"" offer.Starting July 21st... they can exchange their existing feature phone for a brand new JIOPHONE for just Rs 501! We have thus reduced the effective entry cost of the JioPhone from Rs 1500 to as low as Rs 501.            Starting 15th August, our JioPhone2 will be available at an introductory price of only Rs 2999.Our purpose is to accelerate the Digital Revolution in India with the extreme affordability of a JioPhone, so that each and every Indian can access the internet and enjoy the Digital Life.Further details about both these offers will soon be made available on jio.com.With the added functionalities, our wider network reach across India and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Jio team is to enable 100 MILLION users on this JIOPHONE platform in the shortest possible time.Friends, JioGigaFiber creates magical experiences that are going to be available to every Indian consumer. SO… WHEN WILL JIOGIGAFIBER BE AVAILABLE? We are currently running beta trials in tens of thousands of homes.Starting this Independence Day, August 15th you can start registering your interest for JioGigaFiber through both MyJio and Jio.com. We will prioritize our JioGigaFiber rollout to those localities from where we receive the highest number of registrations. JIOGIGAFIBER will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world, with rollout happening in 1,100 cities of India simultaneously.So, this 15th of August, Jio welcomes you to celebrate the day of India's Freedom by signing in for every Indian's Digital Freedom.Make sure you register your interest, and more importantly make sure that your neighbors register so that your locality will be among the first to get JIOGIGAFIBER!At Jio, we are determined to take India to be among the top-5 in broadband connectivity, both for mobility as well as fiber based wireline connectivity.We have built future proof networks and will continue to deliver the most advanced technologies to our customers for decades to come.With Jio, we have built a Digital Connectivity Platform of unparalleled capacity and a nation-wide reach. This has enabled Reliance to strategically reinvent itself as a Technology Platform Company.   Digital platforms have become the new-age factories and service providers. These new hyper-growth engines of value creation are fired by the combination of digital connectivity, computing power and software.They use data as the raw material, and Artificial Intelligence plays the role that electricity played in the past.The world is entering into an era of Anytime Value-Creation, Everywhere Value-Creation, and Value-Creation by anyone who has a smart business idea.I  am  happy to inform  you  that  your  company  has  prepared  itself  for  this  exciting  future  of  non-linear  and exponential growth.3. Reliance RetailDear Shareowners,                                                                                                                        Reliance Retail has been one of the catalysts for the growth of modern organised retail in India.            It is the LARGEST, FASTEST GROWING AND MOST PROFITABLE retail company in India.            Our 7,500 stores received over 350 million footfalls last year. Our revenues crossed Rs 69,000 crore, a growth of over 100% year on year.                                         More than 4,000 new stores were opened during the year, an unprecedented expansion in the retail industry. We now operate over 7,500 stores across more than 4,400 cities.                                     Reliance Digital is the LARGEST RETAILER OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS in the country.Reliance Trends continues to be the LARGEST FASHION RETAILER in India…. It sells nearly 1.2 crore garments a month or over 33,000 garments every hour.In Grocery, we are the LARGEST MODERN TRADE RETAILER.We sold over 500,000 tonnes of groceries last year, connecting thousands of farmers and small manufacturers to happy customers.Over the years Reliance Market has been creating value for small merchants by bringing both buying and operational efficiency to their businesses.The existing ecosystem of 3 million plus partners will be enabled further with our digital merchant platform. Reliance Retail has emerged as the partner of choice for International brands.                        It operates the largest portfolio of 41 international retail brands in India. Our network of over 1,300 fully automated and future ready petroleum outlets on key highways cater to major demand centres and witnessed robust revenue growth.Based on our growth initiatives and commitment to our customers, I am confident that Reliance Retail will become bigger, better and more profitable.Friends,As Reliance  transitions  to become  a TECHNOLOGY  PLATFORM  COMPANY, we  see  our  biggest  growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM.We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services.This platform will bring together … The 35 crore and growing customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores... The 21.5 crore and growing JIO connectivity customers.  The targeted 5 crore Jio GIGA-HOMES; and……Most importantly,All the 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers all over India who provide the last-mile physical market connectivity. Hence, we will integrate the physical and digital marketplaces in a uniquely collaborative BHARAT-INDIA JODO enterprise.We see merchants and small shop owners as critical customer interaction and fulfilment points, who will share a mutually beneficial win-win relationship with us.Through the deployment of Merchant Point of Sale for small shop owners, we will enable them to do everything that large enterprises and large ecommerce players are able to do.They will be able to manage inventory, keep digital records and file returns, improve working capital management, retain and upgrade customers, access new customers, run promotion and loyalty programs, link to our highly efficient supply chain, and much more.Our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM will redefine retail in India by enabling all customers ─ rich or poor, whether at home or on mobile ─ to transition from simple shopping to personalised Immersive shopping experience.This will be made possible by Augmented Reality, holographic technology and VR devices.                   Our digital tools will predict and anticipate the needs of shoppers.                                           JioGigaFiber will bring the entire marketplace to large screens powered by high speed broadband at home.We will also leverage Reliance Retail's deep insights into Indian customers, large local presence, and best-in-class supply chain.We will invest in the best data analytics engines using artificial intelligence to bring a powerful offering to all consumers, merchants and small businesses.We will also facilitate availability of financing to small shopkeepers and merchants to improve their capital efficiency, so that they can become competitive and grow their businesses.Thus, the principal purpose of our hybrid NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM is to promote Shared Prosperity.This will enable even the smallest merchant to earn more, employ more people, and give common Indian customers the best value for their money.4. Media and EntertainmentLet me turn to our media and entertainment platform.We have already created a large portfolio of media and digital properties, which are as widespread as they are valuable. We have the largest portfolio of TV Channels in India - 69 Channels across News and Entertainment.  We have India's largest TV News Platform in News18 that is multilingual providing independent and reliable news. We also have India's largest entertainment platform which spans all major regional languages.We are consistently ranked amongst the top players in each of our segments. We are the partner of choice for leading global brands like CNBC, CNN, Forbes, History, MTV and Nickelodeon.    Our digital properties MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioMusic, BookMyShow, FirstPost and MoneyControl are all leaders in their category with significant embedded value.We have a leading market share in television broadcasting, movie production and distribution, digital content and commerce, print magazines, mobile content and allied media services businesses,One in every two Indians consume Network18's content.                                                                         One in every five internet users in India is on Network18 websites or apps. Regional content and digital delivery continue to be the focus of Network18, which will drive its future growth. The media and entertainment platform with a viewership in excess of 700 million enables us to achieve a very special societal purpose:Our purpose is two-fold: to provide wholesome entertainment and to enrich the power of Ideas that can make India a great nation.5.    Other Platform OpportunitiesDear Friends,Let  me  illustrate  the  power  of  our  PLATFORM  BUSINESS  STRATEGY  by  highlighting  three  other  large opportunities.AgricultureFirst, and most important, the AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.In  agriculture,  India  has  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to  create  wealth  and  new  knowledge-rich  livelihood opportunities in rural areas.…by  encouraging  adoption  of  technologies  for  water  conservation,  soil  management,  precision  farming, waste reduction…to enhance agricultural productivity.                        Our purpose is to benefit both the kisan and the consumer.…to more than double the incomes of our farmers.…and to bring nutritious food products to consumers at affordable prices.I am sure that if we combine digital technology tools with the innate knowledge and wisdom of Indian farmers, Jio can usher in a SMART NEW GREEN REVOLUTION in India.EducationSecond, the EDUCATION PLATFORM.The purpose of this platform is to overcome the challenge of poor and inadequate educational infrastructure by digitally delivering high-quality education and skills training to schools, colleges and universities across the country.This will enable every educated Indian youth to earn a respectable livelihood and contribute to the nation's wealth. We have to equip our children to be digitally-savvy right from school.So that we can lay the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India. Through Jio, we are providing broadband connectivity to all the 58,000 colleges and will connect 1.9 million schools across the country.These educational institutions collectively provide education to nearly 200 million children. And all these can be done in less than two years.                                                                        Jio will achieve this by partnering with a large number of stakeholders. Once this is done, India will have one of the most-digitally enabled education systems in the world. HealthcareThird, the HEALTHCARE PLATFORM.Here our purpose is to ensure affordable and quality healthcare to all, which is both a national necessity and a national responsibility.For the first time in history, this has become possible because of digital technologies – accessible across the country and even in remote locations.India can considerably overcome the deficit of physical infrastructure of hospitals and doctors by universalising telemedicine, tele-radiology, eDiagnostics, genomics and other cost-effective cloud-based solutions.This cannot happen overnight.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });It is a long-term gestation opportunity, and we will pursue this with a host of partners to realise this for India to become a global leader in healthcare.To summarise, our DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY PLATFORM has served as the foundation on which we are building our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM, OUR MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM, EDUCATION PLATFORM, HEALTHCARE PLATFORM and AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.Going forward, we shall build more such platforms. Each of these will create significant shareholder value and enormous societal value.6. Hydrocarbons BusinessDear Friends,                                                                                                                            Let me now turn to the performance of our hydrocarbons business of petrochemicals and refining. This year Jamnagar completes 20 years of operations. Jamnagar has expanded manifold in scale, complexity, scope and size since we commissioned the world's largest greenfield refinery in 1998.Let me update you on the progress of the projects, as we are now nearing the end of our largest-ever investment at Jamnagar.We have successfully commissioned and stabilized the world's largest Paraxylene complex.Today, Reliance is the second largest PX producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of PX in the world with 4.2 million MT of capacity.We also commissioned the largest off-Gas cracker complex in the world. Using our Refinery off-gasses as feedstock, this cracker is the most cost competitive ethylene cracker, globally. This positions us uniquely, as one of the most efficient producers of Polymers in the world. I am proud to report that both these projects have been completed in a record time frame, at world-beating capital productivity and commissioned flawlessly. Both the Paraxylene and Cracker complexes are already running substantially higher than their design capacity.The Butyl rubber project will be commissioned later this year.We are also adding a new line of materials to our portfolio– composites and carbon fibre.These high-value materials will cater to the growing needs of India's transportation and alternate energy sectors.All these projects position your company amongst the leading and most-diversified and integrated producer of materials globally.In  Petrochemicals, we  continued  to  generate  value  for  our  customers  through constant  innovation  and product development.As an example, we launched R-Elan, a super micro-denier polyester with unique anti-sweat and anti-bacterial properties for use in active wear.Similarly, our RecoSilk and SuperFeel products have emerged as products of choice in ladies fashion wear. Environmental regulation is now a global imperative.                                                                                              I am happy to state that your company is the largest recycler of PET in India recycling over 2 billion bottles annually. We are committed to becoming a leader in the emerging circular economy and to become one of the largest recyclers of plastics in India,All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business.Dear Shareowners,                      Let me now turn to Refining business.This year we commissioned the world's largest and most unique Petcoke gasification project.I am pleased to share that the DTA Gasification complex startup and stabilization was accomplished in a record time of less than 120 days against a typical 9 to 12 months period required for a project of this magnitude and complexity by global peers.The gasification project will eliminate the dependence of the refinery on imported natural gas and add value to our profitability, particularly in a high oil price scenario.Our strategy of a full “Bottom of the Barrel conversion” is truly unique.                                                     A key element of our configuration driven competitiveness is the integration of Refining with Petrochemicals. As a result of our robust and flexible configuration we are also uniquely positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in view of IMO 2020.The forthcoming changes in sulphur specifications of bunker fuel will lead to a significant jump in demand for low sulphur distillates.Equally it will benefit versatile and complex refiners like us with a capability to process challenged heavy crude.Dear Friends,We began our “Oil to Chemicals” journey starting with the inception of the Jamnagar complex in 1996-1999 when Reliance challenged the industry paradigm and set a new benchmark by maximizing Propylene and Aromatics.We took a further quantum jump with the commissioning of the world's largest Refinery off gas cracker and the Paraxylene complex.These set of new projects have redefined Oil to Chemicals integration.It is our belief that with the rapidly increasing demand for Petrochemicals maximizing Oil to Chemicals conversion will play a catalytic role in determining profitability of hydrocarbons businesses of the future.As the world migrates from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we will further maximize this Oil to Chemicals conversion and upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals. This up-gradation will be implemented in a phased manner over the next decade to meet the rapidly increasing demand for petrochemicals, in India and the region. The hydrocarbon business is thus poised for robust value creation and exciting times ahead.7. Oil and Gas Exploration and ProductionDear Shareowners,Your company, along with its joint venture partner BP, continues to optimize its India upstream business by pursuing integrated development in KG D6 Block. In these gas field developments, we will deploy many advanced technologies to start gas production in 2020 and reaching full production of 30-35 MMSCMD by 2022.Our Gas marketing JV with BP is looking for opportunities to source and distribute gas to Indian consumers including in cities.Our Coal-Bed Methane production crossed 1 MMSCMD level last year.                                        We have started the second phase of CBM development to more than double the current production.Your company is proposing a cross-border merger of RHUSA with RIL thereby integrating the US gas resources with Indian market as we have done with ethane for Petro-chemicals.I am confident that our participation in the gas economy of India will generate value in the coming years.8. Reliance FoundationDear Shareholders,                                                                            I would now like to share the good work being done by our Foundation.Let us congratulate Nita for her leadership of the Foundation and her relentless efforts in driving grassroots sports and education in the country.Our diverse sports initiatives provide a world class platform to young sportspersons.In recognition of her accomplishments in the field of sports, Nita was awarded the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar by the Honourable President of India.Reliance Foundation's rural transformation initiatives are focused on establishing strong market linkages for farmers and leveraging technology for better reach and impact.The initiatives now reach out to over 13,500 villages in 15 states across the country.We are now focused on increasing our reach and expanding the scope of our Foundation to deliver impact to larger sections of India through a combination of partnership and direct action.I hope to share several success stories with all of you in the future as Reliance Foundation continues to make a difference as the largest corporate Foundation in India.9. Value Creation RoadmapDear Shareholders,                                                                                                    Last year I had shared with you my vision for value creation in Reliance's Golden Decade. We are laying a robust foundation to realise this vision.                                                We have already made a lot of progress in the past year.                                     Reliance is making a strategic transition to become a Technology Platform Company. We are focussed on creating multiple platforms that will accelerate our growth and create significant societal value for years to come.Our connectivity platform has already made Jio the largest mobile data network in the world. Through JioGigaFibre we will now build the home-and-office connectivity platform.            A platform that potentially connects 50 million homes.                                                        It will be as big as the mobile connectivity platform. Moreover, it will have a much higher value proposition because the core investments have been made while building the mobility network.The third big platform that we are building is New Commerce.This platform has the potential to redefine retailing in India and become one of the biggest new growth engines for Reliance in the years to come.We are also looking at nation-wide platforms in Agriculture, Education and Healthcare.I am confident that our growth in these consumer businesses, based on asset-light platforms of the future, will be non- linear and exponential.In our hydrocarbon businesses, the largest ever cycle of investment in our world-scale complex projects is nearly complete.This will yield healthy profits for many years to come.The value-chain integration allows us to create an annuity-like cash flow with lower risk of cyclical markets.Reliance was among the first companies globally that adopted an 'Oil to Chemicals' strategy and manage it as one integrated business.We have a full plan to further increase the level of integration by adding new chemical chains and capacity to produce new materials and composites of high value.This will minimise the impact of renewables and electricity on transportation fuels. We have the unique advantage, among global players, of being able to pursue this strategy with physical integration at one large site.I am confident that our current business model and planned investments make our hydrocarbon portfolio future-proof with sustained earnings growth.We are committed to strengthening our balance sheet while we pursue growth and realise multiple monetisations.As the earnings from our consumer businesses begin to match those from our hydrocarbon businesses, I assure you that the next decade will truly become a Golden Decade for Reliance.10.    ConclusionFriends,                                                                 Reliance has always been a responsible Corporate Citizen. We know fully that our responsibilities have grown with our opportunities. We shall discharge them with utmost commitment.                               Employment generation for all our youth has become an urgent national imperative. In addition to employing as many as 200,000 people in the last two years alone, Jio and Retail have created indirect livelihood opportunities for 1 million people across India.In all our digital service businesses, data privacy is sacrosanct. Cyber-security is our solemn promise.Our energy and petrochemical businesses follow the philosophy of not only the Green Economy but also the Circular Economy.Because we care for the Environment, which is the most precious asset of mankind.Lastly, ensuring the safety, satisfaction and happiness of our employees is our Dharma, because, for me, all of them are members of the extended Reliance Family.Before I conclude, permit me once again to share with you ─ and with all my dear countrymen ─ a dream I have inherited from my father.It is the dream to see India become an economic superpower. And to see that India becomes a global leader in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. India's prosperity and Reliance's progress have been closely intertwined in every phase of our journey so far. Which is why, Reliance has become a shining icon of Modern India.As India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period.And the creation of societal value by Reliance will be of an even higher order.Old-timers amongst you will recall that whenever our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani spoke of India, there was a surge of patriotic passion in the audience.He always urged us to 'Think big, think fast, think ahead…and, above all, THINK OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO BRIGHTEN INDIA'S FUTURE.'That passion will never subside.As we kick off our Golden Decade with a flourish, we remind ourselves of Reliance's unwavering commitment towards India's Rise.May the God Almighty bless us in our endeavour.11. AcknowledgementsI would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their unanimous support and immense encouragement.I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly for creating and sustaining a world-class enterprise.Thank you.Mukesh D.

The opposition has accused the government of ignoring the state-run defence company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to benefit Anil Ambani. Both the government and the industrialist have rubbished the charge.The new allegations came on a day when Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was headed to France where she will visit a Dassault factory where the 36 Rafale aircraft are being manufactured for India. Ms Sitharaman will also meet her French counterpart, Florence Parly. Sources say Dassault is likely to push for more Rafale jets to be bought by India during the Defence Minister's three-day visit.The previous Congress-led UPA government had negotiated with Dassault for 126 Rafale jets under which 18 jets were to be sent in a fly-away condition and 108 were to be assembled in India by HAL. However, the UPA could not seal the deal.In the new deal, personally negotiated by PM Modi, Anil Ambani's firm became Dassault's key offset partner. As part of the offset clause, Dassault has to ensure that business worth at least half the money -- Rs.30,000 crore -- is generated in India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the procurement of a batch of 36 Rafale jets after holding talks with the then French President Hollande on April 10, 2015 in Paris.New Delhi/Paris: HighlightsPartnership with Reliance a ""trade-off"" for Rafale deal, report claimsDassault said it ""has freely chosen"" to partner with Anil Ambani's firmFrancois Hollande had claimed Indian government proposed Reliance Defencewindow._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'});An internal document of Dassault Aviation, the makers of the Rafale fighters that India is buying from France, shows the aerospace major picking Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as the offset partner in India was a ""trade-off"" for the 36 jet deal, according to a report by French investigative journal Mediapart.The Mediapart article says the document shows a top Dassault official, Loik Segalen had explained to its staff on May 11, 2017, that the joint venture was a ""trade-off"", that was ""imperative and mandatory"" to win the Rafale deal.Dassault Aviation, however, has denied the report and said it ""has freely chosen to make a partnership with India's Reliance Group"". ""This joint-venture, Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL), was created February 10, 2017.

The Sangh was founded on the occasion of Vijyadashmi in 1925, and its chiefs' annual speech has been used to put out the organisation's view on issues of national and social importance.Mr Bhagwat's remarks on defence production assume significance as the BJP-led government is under attack from the Congress over the Rafale fighter jet deal with France.""The country cannot be assured about its security without becoming self-reliant in defence production,"" Mr Bhagwat said.He went on to say, that in order to finally sell its products in the international market, sometimes a country needs to first purchase something from other nation to understand its technology. Buying defence equipment may also be a part of a country's trade strategy, the RSS chief said.""This process of give-and-take in trade should not be stopped. However, it should be on our terms and we should not be dependent on anyone else for our security. We should get technology and enhance our domestic capacity,"" he added.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotNativeVideo""); });Mr Bhagwat said the country is not careless about its security but there is a need to be more active and vigilant.

2018-10-18,"NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani's Reliance Group in a court in Ahmedabad for its reportage on the Rafale fighter jet deal. The hearing has been listed for October 26th and NDTV will argue that the charges of defamation are nothing more than a heavy-handed attempt by Anil Ambani's group to suppress the facts and prevent the media from doing its job - asking questions about a defence deal and seeking answers that are very much in public interest.Remember that just days before this show aired, the role of Reliance appeared to have been questioned by none other than Francois Hollande, who was the president of France when the deal was struck. The NDTV show reported all sides of the story including Dassault's denial that it had been under any pressure to select Reliance. The panellists, in a balanced discussion, examined whether issues like Reliance's vast debt and record in defence manufacturing made it a suitable choice for Dassault in India.As the Rafale deal has become a larger news story in India, the Reliance group has been on a notice-serving spree; to sue a news company for 10,000 crores in a court in Gujarat on false and frivolous charges, ignoring facts that are widely reported everywhere and not just by NDTV, can only be interpreted as an unsophisticated warning to the media to stop doing its job.NDTV outright rejects any charges of defamation and will present material in court to support its case.

2018-10-29,"Reliance Industries, currently country's second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market.Reliance's refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.That began to change when country's oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world's third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country's retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations.This push into the domestic fuel market may stumble after government imposed cost controls on October 4 on petrol and diesel prices to rein in recent record highs.Reliance's shares plunged 6.9 per cent on the day of the announcement and are down about 20 per cent since their record close on August 28.The decline has pushed Reliance's market capitalization down to 6.64 trillion rupees ($90.47 billion) and it is no longer country's most valuable company, sitting behind Tata Consultancy Services Ltd at 6.77 trillion rupees.The price shock, driven by soaring crude import costs, angered consumers and triggered riots by farmers, forcing the government to react at the cost of its refiners' health.For now, Reliance is staying with its retail plans despite the recent trouble.""When prices are cut, you have to effectively match it,"" said Venkatachari Srikanth, Reliance's joint chief financial officer, during their earnings presentation on Oct. 17. ""We are not going to let this alter broadly our strategy on retail petroleum.""The new capacity, combined with soaring crude prices, has eroded profit margins for producing refined fuels.With the domestic market now also under pressure from price controls, some analysts have been spooked.Sukrit Vijayakar, director of oil consultancy Trifecta said the government move could ""be disastrous for Reliance.""Between January and August, Reliance's shares soared 45 per cent, far outpacing the state-owned refiners as well as main stock index, the Nifty 50, which gained 12.5 per cent.But rising crude prices, which jumped from under $70 per barrel in early 2018 to around $85 in early October, and a tumbling rupee combined to push domestic fuel prices to records, undermining Reliance's retail strategy despite some relief from a dip in crude prices in recent weeks.Still, Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president of BOB Capital Markets, which has a buy rating on Reliance, said signs of an ""oil price shock"" in India were ""already visible.""Reliance may be better placed to thrive on exports despite the increasing competition in Asia and the Middle East.The company operates the world's biggest refinery complex at the port of Jamnagar in Gujarat. The first Jamnagar plant can process 663,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude while the second site can process another 709,000 bpd.Reliance's refining margins last quarter were at a premium of $3.40 per barrel over the average Singapore margin, the benchmark for Asia.However, the Singapore margin has dropped by about 50 per cent since mid-2017 because of rising crude prices. Reliance also said in its results that fewer refinery outages last quarter meant global run rates were high.Still, Reliance's refineries benefit from being among the most modern in the world.Several units process residual fuel oil, the leftovers after crude oil is initially refined, into higher-value petrol and distillate products as well as remove pollutants such as sulphur.That ability to cut its high-sulphur fuel oil output to nearly nothing while maximising its diesel fuel output gives Reliance an advantage as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require new low-sulphur fuel oil used in ships starting in 2020.Beyond IMO 2020 and the fuel price turmoil, the oil industry is threatened by the rise of electric vehicles and alternative fuels that could reduce oil's use as a transport fuel.Under Reliance's ""Oil to Chemicals Journey"" strategy the company is seeking to ""upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals"" over the next decade.""We are focusing to produce and sell at every level,"" said Reliance's Srikanth.

The Congress alleges that Dassault chose Reliance Defence as an offset partner despite its inexperience in the field, to bag the Rs 59,000 crore deal. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has accused Dassault of lying.The Congress also accuses the government of deliberately scrapping a deal the previous UPA government had negotiated with Dassault, for 126 Rafale jets under which 18 jets were to be supplied in a fly-away condition and 108 were to be manufactured in India along with state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).Dassault and the government have, however, rubbished Mr Gandhi's allegations. ""We chose Ambani by ourselves. We already have 30 partners other than Reliance,"" Dassault CEO Eric Trappier told news agency ANI.The offset clause means that in exchange for landing the Indian contract, Dassault has to invest half the value of the deal - about 30,000 crores - in Indian firms. Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence was chosen as one of those ""offset"" partners and is to manufacture plane parts - though not for the 36 jets ordered by India.The Rafale deal was announced in 2016 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's talks in Paris with then French president Francois Hollande. The political row over the jet deal escalated sharply after Francois Hollande said in an interview that France had no role in the selection of Anil Ambani's company for the offset clause.Petitions asking for a court-monitored investigation into the deal by former union ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan are being heard by the Supreme Court, which earlier this month asked the government to furnish details of the price in 10 days. The government has, in a sealed cover submitted the pricing details of the jets to the court, but said only experts can launch a review of the deal. Disclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani's Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal.Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.
