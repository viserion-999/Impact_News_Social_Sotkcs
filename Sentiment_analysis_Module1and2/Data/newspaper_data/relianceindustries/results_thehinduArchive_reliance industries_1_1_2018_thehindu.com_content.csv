(RIL) has commissioned the world’s largest off-gas cracker facility at its Jamnagar complex, completing its multi-billion-dollar expansion which has seen it doubling the ethylene capacity and entering the league of the top five petrochemical producers globally.The commissioning of the cracker plant increases RIL’s combined ethylene capacity to close to four million metric tonnes per annum at its five sites.With this, Jamnagar in Gujarat has also become home to the world’s largest operating refinery off-gas cracker, RIL said in a statement. The oil major also runs the world’s largest single location petroleum refinery at Jamnagar with a 60-million-tonne annual capacity.Commissioning of the ethylene plant integrates feedstock with the two refineries nearby, thus providing sustainable cost advantage to RIL over its global peers.“The world’s first ROGC and downstream plants marks a paradigm shift in profitability and sustainability of our petchem business as the complex deeply integrates our feedstock, reducing cost massively,” chairman Mukesh Ambani was quoted as saying. “This expansion once again showcases our competitive advantage in efficient execution of complex projects.”According to RIL, the facility is the world’s first ever and the largest refinery off-gas cracker complex of 1.5 mmtpa capacity along with downstream plants and utilities. “This is the largest ever expansion of RIL’s petrochemicals portfolio, and is also the last leg of the multi-billion dollar capex cycle, which was also one the largest capex programmes globally in the sector in recent times,” it said.In 2014, the company had announced a $16 billion capex plan at Jamnagar.Ethylene from the ROGC is used in downstream plants to produce mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) and polyethylene.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:08 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ril-raises-ethylene-capacity-twofold/article22353673.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-01-26,"India’s most indebted firm Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), with outstanding loans of ₹2.13 lakh crore, plans to deleverage as it nears the completion of its ₹3 lakh-crore capital expenditure cycle.“If you look at the way our earnings are shaping up, across hydrocarbons, across Jio, across retail, we will have enough free cash flow,” V. Srikanth, joint CFO, RIL, told The Hindu.“We are earning a lot and our earnings are going to be way bigger in coming quarters. This quarter is just the beginning, which does not even factor in refinery off-gas cracker’s (ROGC) full capability,” he said.“We are talking about ROGC full capability in the next quarter and then gasification economics coming in a big way in the next quarter and there will be sequential growth. So, cash flows are going to be much stronger in the next financial year and a positive free cash flow by definition means that your level of debt will only be coming down.”However, with Moody’s Investors Service estimating that Reliance Jio likely to invest as much as $23 billion over three to four years as it expands beyond wireless services, a significant reduction in RIL’s debt may take longer to achieve.The company is also set to invest about $4 billion in acquiring telecom assets of Reliance Communications.Queried about the Moody’s report projecting the $23 billion investment, Mr. Srikanth said, “Moody’s report is a bit of a surprise. My understanding is that they have ticketed $15 billion to $23 billion. The way Moody’s looks at cash flow, if you have to pay suppliers 12 months from now, it’s included. When you look to pay suppliers, that number itself is going to be $12-13 billion. Even if you look at whatever set of numbers we need to continue to grow, we will have enough positive cash flows.”RIL’s outstanding debt as on December 31, 2017, stood at ₹2,13,206 crore ($33.4 billion) compared with ₹1,96,601 crore as on March 31, 2017.

2018-02-27,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is aiming to cover 99 per cent of the country’s population by this Diwali, said a top company official.As part of its expansion plans, Jio has announced the roll-out of Internet of Things (IoT) services in association with Samsung, which will help consumers and enterprises.“We are deploying around 8,000 to 10,000 towers every month,” said Reliance Jio Infocomm President Jyotindra Thacker.He is hopeful that by September or October (Diwali), the company would reach a coverage of 99 per cent. At present, the company has a subscriber base of 160 million paid customers.Reliance Jio Tareq Amin Senior VP Technology Tareq Amin said: “We talked about acquiring 100 million customers in 170 days last year, which was unprecedented. People really doubted our ability to convert from free to paid customers. Not only have we converted that, we have largest migration of free to paid services in history. Our network today has 160 million paid subscribers in less than 16 months of operation.”Through its IoT services, Jio aims to work with the sectors like transportation, weather forecasting and agriculture. It is also exploring the possibility of working with third party developers on IoT.On being asked about as how much time Jio would take to roll out IoT, Mr. Amin said, the company needs to create an entire ecosystem for that. Rather than of doing city-by-city launch, we would launch IoT always pan India. We are not waiting for network readiness, but we are awaiting maturity of the IoT platform, he said.Mr. Amin further said the Jio’s network would surpass 2G coverage. Our coverage in LTE would surpass 2G coverage. “We want to connect every person and every village,” Mr. Amin added.“India ranked 154th in the world in mobile internet penetration and today it is number one in the data consumption. We believe that today we have the largest data consumption network in the world and largest video consumption network in the world,” said Mr. Amin at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018.About switching of Jio’s network from 4G to 5G, he said that it could be done by software upgrade, only saying that it was a network built for the future. “For any network in this world, this migration would be a forklift activity. It’s a nightmare,” he said.In Jio network architecture, “we built this software defining network from day zero,” he added. Jio Infocomm, which has already introduced IoT services in Mumbai, now has plans to roll out pan India. On Monday, Jio Infocomm and Samsung Electronics had announced to work together to set up a nationwide IoT network.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:24 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/reliance-jio-to-cover-99-population-by-diwali-official/article22865811.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-03-07,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to pay ₹3,502.62 crore to Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited, which was operating the airport express line earlier.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva upheld DAMEPL’s plea for payment of 75% of the arbitral award in its favour to pay off project lenders and promoters, who had financed the project.The court also dismissed the DMRC’s plea challenging the Arbitral Tribunal’s May 2017 decision asking it to make payments to DAMEPL for breach of its obligations under the Concession Agreement to cure defects in the civil structure of the Airport Metro Line within the ‘cure period’.The HC verdict stated: “DAMEPL has sought direction for release of deposited amount to project lenders and promoters who had financed the project. The prayer is allowed... However, instead of depositing the said amount in court, the Delhi Metro is directed to deposit the amount along with interest, as awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal, directly with the project lenders. The said amount be deposited in the escrow account maintained with the project lenders, within a period of four weeks from today.”The 23-km-long Airport Metro Express Line, which runs between New Delhi and Dwarka, started off as a Public Private Partnership between the Delhi Metro and DAMEPL.The land was acquired by the DMRC and all basic civil structures were constructed by it. Balance systems such as track, signalling, electrification, and rolling stock were to be implemented by the private partner.DAMEPL had said that during the course of operation of the project, it noticed various defects in the works performed by the Delhi Metro. It is contended that the defects severely impaired the performance of the obligations under the Concession Agreement.DAMEPL said it terminated the concession agreement as the DMRC had not cured some defects in the express line within 90 days of the notice issued by it. After handling over the line to the Delhi Metro on July 1, 2013, DAMEPL asked the DMRC to give the Termination Payment as per the Concession Agreement. After efforts to amicably resolve the issues did not yield results, both parties went into arbitration.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:28 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dmrc-told-to-pay-reliance-3500-crore/article22954160.ece© The HinduHC awarded another ₹9 lakh to luxury brand for expenses incurred in fighting caseState unit kept out of Amit Shah-directed exerciseAlready a user?

2018-03-11,"Reliance Foundation, one of the largest private foundations in the country, plans to set up a university for cutting edge research and innovation as well as nurturing future leaders, musicians, scientists and Olympians, said its founder-chairperson Nita Ambani.Speaking at the India Today Conclave last evening, she said sports and education are the two pillars on which ‘India tomorrow’ will rise.With her husband Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director, in the audience, she delivered a talk titled ‘The Great Equaliser: Sports and Education For All.’“Even the world’s best and biggest companies have a finite lifespan. But educational institutions are timeless. They live and breathe and grow in the generations whom they empower,” she said.And that is why, Reliance Foundation is planning to set up a world-class university, she said.“A university at the cutting edge of research and innovation. A university that focuses on education and sports, art and culture,” she said without giving a timeline for setting up of the institution.The university, she said, will collaborate with the top universities around the world and prepare future generations to face the world, with knowledge and skills.“A university from the gates of which will emerge our future leaders, our musicians, our scientists, and our Olympians,” she said. “Building such a university is our dream at Reliance Foundation.”Reliance Foundation was set up in 2010 to provide impetus to various philanthropic initiatives of Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest private firm.Ambani said India is home to one sixth of humanity and half of its population is under the age of 25.“One-fifth of all young people in the world are Indians. In the next two decades, while the world ages, India is poised to become younger. India’s youth will build India’s tomorrow,” she said. “Mukesh and I have a big dream and a firm commitment - To make the Right Education, and the Right to Education available to all.”Ambani went on to detail her organisation’s efforts to contribute to the development of sports and education in India.Reliance Foundation has established 14 schools, educating over 16,000 children annually.“Our newest two schools are in Uttarakhand. These are the schools that were completely destroyed during the floods in Uttarakhand in 2013, which we have rebuilt now,” she said.Stating that scarcity of quality teachers and the lack of infrastructure continue to be India’s major challenges, she said creative and quality content as well as innovative and cost-effective methods are the need of the hour.Her foundation’s grassroots programme had reached out to 13 million budding sports persons and athletes, she said narrating inspiring stories of young boys and girls who dared to dream and succeeded.She spoke of Anju Gurjar, a young athlete who received a marriage proposal at the age of 15, but won a competition held by the Reliance Foundation and then went on to compete at the national level.She also spoke of the Pandya brothers, Kunal and Hardik (of Mumbai Indians fame), and their humble beginnings.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:30 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/education/reliance-foundation-to-set-up-a-university-nita-ambani/article23039473.ece© The HinduHere’s how you can simultaneously prepare for both NEET and the board examsAlready a user?

2018-04-05,"A day after Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam raised questions over the ‘pricey’ deal between Reliance Infrastructure Limited and Adani Transmission Limited, the former served a defamation notice for ₹1,000 crore on the Congress leader on Wednesday.“Reliance Group is moving a contempt petition against Mr. Nirupam before the Bombay High Court. On April 3, he made several false, frivolous and baseless allegations, and defamatory statements, in relation to the proposed sale of Reliance Infrastructure’s integrated Mumbai power business to Adani Transmission Ltd., and linked the sale with the purchase of Rafale fighter aircraft by the government of India from France,” a press release issued by RInfra said.Mr. Nirupam said though he has not received the notice, he welcomes the decision by RInfra. “Now let everything get discussed in the court, including the deal in question. Even the court can scrutinise the deal, which according to me is shady.”RInfra on December 2017 announced the sale of its Mumbai power business to Adani at an estimated value of ₹18,000 crore. The deal is with the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission for approval. If the deal goes through, it will ensure that RInfra becomes debt-free and has a cash surplus of ₹3,000 crore.“In its valuation report by M/s SSPA & Co, submitted to the High Court last year, it valued the generation, transmission, distribution business of RInfra at ₹5,575 crore. Why is Adani paying RInfra ₹12,425 crore more than the valuation of its Mumbai power business? As per the data available, Adani power itself has a debt of ₹47,609 crore. Why is the company not repaying its loan and instead buying RInfra?” Mr. Nirupam had asked, claiming it would lead to hike in the power tariffs.The Reliance Group has asked Mr. Nirupam to immediately withdraw and apologise for the statements within 72 hours from the receipt of the notice, and desist from making such statements concerning the company without ascertaining the facts.“An order passed by the HC in suit no.113 of 2014, filed by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, is subsisting against Mr. Nirupam, which restrains him from making defamatory statements. Despite the orders, Mr. Nirupam has chosen to brazenly and in sheer contempt of the court make such irresponsible, false and defamatory statements,” the release said.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:33 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/reliance-files-1000-cr-defamation-suit-against-sanjay-nirupam/article23437885.ece© The HinduTwo of the three accused in custody are civic body officialsAlready a user?

2018-04-19,"BP and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) have announced the sanctioning of the ‘Satellite cluster’ project in Block KG D6.The ‘Satellite cluster’ is the second of three projects in the Block KG D6 integrated development, the companies said in a statement.Together, the three projects will develop a total of about 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources with a total investment of ₹40,000 crore ($6 billion). They are expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of a day new domestic gas production onstream, phased over 2020-2022.According to the statement, companies are moving forward to develop the Block’s discovered deep-water gas fields in an integrated series of projects, bringing new gas production for India.The first of the projects, development of the ‘R-Series’ deep-water gas fields, was sanctioned in June 2017.Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL, said: “In consonance with our announcements last year to raise domestic gas production, we are delighted to announce the on-schedule progress of the Satellite cluster in the east coast of India. This development supports the country’s imminent need of increasing domestic gas supply and is a firm step towards making India a gas-based economy.”Speaking in London on Thursday, Bob Dudley, BP Group Chief Executive, welcomed the investment decision: “This latest investment is a further demonstration of BP’s commitment to India. Through our partnership, Reliance and BP are able to develop these discovered gas resources efficiently and economically, working closely with the Government of India. These new developments will produce much needed energy for India’s thriving economy.”According to the companies, Satellites cluster is a dry gas development and comprises four discoveries with five well sub-sea development in 1700 metres water depth, up to 15 kilometres east and southeast of the producing D1D3 fields in KG D6.India today consumes over 5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas and aspires to double gas consumption by 2022.Gas production from the integrated development is expected to help reduce India’s import dependence and amount to over 10% of the country’s projected gas demand in 2022, benefiting India and domestic consumers at large, the companies noted.In 2011, BP took a 30% stake in multiple oil and gas blocks in India operated by RIL, including the producing Block KGD6. Block KGD6 participating interests are 60% RIL (operator), 30% BP and 10% NIKO.Since formation of this partnership in 2011, the two companies have invested around ₹13,000 crore ($2 billion) in deep-water exploration and production to date.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:39 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bp-ril-announce-sanctioning-of-satellite-cluster-project-in-kgd6-block/article23601792.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-04-24,"The auditors of Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited (formerly Reliance Defence and Engineering Limited) have questioned the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.Presenting their report on the financial results of the company, the auditors represented by Pathak H.D. & Associates Chartered Accountants expressed their doubt on the claims made by the management and felt that the conditions as elucidated by the management ``indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as going concern''.The auditors drew attention to the Note no. 3 to the statement regarding preparation of standalone financial results of the company on a going concern basis and also recognition of deferred tax assets (DTA) on tax losses despite the fact that the company has been incurring cash losses, its net worth has been substantially eroded as on 31st March, 2018, loans have been called back by secured lenders, current liabilities are substantially higher than current assets, applications have been made to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Ahmedabad, under Section 9 of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code 2016 and winding up petitions have been filed before the Gujarat High Court for recovery of their dues by a few operating creditors.``The company is also of the view that no impairment of its non-current assets is required. These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as going concern. The appropriateness of assumption of going concern, recognition of DTA and evaluation of recoverable value of its non-current assets is critically dependent upon the approval of company's resolution plan by the secured lenders, the company's ability to raise requisite finance/generate cash flows in future to meet its obligations and to earn profits in future, the note by the auditors said.The auditors also referred to the note no. 6(a) to the statement regarding applications under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 against the company as a corporate guarantor for the loans taken by Reliance Marine and Offshore Limited (RMOL), a wholly-owned subsidiary. ``The management is of the view that the value of securities available in RMOL is sufficient to recover the outstanding dues of IFCI Limited. Accordingly, no provision against the claim under the invoked corporate guarantee is considered necessary. Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters,'' the auditors said.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:43 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/auditors-doubt-reliance-navals-ability-to-continue-as-a-going-concern/article23655498.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-04-26,"Reliance Jio plans to recruit 75,000-80,000 people during the current fiscal, said a senior official.A good chunk of the new recruits will be freshers, said Sanjay Jog, chief human resources officer. He disclosed that a little more than 1.50 lakh people were on the rolls now.For reaching out to the prospective candidates, the company would bank on its partnerships with about 6,000 colleges across the country as well as employee referrals as it looked to attract talent from smaller towns.“These are technical colleges, graduate colleges, ITIs... where we have encouraged people to come and work for us during [their] summer [vacation],” he said on the sidelines of a Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) conference here on Thursday.On attrition rate, he said it was 32% in sales and technical areas. “If you look at headquarters, it is 2%. On an average... it will come down to 18%,” he added. To a query, he said the average attrition rate in the telecom industry used to be 20-22%.On training for new recruits, Mr.Jog said the emphasis was on making sure that when a person was appointed, he should be ready to start working in 24 hours. Much of the training is thus imparted online before the candidates actually join the firm. The company was working with the colleges to embed a course towards making the candidates ‘Reliance ready.’The hiring decision was driven by Reliance Jio’s objective of covering 99% of the population by Diwali and its plan to unveil more products.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:51:47 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/reliance-jio-to-hire-up-to-80000/article23686767.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-06-07,"Reliance Industries Ltd. aims to make its consumer businesses as big as its core energy operations, chairman Mukesh Ambani said in its annual report, as he seeks to reshape the industrial powerhouse.The company, primarily an oil and gas refining, marketing and petrochemicals conglomerate, counts telecoms, retail and media and entertainment as part of its consumer businesses that together contribute barely a tenth of total operating profit. However, buoyed by the success of Reliance’s fledgling telecoms start-up Jio, which turned a profit within a year of operation, Mr. Ambani is hoping to see rapid growth from the consumer divisions in future. “Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade,” he said in a letter to shareholders in the annual report. “The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold, wherefrom they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits,” he said.RIL also said it was banking on emerging technologies for the next wave of growth. Following the completion of the world’s largest capital expenditure cycle over five years at its Jamnagar refinery at a cost of more than ₹1.5 lakh crore, RIL has identified artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, IIoT, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual reality as the set of next ‘big opportunities’.RIL is exploring collaborations with industry leaders such as GE, Honeywell, Siemens, Emerson, Schneider Electric, among others, to build foundation blocks for its long-term Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) strategy and the digital manufacturing platform, according to the annual report.“RIL is piloting the use of virtual reality to increase safety and reliability through a virtual walk-through plant environment for interactive training, testing and process simulation for all crucial personnel,” Mr. Ambani said.RIL will hold its 41st AGM in Mumbai on July 5, where shareholders will vote to reappoint Mr. Ambani as MD for five years.

2018-06-22,"Vice-Admiral Karambir Singh, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command on Thursday said MSME sector would be benefited due the Indian Navy’s efforts to achieve self-reliance.He was speaking at a seminar conducted jointly by Confederation of Indian Industry, Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers and A.P. Economic Development Board on opportunities in defence and aerospace for the industry.Stating that Navy had been nurturing shipbuilding since 1960s, he said at present 32 ships and submarines and several light combat aircraft had been ordered for construction.As shipbuilding ancillary industry largely consisted of MSMEs, they had a big role to play in indigenisation programme of the defence forces. Fifty one of 91 contracts worth ₹57,000 crore had been awarded to domestic vendors.Admitting that they were dependent on imports for high-end components required for the defence industry, he said R&D efforts should be stepped up to improve technology. He referred to the ‘Make in India’ campaign and declared Navy’s full support to encourage domestic industry in getting orders from them.Explaining the Navy’s expectation, Vice-Admiral Singh said quality was of utmost importance as they could not afford to compromise on this aspect. “Any chinks in the armoury will be exploited ruthlessly by the enemy,” he said.He observed that seeking protectionism would be self-defeating in the long run for the domestic industry and called for developing cutting-edge technologies and encouraging collaborative efforts for transfer of technologies.Vice-Admiral Singh said the Navy was not only the platform and that technologies operated in six dimensions such as air, sea, underwater, land, cyber and space. “This opens up a host of the opportunities for the industry. He reiterated that Navy’s roadmap for the future would remain anchored firmly on self-reliance and indigenisation.Lt. Gen.

2018-06-28,"The Tribal Welfare Department’s ambitious Driver Empowerment Programme appears to have opened up new opportunities for some of the unemployed tribal youth in the district to explore new vistas in pursuit of financial self-reliance.The Tribal Welfare Department recently selected 37 beneficiaries from tribal communities based on an interview for the Driver Empowerment Programme/Driver cum Owner Scheme.The scheme envisages provision of financial assistance to the eligible unemployed tribal youth to purchase new cars on subsidy and become full-time commercial drivers, according to sources in the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam.Though launched a few years ago as part of a State-wide initiative to empower young drivers of weaker sections, the scheme gained momentum in the Agency areas in the recent past.The implementation agencies concerned have reportedly tied up with a multinational taxi-aggregator to provide placement assistance to the beneficiaries of the scheme, the sources added.The Tribal Welfare Department recently handed over brand new cars worth a little over ₹1 crore to as many as 14 unemployed tribal youths in the first phase for the financial year 2017-18.Some of the beneficiaries rented out their vehicles to various government departments and private companies to augment their income, and to make monthly payments towards bank loan instalments and over a period of time, become the owners of the vehicles.Two of the beneficiaries have enrolled their vehicles with a Hyderabad-based global cab services firm to operate them as taxis, the sources added.“The scheme came as a big boon for me in terms of securing a sustained source of income,” says Lakavath Ramakrishna of Burgampadu mandal, who rented out his brand new car to “Bhavitha”, the livelihood support wing of the ITDA on a monthly rental of ₹33,000.“I had spent ₹50,000 towards beneficiary contribution of the Driver cum Owner scheme which allowed me to take possession of a brand new car worth about ₹7.40 lakh. I will strive to make the best use of the car to support my family financially,” he says with confidence.“I will pursue opportunities to become a full-time driver in government departments or start an enterprising venture to provide employment to other unemployed drivers in the near future,” the tribal youth unveils his plans.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:25 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/driving-home-the-message-of-self-reliance/article24281765.ece© The HinduRevised prices kicked into effect on Mar. 8; eye on pharmacies, wholesale outletsIT Grids got ‘illegal’ access to Andhra Pradesh citizens’ personal dataAlready a user?

2018-07-05,"After disrupting the Indian mobile telephony space, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio aims to disrupt the broadband and D2H market with the unveiling of JioGigaFiber, its fibre broadband system.The roll-out would happen across 1,100 cities simultaneously starting August 15, he said. Mentioning that India was ranked 134 in the global ranking for fixed broadband, he said Jio was determined to move the country to among the top five.“JioGigaFiber for the home would mean ultra high definition entertainment on television, multi-party video conferencing from the comfort of your living room, voice-activated virtual assistants, who obey your every command, virtual gaming reality and digital shopping where you are magically transported into a digital universe of immersive experiences, smart home solutions, where hundreds of devices like security cameras, home appliances, even lights and switches can be securely controlled by their owners using a smartphone, from both inside and outside the home,” said Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani while addressing the shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM) of the company.“This will redefine 24X7 emergency help for all homes,” he said.Stocks of cable operators and D2H firms like Hathway and DenNetworks touched a 52-week low after Mr. Ambani’s announcement that JioGigaFiber would come with routers and set-top box for television.Starting July 21, RIL’s telecom arm Reliance Jio will offer Jio phones for ₹501 in exchange for feature phones. The company is banking on 500 million feature phone users, who cannot use the Internet, to become JioPhone users. Reliance Jio plans to offer popular apps such as YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook on Jio phones from August 15. The company also plans to introduce JioPhone2, an upgraded version of JioPhones, from August 15 for ₹2999.The company had 25 million JioPhone users in India and aims to achieve more than 100 million JioPhone users in the shortest possible time. Bridging gap with Vodafone and Idea cellular, Reliance Jio added 215 million customers.“Since I last spoke, we have doubled our customer base to over 215 million now. [As many as] 215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world,” he said.Moving away from its core business of refining and petroleum, Reliance Industries is transitioning itself into a technology platform company as the consumer facing businesses of Reliance are likely to become as big as energy business in the coming years. The company plans to integrate physical retail stores with digital platform of Reliance Jio to create a hybrid online-to-offline commerce platform. “We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail’s physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio’s digital infrastructure and services.“This platform will bring together 35 crore and growing customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores, 21.5 crore and growing Jio connectivity customers and the targeted five crore JioGiga-homes,” said Mr. Ambani.Investment advisor S P Tulsian believes combination of Jio with retail and refinery with petrochemicals is going to create wonders for the company. “Both initiative will deliver big value to the company. The company is banking on e-commerce in a big way. I never expected that Jio would lead to such an explosion in data. The IPO of Retail and Jio should happen in 24 months as both the managements would like to bring IPO at higher valuation. Post IPO, the market cap of Reliance should double.” Mr. Tulsian told The Hindu.RIL shares closed 2.5% lower at ₹965 as investors expected Reliance to announce listing of Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:29 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ril-primes-broadband-disruption-via-jio-fibre/article24343252.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

Gopalaswami.The proposed university is required to start academic operations within three years, and has, as per the MHRD, already purchased 800 acres at Karjat near Navi Mumbai.This clarification comes in the wake of widespread criticism on the social media. JNU professor Ayesha Kidwai suggested, tongue-in-cheek, that it was a case of absence of use of spell check, since “the state or fact of being about to happen” meant imminence, not eminence.Also ReadSix universities, including Jio Institute, to be ‘institutions of eminence’“The committee in their wisdom and after exercising due diligence, after speaking to them, after reading their proposals, after looking at their vision statements and their ability to mobilise land, building and core team found only one institution to be eligible. We are respecting their judgment,” said Higher Education Secretary R. Subrahmanyam.“This committee consists of very reputed persons, people with impeccable integrity, with a lot of public service. They are all eminent personalities. That being so, we are convinced that they have done a very thorough job,” he said.There were three categories under which institutions could apply: the public institutions, the already existing private institutions and the greenfield institutions, meaning private institutions that were found very promising at proposal stage. Twenty-nine existing private institutions had applied and 11 applications came in the greenfield category. While the Manipal Academy of Higher Education and BITS Pilani were selected in the private institutions category, the proposed Jio Institute alone was selected in the greenfield category, Mr. Subrahmanyam said.The IISc Bengaluru, the IIT-Bombay and the IIT-Delhi were selected in the category of public institutions.Letters of intent would be issued to institutions in the greenfield category and they would be required to start academic operations within three years for the IoE (institute of eminence) status to become operational.

In August 2017, a gang of serial offenders with 24 cases against them were booked under the law. In a case registered in July 2017 by Kandivali police, a remote control system was used to steal power worth ₹7.5 lakh.DCP (Zone VI) Shahaji Umap said, “Power theft is high in our area, and we have been cracking down along with service providers. Charge sheets are filed as soon as possible so that the accused face punitive action.” Chembur, Shivaji Nagar and Mankhurd police stations, which fall in Mr. Umap’s zone, registered power theft cases in 2017-18.A Reliance spokesperson said power demand in slums is not met due to overloading of the network due to power theft. “Ten lakh out of our 30 lakh customers reside in slums, and Reliance is unable to install new towers due to power constraints. making the crackdown on power theft essential.”Most FIRs were registered in the Kurla-Mankhurd-Vikhroli stretch — 63 against 333 accused.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:40 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/66-spike-in-power-theft-reliance/article24422868.ece© The HinduTwo of the three accused in custody are civic body officialsAlready a user?

2018-07-21,"Till recently, Urmila Sawant (42), a resident of Kolgaon village in Sawantwadi, worked as a domestic help, earning about ₹2,000 a month. In 2016, she got an opportunity to be a part of a group of 30 women from eight self-help groups (SHGs) trained to become catering entrepreneurs and serve meals to Konkan Railway commuters in trains that halt at Sawantwadi. Today, Ms. Sawant feels like she has a respectable job. “It seems like I have a government job. People look at me very differently now,” she says.The Sawantwadi e-catering model that changed the lives of women like Ms. Sawant is being replicated at other stations. It was adopted in Ratnagiri last year, and Miraj junction will start the service in two months.The Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) e-catering option allows commuters to pre-book meals, either while planning their trip or two hours before the halt at a particular station. Commuters can order meals from IRCTC’s pantries or other authorised food joints. At Sawantwadi, travellers can order from Maher Lok Sanchalit Sadhan Kendra, the kitchen run by the women from SHGs. They offer hygienically-cooked Malvani delicacies such as ukadiche modak, ghavane chatni, solkadi and many chicken and fish dishes.The initiative, spearheaded by the State government’s Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal (MAVIM), was financially backed by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. The Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation (LHWRF) provided the skill training. “From December 2016 to January this year, the pilot model in Sawantwadi has had a turnover of ₹6 lakh,” said MAVIM’s regional monitoring and evolution officer Mangesh Suryawanshi.“Sawantwadi station has only 10 train halts. These women have now ventured out to cater for weddings, anniversary functions and other events to generate more revenue,” he said. At Ratnagiri, on the other hand, the women bring in a turnover of about ₹10 lakh in a year as 25 to 30 trains halt at the station each day.Since December 2016, the women from Sawantwadi have delivered more than 300 meals. The vegetarian food starts at ₹75 while non-vegetarian meals start at ₹160, going up to ₹500. “At times, we may get only one order a day but we do also get bulk orders,” said Reshma Bhingare, a catering entrepreneur from Sawantwadi. The three-month training through LHWRF equipped her with skills in packaging, hygiene, usage of ingredients in bulk food orders.Trainers were called in from Taj Vivanta, Goa. The Sawantwadi women trained their counterparts in Ratnagiri and both the groups will now train the six women selected from SHGs in Miraj.“We believe that jobs should reach people. They should not have to go out looking for jobs. The women involved in the e-catering programme earlier helped their husbands in farms or did house work. Today, they are extremely confident and it reflects in their approach,” said LHWRF’s Executive Director Sita Ram Gupta.Part of the confidence comes from an increase in earnings. Ms. Sawant now makes about ₹4,000, while Ms. Bhingare makes ₹5,000. On good days, they could bring in much more.The writer was in Sawantwadi at the invitation of Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:41 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/self-reliance-on-wheels/article24484669.ece© The HinduThe Commission, among other issues, is learnt to have asked about details of the launch of the channel.Study claims poor air quality caused 1.2 mn deaths each in India and China in 2017Already a user?

2018-07-27,"Reliance Industries (RIL) reported a 17.9% increase in its first quarter net profit to ₹9,459 crore led by a 33% growth in volumes and significant margin improvement in the petrochemicals business that offset the fall in gross refining margins (GRMs).The GRM (which is the difference between the cost of sourcing crude and finished products) for the first quarter ended June, stood at $10.5 per barrel compared with $11.9 per barrel a year earlier.RIL’s revenue increased 56.5% to ₹141,699 crore on account of higher realisation for refining and petrochemical products led by a 49% increase in brent oil price.“Our consumer businesses continue to scale new highs and now account for nearly 21% of consolidated segment Ebitda,” RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said. “Retail business revenues have more than doubled and Ebitda has trebled on a year-on-year basis. The scalability of our consumer business platforms is driving unprecedented value generation for our customers, our country and our shareholders.”RIL’s depreciation (including depletion and amortisation) increased to ₹5,173 crore compared with ₹3,037 crore a year earlier, primarily on account of investments in telecom unit Jio’s wireless telecommunication network and due to capitalisation of projects in the petrochemicals business during the previous period, the company said in a statement.Finance costs rose threefold to ₹3,550 crore on account of commencement of petrochemical projects at Jamnagar and the digital services business. Higher loan balances and exchange rate variation also contributed to the increase in finance costs, the statement added.RIL’s outstanding debt increased to ₹242,116 crore as on June 30, compared with ₹218,763 crore as on March 31, 2018, while cash and cash equivalents increased at a slower pace to ₹79,492 crore compared with ₹78,063 crore a quarter earlier.Reliance Jio reported a 20% rise in net profit to ₹612 crore on revenues of ₹9,567 crore. It had 215.3 million customers as on June 30, making it the third-largest telco after the Vodafone-Idea combine (a proposed merger which is close to getting necessary regulatory approvals) and Bharti Airtel.“Strong growth in consumer [count] and increase in profitability in Jio [helped] counterbalance the dip in GRM,” Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research, IIFL Securities, said.“Pet coke gasification is likely to lead to a rebound in GRM by the end of FY19. Overall, we expect RIL to continue to report robust growth driven by e-commerce play in retail, fuller utilisation of large investments in the petrochemical segment and rise in revenue market share to 43% for Jio in FY2022.”RIL shares rose 1.73% to ₹1,129.6 on the BSE in a firm market on Friday.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:42 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/reliance-reports-record-quarterly-net-profit-of-9459-cr-in-q1/article24533091.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-07-28,"Keeping up the pressure on the Modi government over the Rafale deal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said Indian taxpayers would have to pay “Mr. 56 inch friend’s joint venture ₹1 lakh crore over five decades to maintain the aircraft”.The “Mr 56 inch” is a not-so-subtle reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who used to refer to himself as such in election rallies in the run-up to the 2014 elections.“Over the next 50 years, Indian taxpayers will pay Mr 56’s friend’s JV, (₹) 100,000 crore to maintain 36 #RafaleScam jets, India is buying. Raksha Mantri will address a press conference to deny this, as usual. But the truth is in the presentation I’m attaching,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted and tagged a document from a Reliance Infrastructure Investors presentation.The presentation mentions that Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd. (DRAL), the joint venture company between French Dassault Aviation and Anil Ambani-owned Reliance group, has secured the offset contract from Dassault Aviation for ₹30,000 crore and the consequent “lifecycle opportunity” is estimated at ₹1 lakh crore over 50 years.”On Friday, the Congress released a set of documents to allege that the Modi government had violated rules and changed norms to ensure that the renegotiated Rafale deal benefited the Reliance group.It had accused Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of being untruthful about Reliance Defence getting the Rafale deal’s offset contract from its French maker Dassault Aviation.Apart from planning to strongly raise it in Parliament, the Congress has planned protests on the issue across the country.“If you are giving such a big defence contract, would you not see their track record. Reliance Naval Engineering (formerly Reliance Defence) has an outstanding loan of ₹9,000 crore from government owned IFCI and the matter has now gone to the National Company Law Tribunal. They had to make boats for the Navy and coastal security but they couldn’t fulfil the contract,” senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil told presspersons at a briefing on Saturday.He said Reliance Naval, based at Pipavav, had neither paid its vendors nor its employees and there had been a strike for the past three months in the port town. “Such companies should be blacklisted and you are giving them the Rafale contract,” he said.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:44 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/taxpayers-will-have-to-pay-reliance-for-50-years-says-rahul-gandhi/article24542597.ece© The HinduIn this new podcast series tracking major campaign speeches across the country, Varghese K George is in conversation with Jayant Sriram toAlready a user?

2018-08-02,"Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) is planning to merge its loss-making U.S. shale operations and Indian exploration and production (E&P) business to achieve synergies. The move comes at a time when the company is shifting focus towards profitable and scalable consumer businesses.Confirming the development, V. Srikanth, joint CFO, RIL, said, “We have submitted an application to RBI for cross-border merger to achieve synergies through integration of resources with Indian E&P business. RIL board will consider the proposal for amalgamation upon receipt of approval of RBI.”RIL’s revenues from domestic E&P operations stood at ₹754 crore, with a negative EBIT of ₹245 crore for the June quarter. Revenues from U.S. shale gas operations stood at ₹678 crore with a negative EBIT of ₹199 crore for the June quarter.However, Paras Bothra, head of equity research at Ashika Stock Broking, said, “Merging of U.S. shale gas subsidiary with the parent is going to have an insignificant impact.” “Moreover, RIL doesn’t seem to have any great interest on shale gas and the real focus is on telecom, retail, and its existing refining/petro chem business, which investors are keenly watching and are the real big value drivers for RIL shareholders,” he added.Oil and gas contributed to revenues of ₹5,204 crore and loss of ₹1,536 crore for FY18. At peak, oil and gas contributed to revenues of ₹12,649 crore, accounting for 5.5% of total revenues and EBIT of ₹5,413 crore.Oil and gas was expected to be a significant contributor to RIL’s earnings and cash flows, but falling gas production in KG Basin and declining shale gas prices in U.S. made the segment the least contributor to RIL’s top line and bottom line, whileconsumer businesses now contribute to 21% of the company’s EBITDA.RIL shares declined 1.91% on the BSE to close at ₹1,168.35 in a weak Mumbai market on Thursday.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:50 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/ril-plans-to-merge-us-shale-business-india-ep-operations/article24585108.ece© The HinduCurtailed operation cannot support overheadsAlready a user?

2018-08-27,"Faced with plunging U.S. orders, surgical glove maker Ren Jiding is hunting for new markets amid Chinese government calls to reduce reliance on the United States. But none can absorb the 60 percent of his sales that went to American customers last year.“Other countries import much less than the United States,” said Ren, a co-owner of Hongyeshangqin Medical Science and Technology Co., Ltd. in the eastern city of Zibo.From medical products to smartphone chips to soybeans, Beijing is responding to President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes by pushing companies to trade more with other countries. But there are few substitutes for the United States as an export market and source of technology for industries including telecom equipment makers Chinese leaders are eager to develop.Beijing has announced tariff cuts and other changes while rejecting U.S. demands to scale back plans such as “Made in China 2025,” which calls for state-led creation of Chinese champions in robotics, biotech and other fields. American leaders say those violate Beijing’s market-opening promises and might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The response highlights the cost the ruling Communist Party is willing to pay in lost sales and jobs to stick to plans that are fueling conflict with Washington, Europe and other trading partners.“China sees its technology and industrial policies as fundamental to its growth,” Tianjie He of Oxford Economics said in an email. “It is thus hard to see China’s leadership committing to significant changes.”Mr. Trump has raised duties on a total of $50 billion of Chinese imports including ultrasound scanners and industrial components that Washington says benefit from improper policies. China retaliated with similar penalties.The U.S. is poised to raise duties on $200 billion of imports including the gloves made by Ren’s company. Beijing has issued a list of American goods for retaliation.The impact on China is “small and is containable, at least for the time being,” said Vincent Chan of Credit Suisse. He said the “worst case” outlook if all threatened U.S. tariff hikes go ahead would cut China’s growth by 0.2 percentage points this year and 1.3 percent in 2019.Chinese leaders have tried to cushion the blow to their own economy by targeting American goods its importers can get from other countries soybeans from Brazil, gas from Russia, cars from Germany and fish from Vietnam.Beijing has promised to use revenue from the higher tariffs to help struggling exporters and has ordered banks to lend more freely to them.The biggest jolt so far came from Beijing’s cancellation of orders for soybeans, the biggest American export to China at $21 billion last year. That hammered farm states that voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. It also pushed up prices for Chinese farmers that use soybeans for animal feed and food processors that crush them for cooking oil.That could be a windfall for Brazil. But China already is its top market and consumes two-thirds of the global supply. Chinese total imports last year of 95 million metric tons were 50 % more than the South American giant’s entire exports.“The Chinese can talk all they want about finding other sources of soybeans,” but 80 % come from the United States, Brazil and Argentina, said Michael Cordonnier, president of Soybean & Corn Advisor, Inc., a U.S. research firm.“If you want to import soybeans, it generally must be from one of those three countries,” said Cordonnier in an email.Regulators also cut import duties on automobiles on July 1 but raised them on vehicles from the United States. That helps luxury brands that import from Germany and Japan.Replacing markets for Chinese exporters that support tens of millions of jobs will be harder.The United States bought $430 billion of China’s exports last year, or 20 % of the $2.2 trillion total. The No. 2 market was the 28-nation European Union at $370 billion.“We can’t afford to lose the U.S. market,” said David Hu, general manager of Sinohood Bags Factory Ltd. in the southeastern city of Yiwu.Americans bought 40 % of his canvas tote bags last year, including the most profitable customized versions with Christmas and other designs.“What we export to Europe is lower-end products with lower prices,” said Mr. Hu. “We could explore the Indian, Vietnamese or Philippine markets. But the prices they offer would be too low.”Chinese officials point to potential markets in the “Belt and Road,” a multibillion-dollar initiative led by President Xi Jinping to boost trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to Europe.That has brought a flood of contracts to Chinese state-owned builders but complaints about costs have hurt its appeal. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia announced this month the cancellation of plans for Chinese-built projects including a $20 billion rail line.“There is potential for development in areas such as central Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and South America. But their problems are development imbalance and economic instability,” said Li Yong, a senior fellow at the China Association of International Trade, an industry group.Local officials have met with exporters to exhort them to “diversify markets,” according to the state press.Authorities in the central city of Jingzhou visited exporters to help with customs forms, financing and other details, the website China Industry and Commerce News said.Ren, the surgical glove maker, said his 300-employee company was looking at Europe and developing countries but demand was sluggish.Some companies are confident of keeping their U.S. market share. That reflects the possible success of official efforts to develop higher-tech goods instead of competing on price alone.The general manager of Yihua Electronic Equipment Co. in southern China’s Guangdong said the tariffs should not affect sales of its digital soldering guns, one fifth of which are sold to the United States.“With the 25 percent tariffs, ours still are cheaper than similar German- or Japanese-made products,” said the manager, who would give only his surname, Gou. “We are not producing something like shoes and clothing that could be easily replaced.”Trump’s pressure is likely to backfire by encouraging Beijing to throw even more resources at nurturing its own technology creators.China’s search for non-U.S. suppliers could help companies such as Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc. But redesigning a phone or network gear and then gaining regulatory and customer approval can take a minimum of three to five years.“For now,” said He of Oxford Economics, “China remains technologically dependent on the U.S.”Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:54 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-in-struggle-to-curb-reliance-on-us-market-suppliers/article24789607.ece© The HinduDiplomatic Affairs Editor Suhasini Haidar and Associate Editor Narayan Lakshman discuss the Indian Ocean state and its ties with India in the context of the regime-change there.The media-savvy queen posted from the Science Museum Thursday to help promote the museum’s summer exhibition.Using an iPad, she shared an image on theAlready a user?

2018-08-27,"Mumbai: Cousins Raj and Uddhav Thackeray, known for their political tussles, have found a new bone of contention: control over Mumbai’s cable operators and distributors.With Reliance Jio’s fibre technology finding its way into almost every housing society in the city and posing a tough challenge to the local cable operator, Raj’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and Uddhav’s Shiv Sena have taken to the streets. And going by their posturing in support of cable operators, a majority of whom are Marathi, it seems they have no intention of making it smooth for Reliance’s expansion.‘Fibre will kill us’Tushar Afale, general secretary, Maharashtra Navnirman Cable Sena (MNCS), said, “We aren’t against the company doing business here, but Mumbai’s cable industry was developed and shaped by local operators. A big company like Reliance is now setting up its own fibre network, which will directly kill the local cable operator.”In the past week alone, Raj has met with over 300 cable operators, assuring that the party will stand with them. The issue was first raised by MNCS when its leader in Goregaon, Virendra Jadhav, damaged Reliance’s fibre network in the area. Mr. Afale said his party has only one demand: “They shouldn’t bypass the cable operator while reaching out to the customer. This is beneficial to the end user as well. In case customers want to switch to another service, they can do so easily.”The cable operators’ fear of losing business is based on the existing industry pyramid, with the broadcaster at the top. Then comes multi-system operators, like Hathway and In Cable, and at the base is the cable operator. Over the past few years, distributors, who control several operators, have become an integral part. Mumbai has close to 9,000 cable operators, and the business employs around one lakh people. Industry insiders say despite the easy availability of digital TV, cable operators control close to 85% of the business in the city.Sena joins frayWith MNS taking the lead, the Shiv Sena too has jumped into the fray. In a meeting with cable operators and distributors on Saturday, party chief Uddhav Thackeray said the Sena stands with them, and that their livelihood will not be threatened.Sena MLC Anil Parab, who heads the Cable Operator and Distributor Association, said inroads into the businesss by Reliance Jio would adversely affect the local cable operator. “These are Marathi people. We can do the work needed, and therefore we demand that local operators not be bypassed.”Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:52:55 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mns-sena-back-local-cable-operators-against-reliance/article24787406.ece© The HinduTwo of the three accused in custody are civic body officialsAlready a user?

2018-09-14,"Reliance Infrastructure sold its Mumbai city power distribution business to Adani Transmission Limited (ATL) for ₹18,800 crore, making it the largest deal in the Indian power sector till date. Lalit Jalan, CEO, Reliance Infrastructure, spoke about the company’s growth plans. Edited excerpts:We have received ₹13,800 crore as the first tranche of this transformative deal.We also expect to get ₹5,000 crore in regulatory assets, which will flow to us over the next couple of years. We have an option of discounting those through AA+ non-convertible debentures and getting the cash upfront.We have managed to whittle down our debt by a whopping 65% with the sale of integrated Mumbai power business and the entire proceeds from the transaction - ₹13,800-crore - has been utilised for debt liability payoffs. This, along with the arbitration awards we have already won to tune of ₹6,000 crore, and we’re looking at wiping off the entire debt of the company and becoming cash-surplus in calendar year 2019.Three years ago, we embarked upon a strategy for Reliance Infrastructure to transform itself into an asset-light, high-growth, high-dividend and high-ROE company.Our asset monetisation exercise is now complete. We plan to focus on our fast-growing engineering and construction (E&C) business going forward, where our order book has scaled over nine times in last three years to ₹28,500 crore right now. We aim to grow it to ₹50,000 crore by FY19.Reliance Infrastructure’s profitability will not be affected on the whole. Reliance Energy had an EBITDA of around ₹1,500 crore, which would reflect in lower EBITDA for Reliance Infrastructure after this deal.However, since our interest cost will also come down from about ₹2,600 crore to less than ₹800 crore per annum, our profitability will not be impacted.The turnover could come down a bit in the first year. But next year onwards, with our E&C order book translating into turnover, we will see RInfra’s turnover crossing the current levels.Reliance Infrastructure now has the strongest balance sheet in infrastructure — power sector. Our debt-to-equity ratio is barely 0.33 : 1 whereas the median ratio for the sector is 4:1, often as high as 6 or 8: 1. The company is all set for double-digit growth. We are looking at being cash-surplus in calendar year 2019.We’re a company with ₹22,000 crore-plus net worth. Delhi Power Distribution Business, which is two and a half times the size of the Mumbai Business across a range of parameters, is the lynchpin of the company going forward with its annual turnover of ₹16,000 crore and cash EBITDA of ₹4,000 crore. Our Delhi DISCOMs distribute power to 42 lakh customers or 70% of Delhi, and serve a peak demand of 5,000 MW as against 1,800 MW for Mumbai. There’s still a good 15 years to go for license in Delhi, while the business is organically witnessing impressive growth.Our fast-growing engineering and construction business will be the flagship of the company going forward. We have scaled our order book by a factor of over 9 in the last three years to ₹28,500 crore right now. Reliance Infrastructure is pursuing project opportunities worth around ₹2 lakh crore to increase its EPC order book to ₹50,000 crore by FY19. We are well-positioned to garner sizeable market share in transport sector.We were looking at the option of monetising our roads assets.However, further monetisation of the company’s assets is not on the table right now.Reliance Mumbai Metro is a marque project. It has an EBITDA of ₹150 crore and, as our chairman Anil D. Ambani has pointed out, given the long concession period, it will be profitable especially as the footfalls are growing exponentially.We have presented our Resolution Plan to the bankers. It is for the Committee of Creditors to consider that.We will look at stressed assets on a case to case basisOnce completed, Versova-Bandra Sea Link (VBSL) project will transform the way people live and travel in Mumbai. It will slash commute time from Worli to Versova from almost two hours to a mere 15 minutes. At 17-odd km, VBSL is three times the size of the existing sea link, with 34 km of up and down connectivity. The existing sea link carries 10 lakh vehicles per annum. Once completed, VBSL is estimated to serve nearly ten times that number, or one crore vehicles, annually. The project would allow Mumbaikars to have hassle-free connectivity from Worli to Versova with just one toll stoppage.Though the project duration is five years, we effectively have only three and a half years to complete it as work would be stalled for three months every year during monsoon. The existing sea link took almost 10 years to complete, despite being only one third in span compared to VBSL. However, Reliance Infrastructure is confident that with our partners, we shall be able to complete the project ahead of time. We plan to start work on the project in October this year.How much cash will the company get on a net basis from the sale of Mumbai power distribution business?When can we expect Reliance Infrastructure to become a zero debt company?What’s the rationale behind selling the Mumbai power business given that it was generating healthy cash flows?Minus Mumbai power business, what would be the profile of the company in terms of topline, bottomline and operations?What would be the debt:equity of Reliance Infrastructure after the deal?What’s profile of Delhi distribution business?What is the company’s order book pipeline as of now?The company was planning to sell its portfolio of road assets...The auditor has raised questions about the viability of the Mumbai metro operations as a going concern...Reliance Infra subsidiary Reliance Naval has been referred to the NCLT for resolution as the bankers have failed to approve your resolution plan within the prescribed deadline of RBI.

2018-09-21,"Former French President Francois Hollande has claimed that the Indian government suggested industrialist Anil Ambani’s company as the offset partner for the €7.87 billion deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighter jets. Mr. Hollande was the French President at the time the deal was agreed to in 2015.He told a French news outlet, Mediapart.fr, on Friday that his government didn’t have “a choice” in the selection of Reliance Defence, the company owned by Mr. Ambani.“It is the Indian government which has proposed this service group and it is Dassault that has negotiated with Ambani. We didn’t have a choice, we took the interlocutor that was given to us,” he was quoted as saying.His comments fly in the face of repeated assertions made at the highest level of the Indian government that it was Dassault Aviation (DA) that selected Reliance Defence as its offset partner. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said “no offset contract has been signed so far” and an agreement between two companies did not require the permission of the government. “As per the applicable guidelines, DA is free to select the Indian offset Partners and provide their details at the time of seeking offset credits, or one-year prior to the discharge of offset obligation,” the government had stated.Responding to Mr. Hollande’s comments, the Defence Ministry tweeted that the statement was being “verified.” “It is reiterated that neither [the] Government of India nor [the] French Government had any say in the commercial decision,” the Ministry said in a tweet.Reacting to the revelations, Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “The PM personally negotiated & changed the #Rafale deal behind closed doors. Thanks to François Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to a bankrupt Anil Ambani. The PM has betrayed India. He has dishonoured the blood of our soldiers.”Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram pulled up the government over the revelations. “In the NDA-negotiated Rafale aircraft deal, we have got no aircraft, we have got only lies. What is the new lie that the government will put out in response to Mr. Hollande? Defence Minister has been called out again! This time by then President of France, Mr. Hollande,” he tweeted.In September 2016, India and France signed a €7.87 bn agreement for 36 Rafale jets in fly-away condition. The deal includes aircraft, spares, weapons, maintenance and performance guarantee for five years. The deal has a 50% offset clause to be executed by DA and its partners. Under this, DA and Reliance Defence have set up a joint venture to manufacture aerospace components.In a recent interview Ms. Sitharaman denied any government role in the choice of offset partner in the Rafale deal.She had said, “Isn’t that a decision of a commercial enterprise to take on its own? I have nothing to do with it. I have not prompted them, not led them, not told them, not instructed them. I have not done any match-making whatsoever.”The Reliance Group had stated that it got the offset contract from DA and did not receive any contract from the Defence Ministry till date.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:33:05 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-govt-proposed-reliance-defence-as-partner-in-rafale-french-media-quoting-hollande/article25009084.ece© The HinduIn this new podcast series tracking major campaign speeches across the country, Varghese K George is in conversation with Jayant Sriram toAlready a user?

2018-09-22,"After explosive revelations by former French President Francois Hollande on the Rafale deal, Defence Ministry said on Saturday that “unnecessary controversies” are being sought to be created on the purported statement and reiterated that the Government had “no role in the selection of Reliance Defence as the offset partner.”The French government as well as Dassault Aviation (DA) the manufacturer of Rafale jets too issued statements reiterating the procurement procedure while neither directly denied the main point raised by Mr. Hollande.“As per the guidelines, the vendor is to provide the details of the offset partners either at the time of seeking offset credit or one year prior to discharge of offset obligation, which in this case will be due from 2020,” the Ministry said. It said Mr. Hollande’s statement needs to be seen in “its full context where the French media has raised issues of conflict of interest involving persons close to the former President.”Also ReadRafale deal: Had no role in choice of Indian partner, says French governmentThe Ministry was responding to comments made by former French President Francois Hollande that Dassault Aviation (manufacturers of Rafale fighter aircraft) was given no choice but to partner with the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence for the offset clause in the fighter jet deal.The Ministry also referred to media reports of February, 2012, which suggest that DA, within two weeks of being declared the lowest bidder for procurement of 126 aircraft by the UPA Government, had entered into a pact for partnership with Reliance Industries in the defence sector.However, it must be noted that the 2012 pact was with Reliance Industries of Mukesh Ambani which had later exited the defence business.French Government said in a statement that they had no role in “the choice of Indian industrial partners” while DA said it was their choice of selecting Reliance Defence as the local offset partner. However, the two statement did not directly deny the claim by Mr.  Hollande that it was the Indian Government which proposed the name of Reliance Defence.Also ReadRafale deal: BJP slams Rahul for attack on PM“The French government is in no manner involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners who have been, are being, or will be selected by French companies. In accordance with India’s acquisition procedure, French companies have the full freedom to choose the Indian partner companies…,” Spokesperson of the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs said in a statement late on Friday.The statement added that the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) signed on September 23, 2016 between the French and Indian governments for 36 Rafale aircraft concerns the obligations of the French government “solely with regard to ensuring the delivery and quality of this equipment.”Mr. Hollande told a French news outlet on Friday that his government didn’t have “a choice” in the selection of Reliance Defence. “It is the Indian government who has proposed this service group and it is Dassault that has negotiated with Ambani. We didn’t have a choice, we took the interlocutor that was given to us,” he was quoted as saying.Also ReadClear-cut corruption in Rafale deal, PM must clarify stance, says Rahul GandhiDA said that in addition to the IGA, there is a separate contract which commits them to “make compensation investments (offsets) in India” worth 50 per cent of the value of the purchase.“In this framework, and in accordance with the policy of Make in India, DA has decided to make a partnership with India’s Reliance Group. This is DA’s choice, as CEO Eric Trappier had explained in an interview...,” the company said in a statement.Under this, DA and Reliance group have set up a Joint Venture Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd in Nagpur Nagpur for “manufacturing parts for Falcon and Rafale aircraft.”Both the statements pointed that several other such agreements were signed by other French companies with both public and private firms in India. “Other negotiations are ongoing with a hundred-odd other potential partners,” DA added.Rafale deal: Had no role in choice of Indian partner, says French governmentRafale deal: BJP slams Rahul for attack on PMClear-cut corruption in Rafale deal, PM must clarify stance, says Rahul GandhiPlease enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:01 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rafale-deal-centre-maintains-it-had-no-role-in-selection-of-reliance-defence/article25015770.ece© The HinduIn this new podcast series tracking major campaign speeches across the country, Varghese K George is in conversation with Jayant Sriram toAlready a user?

2018-09-23,"Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said former French President Francois Hollande had made contradictory statements on the Rafale deal and asserted that “truth cannot have two versions.”In a Facebook post titled, ‘A Questionable Statement Which Circumstances And Facts Demolish,’ Mr. Jaitley said the former French President’s statement that the Government of India pushed for the Anil Ambani group “rhymed” with Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s “prediction.”Mr. Hollande’s statement has triggered a political storm in India with Mr. Gandhi charging Prime Minister Narendra Modi with personally changing the deal to suit the Anil Ambani-led Reliance group.“He [Mr. Hollande] has, in a subsequent statement, said he is ‘not aware’ if the government ever lobbied for Reliance Defence and that ‘the partners chose themselves.’ Truth cannot have two versions,” he said in his blog.In a subsequent TV interview to new agency ANI, the Finance Minister said there appears to be some jugalbandi (connection) between the statements of Mr. Hollande and Mr. Gandhi’s August 30 tweet that the Rafale would “drop a few bunker buster bombs in the next couple of weeks.”Also ReadThe plane truth“I am surprised. On August 30, he [Mr. Gandhi] tweeted that bombs are going to explode in France [over the Rafale deal]. How he came to know about that,” Mr. Jaitley asked.“Though I do not have any proof of this jugalbandi, this creates suspicion in mind...There is definitely something ... a statement comes (from Hollande), then it is contradicted. But he (Mr. Gandhi) predicted this to happen 20 days in advance,” Mr. Jaitley said even as he ruled out scrapping the deal in the wake of the Opposition’s campaign.He also pointed out how the Congress is now relying on Mr. Hollande's statement while the party’s official Twitter handle had accused him [Mr. Hollande] of receiving bribes from the Anil Ambani group.In his detailed blog, Mr. Jaitley had asserted that both the French government and Dassault Aviation had “denied the correctness of the former French President’s first statement.”“There is no ‘partnership’, as suggested by the former President, with regard to the 36 Rafale aircraft to be supplied by Dassault Aviation to the Government of India,” Mr Jaitley posted.“It was a Government-to-Government agreement under which the complete weaponised aircraft are to come to the Indian Air Force. No manufacturing is to be done in India. It is, therefore, erroneous for anybody to suggest that there is a ‘partnership’ in the supply of the 36 Rafale aircraft,” he said in his blog.Meanwhile, the French government said on Sunday it feared damage to its relations with India after Mr. Hollande’s remarks.“I find these remarks made overseas, which concern important international relations between France and India, do not help anyone and above all do not help France,” junior Foreign Minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said on Sunday about Mr. Hollande.“Because one is no longer in office, causing damage to a strategic partnership between India and France by making remarks that clearly cause controversy in India is really not appropriate,” he said in an interview on Radio J.(With AFP inputs)A controversy is sought to be created on the basis of a statement made by the former French President Hollande, that the Reliance Defence ‘partnership’ with Dassault Aviation was entered at the suggestion of the Indian Government. In a subsequent statement the former President has sought to suggest that Reliance Defence emerged on the scene after the agreement with the Indian Government was entered into. He has, in a subsequent statement, said that he is ‘not aware’ if Government ever lobbied for Reliance Defence and that ‘the partners chose themselves’. Truth cannot have two versions.The French Government and M/s Dassault Aviation have categorically denied the correctness of the former President’s first statement. The French Government has stated that the decision with regard to the offset contracts of Dassault Aviation are taken by the company and not the Government. Dassault Aviation itself has suggested that they have entered into multiple contracts with several public sector and private sector companies with regard to the offset contracts and the decision is entirely theirs.Without commenting on the correctness or otherwise of a controversy in the French media, it may be mentioned that the former French President, Hollande, is countering statement made against him with regard to a conflict of interest in his dealing with the Reliance Defence.The accuracy of the statements made by the individuals may be questioned but circumstances never lie. This is evident from the following facts:The former French President’s first statement rhymes with Rahul Gandhi’s prediction.The conclusionOne Reliance Group was a part of this deal since 2012. It dropped out of defence production. The other Reliance Group was already in defence. They are not partners in the Rafale deal. They have no contract with either Government of India or Government of France. They were not selected as one of the many offset partners by any Government. ‘The partners (Dassault and Reliance) selected themselves’ as former President Hollande now says. This contradicts his first questionable statement which the French Government and Dassault have denied. The facts contradict the same. His second statement in Montreal, Canada to AFP makes the veracity of his first statement even more questionable.The plane truthPlease enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:02 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hollande-contradicted-himself-dassault-chose-reliance-on-its-own-says-jaitley/article25019787.ece© The HinduIn this new podcast series tracking major campaign speeches across the country, Varghese K George is in conversation with Jayant Sriram toAlready a user?

2018-09-26,"Facebook's WhatsApp is working closely with Reliance Jio to spread awareness of false messages, weeks after the telecom operator opened up the messaging service to millions of customers using its cheap internet-enabled phone.Jio this month gave its more than 25 million JioPhone customers, many of them first-time internet users, access to WhatsApp at a time when the messaging service is battling false and incendiary texts and videos circulating on its platform.Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani launched the JioPhone last year at a refundable deposit of ₹1,500. The device is internet enabled but didn't initially allow the use of WhatsApp or have several popular smartphone features.All new users of the JioPhone get educational material that tells them about spotting a forwarded WhatsApp message and encourages them to share messages thoughtfully, WhatsApp spokesman Carl Woog told Reuters.“We are working closely with Jio to continue our education campaign for WhatsApp users,” Mr. Woog said.More than 30 people have died this year in mob violence triggered by vitriolic messages on social media and WhatsApp, according to unofficial estimates, and police have previously told Reuters that minorities have been targeted in some remote and rural regions.That has prompted Union government to call on WhatsApp to take immediate action to “end this menace”.WhatsApp has already taken some steps to quell the rise of fake news.

Chandrababu Naidu in the presence of Union Ministers Arun Jaitley and Nirmala Sitharaman at the CII Partnership Summit here on January 11, 2016.While the government has informed the project proponent, Reliance Naval Engineering (erstwhile Reliance Defence), that it is ready to transfer the land ownership on payment of ₹17.5 lakh per acre, there has been no response to the offer.Highly reliable sources told The Hindu that the project proponent was insisting on allotment of land on the lines of the 1,000 acres given to the Lankan apparel major, Brandix, which had set up an apparel park at Atchutapuram near here. Brandix had been allotted land on lease for at the rate of ₹1 per acre per annum.A senior official said the authorities were considering various options.Of the 3,000 acres sought for the defence shipbuilding facility, the A.P. Industrial Infrastructure Corporation has already earmarked 1,000 acres.At the time of signing the MoU, Mr. Ambani had announced an investment of ₹5,000 crore.This would go up further in the next phases due to projected investment by the Navy worth ₹3 lakh crore under the ‘Make in India’ initiative on acquisitions and fleet modernisation.Rambilli is home to the Naval Alternative Operational Base (NAOB), where nuclear-powered Arihant Class submarines, which are under construction at the Ship Building Centre in the city, will be docked.In close vicinity, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is also setting up a huge facility.Visakhapatnam is also the headquarters for the submarine arm of the Eastern Naval Command.Besides Reliance ADA Group, Garden Reach Shipbuilding and Engineers, one of the premier public sector shipyards in the country, had also made a proposal for allotment of site to establish a greenfield shipbuilding facility.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:06 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/impasse-over-proposed-reliance-naval-project/article25106241.ece© The HinduTDP banks on welfare schemes; YSRC on goodwill for Jagan and Jana Sena on youthInfluenced by meet on biodiversity, Sudhakar of Chittoor turns a crusaderAlready a user?

2018-10-11,"Dassault Aviation, the French maker of the Rafale jets, viewed the choice of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence as an offset partner, as imperative and mandatory, according to the French independent investigative journal Mediapart.In a piece published on October 10, it cited an internal Dassault Aviation document to conclude that the French company viewed the Ambani alliance as essential to striking the deal.Also ReadIf the Opposition wants to go on a wild goose chase, so be it: Nirmala SitharamanThe publication obtained a copy of a compte-rendu – or report – based on a meeting on 11 May 2017, at which Chief Operating Officer Loik Segalen “effectively represented” Reliance Defence as the counterparty to the sales contract.He told staff representatives that it was “imperative and mandatory” for Dassault Aviation to accept this counterparty “to obtain the export contract for Rafale India,” he said, according to the document.Dassault Aviation did not respond to a request for comment by the publication.The latest revelations follow Mediapart’s explosive conversation with former French President Francoise Hollande in September when he suggested that it was the Indian government that had proposed Anil Ambani’s company as the offset partner for the 7.87 billion euro deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighter jets.He told the journal that his government hadn’t had “a choice” in the selection of Reliance Defence, owned by Mr. Ambani, and that they had taken the “interlocutor that was given to us.”Both the latest revelations and Mr. Hollande’s comments run contrary to the narrative presented by the Indian government that it was Dassault Aviation that had chosen Reliance Defence as its offset partner. Following Mr. Hollande’s comments the Defence Ministry insisted that neither government “had any say in the commercial decision.”Earlier this month Arun Shourie, former Union Minister, and lawyer Prashant Bhushan submitted a 32-page complaint under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and further documents, and urged the Central Bureau of Investigation to open a probe.The complaint alleges that days before the new deal was signed Dassault had been in the final stages of negotiation for 126 aircraft, and that a proposal for HAL to be Dassault’s partner in India for manufacturing through the transfer of technology was on the table.If the Opposition wants to go on a wild goose chase, so be it: Nirmala SitharamanPlease enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:12 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/reliance-choice-was-must-dassault-official/article25185148.ece© The HinduIn this new podcast series tracking major campaign speeches across the country, Varghese K George is in conversation with Jayant Sriram toAlready a user?

2018-11-04,"HSBC India and ING Bank Brussels have successfully executed a blockchain- enabled Letter of Credit (LC) transaction between Reliance Industries (RIL) and Tricon Energy. This is an industry-first, as the blockchain platform integrates with Bolero’s electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) platform to issue and manage an eBL. This allowed a digital transfer of the title of goods from the seller to the buyer in the underlying trade and enabled the underlying trade to be fully digitised.The Letter of Credit (LC) was issued by ING Bank for Tricon Energy USA (importer) with HSBC India as the advising and negotiating bank for RIL, India (exporter).The end-to-end transaction was executed on R3’s Corda blockchain platform which is a single shared application, rather than requiring multiple isolated digital systems across various counterparties, located around the globe, said a statement.Commenting on the transaction, Hitendra Dave, head-global banking and markets, HSBC India said, “The use of blockchain is a significant step towards digitising trade. It has a transformative impact on trade finance transactions and enables greater transparency and enhanced security in addition to making it simpler and faster. The overall efficiency it brings to trade finance ensures cost effectiveness, quicker turnaround and potentially unlocks liquidity for businesses. We’re delighted to partner with RIL and support enhanced digitisation in trade finance. We believe that the collaborative approach adopted to develop this technology has the potential to transform conventional trade finance.”This solution is a significant improvement for any organisation involved in buying and selling goods internationally, as it truly brings together all parties onto one platform, said the statement.Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer, RIL, said, “We are excited to partner with HSBC on digitalisation of trade finance. This reflects our continued commitment to embrace emerging technologies and industry first initiatives. The use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the timelines involved in exchange of export documentation from the extant 7 to 10 days to less than a day. When adopted at scale, it helps in significant optimisation of working capital. Further, use of blockchain in trade finance enhances transparency, security and synergy across all the parties and stakeholders involved.”This transaction validates the commercial and operational viability of blockchain as an alternative to conventional exchanges for paper-based documentation, the statement added.HSBC, ING execute RIL blockchain transactionPlease enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:26 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/ril-hsbc-executes-first-of-its-kind-blockchain-trade-finance-transaction/article25420079.ece© The HinduCurtailed operation cannot support overheadsAlready a user?

2018-11-29,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has upheld the order issued by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directing the resolution professional to reconsider the bid submitted by Reliance Industries Ltd. and JM Financial ARC for Alok Industries.Last year, the Ahmedabad Bench of the NCLT had admitted insolvency proceedings against Alok Industries, an integrated textile manufacturing company operating mainly in the cotton and polyester segments. RIL-JM Financial ARC was the sole bidder in the process. However, the plan did not get through as only 70.28% of the committee of lenders had approved the plan, against the requirement of 75%. However, an amendment made to the IBC had brought the voting threshold to 66%.In June, the resolution professional sought for liquidation of the company. Alok Employees Benefit and Welfare Trust (AEBWT), however, had moved an interlocutory application seeking reconsideration of the bid.NCLT had allowed AEBWT’s application with a direction to the resolution professional to present the resolution plan of the sole bid for a re-look and proper consideration in view of the amendments and without involving any new issues not taken into account earlier.Sicom Ltd., one of the financial creditors of Alok, moved NCLAT against the NCLT order.NCLAT rejected the appeal and noted that the amendments came into force from June 6, 2018, and was applicable to all resolution plans which were not approved by the committee of creditors or by the adjudicating authority. The resolution plan in this instance had not been approved by the adjudicating authority and in the absence of any ineligibility of the bidder under IBC, the NCLT was right in its ruling, NCLAT said.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:33 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nclat-upholds-verdict-to-review-ril-jm-bid-for-alok/article25626169.ece© The HinduBetter awareness about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demandNet worth estimated at $54 billion; Amazon’s Jeff Bezos retains top slot with $ 147 billionAlready a user?

2018-12-06,"A negative trend in the global markets, along with a weakening rupee, affected investor sentiment in equity markets, with the benchmark indices falling for the third straight session on Thursday. Continued selling by foreign investors also acted as a catalyst.The 30-share Sensex lost 572.28 points, or 1.59%, to close at 35,312.13 with all but one constituent ending the day in the red. Maruti Suzuki India, Tata Motors, Yes Bank, Adani Ports, Reliance Industries and ONGC were among the top losers on Thursday.Oil stock witnessed selling pressure ahead of the OPEC meeting that could result in a possible supply cut. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped 2.76% to trade at $59.86 per barrel.The overall market breadth was also very weak, with more than 1,800 stocks in the red as against 707 gainers on BSE. Further, all the sectoral indices too ended in negative territory.The broader Nifty closed at 10,601.15, down 181.75 points, or 1.69%.Kamlesh Rao, managing director and chief executive officer, Kotak Securities, believes that factors like global trade war, Fed rates and Brexit outcomes would set the sentiment of the global economy in 2019.According to Mr. Rao, Nifty’s correction in terms of valuation is nearly over and the index could see a potential upside of 16-20% by December 2019 if the election outcome is positive in the form of a single party winning the majority.In the event of a fragmented mandate or coalition, the Nifty may fall, but still be range-bound between 10,000 and 10,500 points by December 2019, he added.Elsewhere in Asia, Hang Seng lost more than 660 points, while Nikkei was also down over 400 points. The Dow Jones lost nearly 800 points overnight over concerns of fresh tensions between the U.S. and China after Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada and the U.S. sought her extradition.Back in India, the recent weakness has also been on account of the selling activity of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). In the current month, overseas investors have been net sellers at ₹330 crore after having invested ₹5,981 crore in November.The sentiment in the equity markets spilled over to the currency market, with the rupee plunging 0.62% or 44 paise against the dollar. After opening lower at 70.82, the rupee breached the 71/$ mark to touch 71.14 before closing the day at 70.90.Incidentally, dollar strengthened against all major currencies after the arrest of Ms. Wanzhou. The strengthening of the dollar also added to the woes of the rupee.Reuters adds...The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 708.51 points, or 2.83% at 9.45 p.m. IST slipping back into losses for the year. The S&P 500 was down 69.48 points, or 2.57% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 147.18 points, or 2.06%.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:35 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/markets-rupee-end-in-red-maruti-ril-among-top-losers/article25682686.ece© The HinduAlready a user?

2018-12-15,"Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) is planning to increase its refinery capacity by 50% to over 100 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), to meet the increasing demand of refined products in India.The proposed expansion involves a brownfield project for two of its existing refineries in Jamnagar, and a new greenfield project at a cost of $10 billion or over ₹70,000 crore, said a source in the know of the development.Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 6,60,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 33 mtpa, in 1999.In 2008, RIL commissioned an export-oriented unit (EOU) with capacity to process 540,000 barrels per day (bpd) or 27 mtpa, adjacent to its existing refinery, making it the world’s largest refinery complex in a single location.The company had already expanded its refinery capacity in Jamnagar to 70 mtpa last year, and sought government approval for environmental clearance for further expansion.Expansion of production capacity of Reliance export-oriented refinery is listed in the agenda for the Expert Appraisal Committee of the environment ministry’s meeting to be held on Wednesday“Expansion of production capacity of SEZ refinery from 35.2 mmtpa to 41 mmtpa at Reliance Industries Jamnagar by M/s Reliance Industries Limited - For Environmental Clearance,” reads an agenda on the PRIVESH (Pro Active and Responsive facilitation by Interactive and Virtuous Environment and Single Window Hub) website of the ministry.India’s refining capacity is projected to grow to 439 MTPA from 245 MTPA currently.The company has already started discussions with global refinery process licencers and equipment vendors for a new refining train at the Jamnagar complex, the source said.An e-mail sent to Reliance seeking response remained unanswered till the time of going to press.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:36 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/ril-to-expand-its-refining-capacity-to-over-100-mtpa/article25753134.ece© The HinduCurtailed operation cannot support overheadsAlready a user?

2018-12-18,"Joint Collector P. Yadi Reddy said the government has accorded priority to rural artisans to promote self-employment and thereby, strengthen the rural economy.As part of the programme, five persons of the Salivahana (potter) community from the district were sent to Sri Ramanananda Theertha Rural University for training in pot making on August 25. In continuation of that, a three-day training programme in clay water bottle making was launched here on Monday, he said, adding that as many as 30 persons were selected to undergo the training.Due to the widespread use of plastic water bottles, the environment is getting degraded and with the replacement of plastic bottles with clay bottles, the degradation can be prevented to an extent, he said. He promised that the district administration would ensure marketing facility for pottery items and added that those undergoing training must, in turn, train their community members to manufacture clay items.BC Welfare Officer Jhansi Rani appealed to rural artisans to avail themselves of the training programme, which could prove handy for potters to gain financial strength.Salivahanas’ district president Ramesh, vice-president Vithal and secretary Madhu also participated.Please enter a valid email address.Printable version | Apr 5, 2019 9:53:38 AM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/empowering-rural-artisans-for-greater-self-reliance/article25766776.ece© The HinduEvery year, more than 20,000 cases go undiagnosed in TelanganaAlready a user?
