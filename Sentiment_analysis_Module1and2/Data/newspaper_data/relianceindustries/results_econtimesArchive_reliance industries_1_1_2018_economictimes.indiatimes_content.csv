2018-01-02,"MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) has commissioned a giant cracker project, completing its massive petchem capex programme, which Mukesh Ambani said marks a paradigm shift in the profitability of the petrochemicals business.With the commissioning of the refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) unit, the company completed its largest ever capex of around $15 billion on petrochemicals business, which could potentially double the revenue of the business.“The world’s first ROGC and downstream plants marks a paradigm shift in the profitability and sustainability of RIL’s petrochemicals business,” Chairman Ambani said in a statement.The ROGC complex uses off-gases from RIL’s two refineries at Jamnagar as input, making the raw material cost for the unit almost nominal. This will boost the profit margin and help the company compete with low-cost producers from the Middle East and North America.Analysts have pegged the commission of this unit as value accretive, with the full impact of it kicking in the next few quarters.The ROGC plant will act as a link between the refinery and petrochemical units run by the company. It will turn the off-gas from the refinery to ethylene and propylene, which will go through further value addition at the perches units to deliver high-value polymer.RIL said there are 270 ethylene plants globally with a combined capacity of over 170 million tonne per annum (mtpa). With the commissioning of this unit, RIL has a total ethylene capacity of 4 mtpa across five sites.“RIL joins the distinguished league of top petrochemical producers globally by doubling its ethylene capacity...With ROGC and imported ethane, RIL has one of the most competitive and flexible cracker portfolio,"" the company said.In the year ended 2016-17, RIL’s petchem division clocked revenue of Rs 92,472 crore with operating profit of Rs 12,990 crore. Industry watchers believe the newly commissioned petchem units could drive the revenue and profits to surpass that of its core refinery business.The company said the ROGC complex was built in record time with approximately 40% lower capital cost compared to the similar projects globally.RIL has capability to produce entire range of PE grades covering all end-uses in the Indian market.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-industries-completes-16-billion-expansiondoubles-ethylene-capacity-to-4-million-metric-tonne/articleshow/62339484.cms

2018-01-03,"MUMBAI: GIC Re has provided reinsurance support to Reliance Industries’ refinery and petrochemical plants at Jamnagar and Hazira in Gujarat. The mega risk policy of Rs 2 lakh crore is shared with 10 insurance companies, said two people familiar with the matter. Reliance Industries has paid a premium of Rs 625 crore for the cover. New India Assurance is in the lead, with the support of nine other insurance companies in the mega risk policy.The refinery has the highest asset value at a single location in the world, and is also one of the largest refining complexes, with an aggregate capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day. The policy has come into force from December 31, 2017, and about half the risk is placed in the international reinsurance market.“Such risks cannot be absorbed by any single insurance company or even a single reinsurance company and that is where such risks are shared among a number of reinsurers globally,” said a source aware of the development. GIC Re executives declined to comment.Usually, one reinsurer, known as the leader, decides the terms of such covers. Other reinsurers then adopt the terms decided by the leader and write the risk. GIC Re is also providing significant support to other large players in the oil and petroleum sector, such as ONGC, Bharat Petroleum, Mangalore Refinery, Indian Oil and Cairn Energy. This practice also applies to infrastructure, airlines, oil and energy risk, exposures and agriculture insurance, or any exposure that goes beyond the balance sheet strength of an insurer.Insurers mostly find themselves short of required financial strength to write such risks on their own.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gic-re-backs-rs-2l-crore-cover-to-reliance-industries-units/articleshow/62347445.cms

2018-01-03,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries is likely to see a big cash-flow boost as projects of over USD 40 billion start to deliver in full swing this fiscal while capex falls, international brokerage house CLSA said today.In a report, CLSA said stabilisation of just-commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) and petcoke gasification projects would boost EBITDA.The downstream expansions called J3 are likely to fully stabilise in early 2018 and should allow almost a full year of benefit to flow in FY2019.RIL, which completed its capital expenditure cycle, yesterday announced commissioning of the world's largest refinery off-gas cracker complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. ROGC will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals.It is in advanced stage of commissioning petcoke gasification plant, which will convert coal and coke, the lowest-cost fossil fuels, into gas.CLSA said monetisation of the two plants will boost the operating income of the company but full benefits will come only in the next financial year.""Although it has indicated potential annual benefit of USD 2-2.5 billion, we model a smaller amount of USD 1.8 billion from these two projects.

2018-01-04,"Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani spoke to Devina Sengupta & Romit Guha in his first interview in 10 years. Edited excerpts:What’s your view on the 2G court ruling?Truth prevails. No individual or corporation should undergo this humiliation, slander, damage to individual and corporate reputation. Reputation that you have built over years and years can be broken in an instant.The legacy of the one-time charge came from the 2G spectrum. The Tatas thought 850 MHz was junk, so they went and surrendered their spectrum because of the one-time charge. The legacy of the one-time charge came from the 2G spectrum case. Similarly, the case filed by the COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India) against us and the Tatas on dual technology was again based on the 2G case.Will you be looking at filing for damages against the government or individuals?It is premature to talk of any action. Various people will look at their options. Telcos will look at damages caused by cancellation, which are corporate actions. Individuals will start thinking of their own. Still too many moving parts to pick any direction.So, you do not rule it out?You cannot rule out anything. What will you do, when will you, how can you do? There are so many constituents in the 2G constituency. Somebody does something, there is a collateral damage from the other side. It is complex, not simple as yes or no, it is not black and white.Did you pay the price of being rich and famous?I am neither rich, nor famous. I am just a common man.When did Reliance Communications (RCom) see the writing on the wall?In 2015-16, the telecom market was under consolidation. Competition was waning a little, the strong were becoming stronger and the weak were becoming weaker. At that time for Reliance Communications, we had that choice that shall I be consolidated or shall I be a consolidator.We had discussions with Bharti. We also had a discussion with Vodafone — those were the two big boys. We also had a discussion with the Tatas. On the ‘consolidator’ part, we had discussions with SSTL, Telenor and Aircel, whom we could effectively acquire.Why didn’t deals with Bharti Airtel or Vodafone go through? And did you talk to Jio as well?Clearly, when we looked at Bharti and Vodafone, (we) faced the challenge of the 2G controversy, which was still unresolved in the courts. Vodafone also had its arbitration issues, Tatas were going through a transition in their group leadership. So we looked at Aircel, SSTL and Telenor. Our first choice was SSTL. That deal just got consummated, so that speaks volumes about the difficulties of completing M&A transactions in India. The processes are so slow, the permissions so many, the delays are so many and the legal systems are so vast and so complex. No one can put a timeline to any deal getting done.Then came in Jio, and we did our spectrum sharing and trading deals in the 850 MHz band with them.Why did the Aircel and Brookfield deals fail?(On Aircel) clearly, there were legal challenges—there was a matter of Maxis in the 2G case in the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) court, but it had nothing to do with our deal. There was also a PIL (public interest litigation) in the Supreme Court, which gave an order that no sharing or trading deals could be done by Aircel as Mr Ananda Krishnan (the Aircel promoter) was not appearing before the court.Also, our discussions with lenders and the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) made it absolutely clear that unless the SC (Supreme Court) matter is resolved, the DoT will not give its final approval to the merger with Aircel. We tried for six months, but after that, what doesn’t work doesn’t work.Was Jio the single most important factor in forcing you to close down wireless?In the run-up to the proposed merger with Aircel was the launch of Jio. So, for 10 years, 40 quarters, RCom showed EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth, revenue growth, declared dividend, and then landscape changed in Indian telecom sector. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India), in April, also cautioned banks, disallowed new funding and brought in higher provisioning. Those were cascading effects. As I mentioned at my AGM (annual general meeting) in September, I called it creative destruction.We looked at opportunity in adversity. This was a learning from my father. November 1, we put the entire monetisation programme to work.We basically decided to exit mobility, because that was the cash burn. Other businesses were doing well, with 50-60% EBIDTA, an annuity nature and long-term contracts. With marquee companies like Facebook, Yahoo!, Amazon and Alibaba coming to India and buying space in data centres, there’s a huge growth opportunity and this trend is to continue.Please share some specifics of your recent asset sale deal with Reliance Jio? What does CDB (China Development Bank, a lender) get?As you are aware, the evaluation of all the bids, as part of RCom’s asset monetisation plan, was carried out by the oversight committee put in place for this exercise. Jio emerged as the highest bidder after a competitive and transparent bidding process, for assets such as spectrum, towers, optic fiber and related infrastructure. All proceeds from this sale will be solely used for pre-payment and repayment of debt.""You had initially planned to sell your enterprise business, but that’s now not part of the assets that have been sold. Why? Did the bids come in lower than your expectations?The new RCom is a strong company focussed on global and enterprise business. We will have a strong strategic partner coming in in the next few months.You faced headwinds in the process of tying up the asset sale deal. Why did CDB move the insolvency court against you?It is a humongous task to work with 38 banks, rating agencies. We were engaged with Chinese lenders — by far the largest lender to the group. Their exposure is multifold compared to that of SBI (State Bank of India). So, they (CDB) made a request to pay them around Rs 200 crore of interest as part of resolution so that their provisioning is taken care of. We went to the banks and asked them to give us an NoC (no-objection certificate) to pay <Rupee>200 crore, which we would arrange ourselves. Indian lenders strongly opposed… They are an invitee to the JLF (joint lenders’ forum), as being a foreign bank, they cannot be members. So CDB went to NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) to protect their interests. As a secured creditor, it is a matter of one or two hearings and it is bound to get admitted.Why did the JLF accept the latest proposal and not the first two?We had CDB in NCLT and Indian banks and lenders simply said no on all issues. We told the banks—you have a choice of CDB taking you to bankruptcy, you have a choice of Indian banks supporting CDB and the company goes into bankruptcy. And the choice that the company files for bankruptcy on its own, as it has a full plan for resolution. (We) told the Chinese that the solution is there and let us go to court and ask for adjournment. If you see on January 5 that there is progress, you take a few weeks more of adjournment.I said at the end of the meeting: “When you have money, more money comes. When you have no money, no money comes.”What is your takeaway?I am guided by moral financing. I morally owe you money—this is not a grant, this is not a gift, this is not charity… The Dhirubhai Ambani legacy is protected—we have kept our word and our moral commitment, which is most important.Was 2017 the toughest year for Reliance Group?It has been a remarkable learning—year 2017. Getting rid of the clouds and of 2G, where I had to personally go to the CBI, face interrogation, go to the trial court as a witness for the prosecution, had to drag my wife Tina to the court. Never ever again do I want to experience such issues.In 2017, we were strangulated from all sides, and with the banking system saying do not expect any resolutions or approvals (for other group companies) till the RCom issue is resolved. So, while we talk of separate corporate ratings and separate entities, as far as lenders are concerned, you are one.We had enough stress in this period. There are just a handful of people who stood by me. People would not return calls, not want to engage, not want to be seen with me. You have to go through all of that. At times like these, you get a good feel and flavour of who is actually with you, who is standing by you or not standing by you, and who is making false excuses.If I went to my father with this and told him, he would have looked at me and said: “Why are you surprised? This is called tempering of steel. A steel rod goes into the fire and out, and in again and out again many times, and that makes it stronger. This is going to make you stronger.” We have emerged stronger.We did the Reliance Nippon IPO, a huge success. So, we were clear that brand equity of Reliance is very strong and will continue to strengthen and what we have achieved with RCom will further go to strengthen our equity.I think the whole concept of flagship is irrelevant. Each corporate entity is valuable by itself.How big a hit has brand Reliance taken?After 3G auctions, we needed Rs 10,000 crore, so we went to meet the head of CDB. A 65-year-old gentleman asked me about my father, read through the book on him written by my mother, asked me about my mother. Then asked how much money do I need. I said $1.3 billion. Asked for what it was. I said it was to participate in the spectrum auctions and to pay the government and to support exports from China. It was Monday and I had the money by Friday. He said, “I was trying to understand what you stand for, what is your value system, whether I can trust you and rely on you. And I am convinced, I can trust you and rely on you.”Sir, that is why the company is called Reliance. It saddens me to say this. All of us in the corporate sector, all of us so-called leaders, we have far, far more respect outside India than we have in India. And that saddens me, that our own country doesn’t value our own leaders.How badly did the issues related to RCom impact your other businesses such as infrastructure and power? What is the group debt?You will have a halo or a shadow around you at different times. If there is light, there will also be shadow on another side. Banks told me: “You will first need to resolve RCom.”Is that phase over?Yes. We are already seeing our proposals with various banks now moving ahead. The sharp rise in stock prices of our various listed companies, which had been beaten down for no fault of their own, also tells its own story.RCom in effect has shrunk. What does the future hold?New RCom will be stronger and be India's largest B2B business. It is capex light and we are very conservatively structured. If the revenue size is much smaller than the mobile market, then so it be. IDC (international data centres) business is set to explode. There is huge opportunity and as opportunity for India grows with $400 billion in reserves and good ratings, we will grow as well.I told DoT that I am not quitting telecom, I am exiting the mobile business. We are in cloud, IoT (internet of things), data centre, submarine cables.What according to you is the future of the mobile business?From a consumer perspective, in 2018-2019, consumer choice will shrink. We blame DoT, government, corporate rivalries. But there should be introspection. If we do not see something coming at us, we should not blame others.We saw the tsunami coming against us way back 2015-16 and started the process of consolidation. But today, as I see the future of mobile business, whatever size the industry structure may be, this sector is a cash guzzler. Our projections are that this sector will spend $100 billion over five years to keep up with technology and changing demands of the consumer.The industry has Rs 9 lakh crore of debt — Rs 2 lakh crore of foreign debt, Rs 2 lakh crore of bank guarantee and Rs 5 lakh crore worth of rupee debt. I wish people in the mobile business all the very best because the times are going to be very tough.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/i-am-neither-rich-nor-famous-i-am-just-a-common-man-anil-ambani-chairman-reliance-group/articleshow/62359599.cms

2018-01-04,"By Denise WeeThings are looking up for investors in billionaire Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. after the Indian phone company staved off insolvency by agreeing to sell assets to the chairman’s brother. But lenders still face a potential hit on their earnings.That’s the view of some observers including Pavitra Sudhindran, credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., who warns that provisions connected with nonperforming loans could sting. “That could hurt their earnings, though we don’t know the extent of the provisions they have already made and are yet to make,” she said.Such a development would underscore the challenges creditors to Ambani’s company still face, even after his brother Mukesh, India’s richest man, agreed last week to buy spectrum, mobile phone towers and fiber assets.The firm, which defaulted on its dollar bonds in November, said last week that there would be “zero loan write-offs” for lenders and bondholders. But creditors face several uncertainties, including the exact valuation of the deal with Mukesh, the timeframe over which the proceeds would be received, and how the proceeds would be divided among various creditors, according to a Nomura research note on Tuesday.A Reliance Communications spokesman was unable to immediately comment.Reliance Communications debt totaled almost $7 billion as of the end of the fiscal year ended March. Debts were nine times earnings, or the second-highest ratio among Asian phone companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The banking sector will have to make additional provisions of at least 10 per cent of their exposure to Reliance Communications for the quarter ended December if it is classified as a nonperforming asset, according to the central bank’s asset classification rules.“The Indian banking industry is going to see a spike in corporate NPAs and credit costs on account of this single company in the quarter ended December 2017,” according to a note published last week by analyst Hemindra Hazari on Smartkarma research platform.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-communications-lenders-seen-facing-earnings-hit/articleshow/62364248.cms
2018-01-05,"MUMBAI: China Development Bank (CBD) plans to withdraw its insolvency filing against Reliance Communications (RCom), leaving Swedish equipment maker Ericsson the sole foreign company battling to recover dues from the Anil Ambanicontrolled telco. The hearing in the case is slated for Friday in the National Company Law Tribunal.“CDB has already received some payment and is happy with the deal it is being offered,” said a person familiar with the matter. The Chinese bank, RCom’s largest lender, will still have the right to refile this application if the final settlement is delayed, the person said.It is unlikely that operational creditors — vendors with outstanding payments — and unsecured lenders will receive significant payments, if any at all, another person close to the developments said.Ericsson, an operational creditor, is aiming to recover Rs 1,150 crore from RCom, while CDB, a secured lender accounting for 37% of RCom’s total secured debt, has dues worth Rs 11,460 crore.“Yes, we will continue with the insolvency petition,” Ericsson said in an emailed response to ET’s query. RCom and CDB did not respond to ET’s queries on the matter. RCom is trying to find solutions to the problems of unsecured lenders and operational creditors, Ambani said at a media briefing late December.Ericsson told the courts earlier that RCom had not paid it dues for two years and only a few post-dated cheques were given. In September last year, it filed for insolvency in the NCLT to recover the dues from the operator for services and equipment supplied. Negotiations for an out-of-court settlement have failed.CDB moved the NCLT in November against both RCom and its subsidiary Reliance Telecom for its dues.But RCom Chairman Ambani said that the telco had reached an out-ofcourt settlement with Chinese lenders, without disclosing details.ET had reported that CDB and other Chinese lenders were in advanced talks to take up 70% in the development of Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City (DAKC).In an interview to ET, Ambani had said that all lenders were on board RCom’s plans to repay a chunk of itsRs 45,000 crore debt by March. The plan envisages selling its wireless assets, including spectrum, towers and fibre, for under Rs 24,000 crore to Reliance Jio, monetising its real estate assets in DAKC to generate Rs 10,000 crore, and divesting stake worth Rs 4,000 crore in the residual RCom, which consists of the global undersea cable business, data centres and enterprise business, to overseas private equity investors.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/china-development-bank-plans-to-withdraw-plea-against-reliance-communication/articleshow/62375940.cms

2018-01-05,"MUMBAI: China Development Bank (CDB) on Friday withdrew its insolvency filing against Reliance Communications (RCom), but Swedish gear maker Ericsson continued its battle against the Anil Ambani-owned telecom operator to recover its dues. Ericsson, operational creditor or a vendor who is owed by a client, is aiming to recover Rs 1,150 crore from RCom, while CDB, a secured lender accounting for 37% of RCom’s total secured debt, has dues of Rs 11,460 crore. Senior counsel Darius Khambatta, who represented both companies, said that since RCom’s plans to sell wireless and real estate assets, designed to generate funds to repay lenders, is up to March 2018, CDB is “accommodating” for the benefit of all creditors. The Chinese lender, however, warned that it retained the right to file an application again if it does not recover its dues from the telco, which is in the midst of strategic debt restructuring (SDR). While Khambatta didn’t spell out the specifics of any out-of-court settlement with RCom, ET had earlier reported CDB and other Chinese lenders were in advanced talks to take up 70% in the development of Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City. Arguing for Ericsson, Khambatta told the bench comprising Justices BSV Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy that RCom “has miserably failed to make payments” and listed out the multiple exchanges between Ericsson with RCom and its affiliates on dues for its services according to the contractual agreements signed in May 2012. The court will hear RCom’s arguments on January 18. ET on Friday reported CDB planned to withdraw its insolvency filing, while Ericsson planned to continue to fight it out. Shares of RCom surged 7% post CDB’s call, to finally close at Rs 34.05 a piece, up by 2.10% on the BSE on Friday. RCom, weighed down by Rs 45,000 crore of debt, had invoked the SDR programme in 2017. Last month, it announced that through asset monetisation, it will repay its lenders and exit the SDR process. The sale of spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes (MCN) to Reliance Jio for under Rs 24,000 crore is part of this strategy. In a regulatory filing on Friday, RCom said it is working ‘expeditiously'to close asset monetisation programme and “expects to close the same in a phased manner during January-March,” subject to approvals. “Asset sale proceeds shall be utilised to pay the company’s debt, including non-convertible debentures (NCDs) as may be decided by the joint lenders forum,” said the telco. “The company shall not pay or fix any record date for payment of interest on NCDs till the completion of the restructuring process.” CDB, which is RCom's largest lender and Ericsson, had moved the National Company Law Tribunal last November and September respectively, against the operator and its affiliates in a bid to recover its dues. According to the 2012 agreement, Ericsson was responsible for network management and maintenance and after initial few years, payments stopped coming in from 2016 onwards. “Payments became a dribble and then stopped. There was no dispute on the quality of service,” said Khambatta, representing Ericsson. According to court proceedings, the Anil Ambani-owned telecom company had assured that the dues would be cleared, detailing out the turbulence in the industry.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/china-development-bank-withdraws-insolvency-petition-against-reliance-communications/articleshow/62379700.cms

2018-01-06,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) unleashed another price disruption in an heavily debt-riddled industry, wherein all existing tariff plans with 1GB data have been revised to offer either 50% more data or a Rs 50 discount, amove which could hit the average revenue per user of rivals such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.The Mukesh Ambani-owned telco, with some 160 million users, has slashed the prices of four of its plans by Rs 50. So, for example, customers who were paying Rs 199 for 1GB a day will now pay Rs 149 for that amount of data for 28 days. To target the data guzzling subscribers, the new entrant has plans at Rs 198, Rs 398, Rs 448 and Rs 498 with 1.5 GB a day for 28 days, 70 days, 84 days and 91 days respectively. This means while a subscriber gets 1GB a day for Rs 198-199 under the price plan offered by the incumbents such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India, he or she will get 42GB data for a similar price under Jio.For 1GB a day, a customer can also opt for plans priced at Rs 349, Rs 399 and Rs 449 with validity of 70 days, 84 days and 91 days respectively. Competitor Bharti Airtel offers 2GB a day for Rs 349 which is valid 28 days. Jio’s Rs 399 plan, which has been amongst its most popular offer, has been revised to offer 20% additional data with increased validity of 2 additional weeks.Analysts say the new plans, available to the customers from January 9, could hit the average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key industry metric – of incumbents by 20-30%.“How can the incumbents match up? The ARPUs will take a severe beating since incumbents will now have to play catch up,” said a telecom analyst who did not want to be named. And if incumbents match what Jio is offering, their subscribers may want to opt for those lower priced plans, diluting ARPU.ET had earlier written that the industry under a debt of Rs 5 lakh crore has seen a 40% drop in ARPU in the September end quarter compared to same period last year.The telecom industry, engulfed in brutal tariff war, was hoping for stability this year, since the Mukesh Ambani owned telco had inched their tariff plans upwards a couple of times last year.Analysts say that the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology used by the operators is allowing the new entrant more flexibility, say industry analysts. “Jio uses VoLTE which allows more data services at cheaper costs while incumbents are on mainly on 4G LTE services and for them these new plans are cash guzzlers,” said a second analyst who did not want to be named as well.While Jio’s entire network is built on VoLTE while Airtel has just rolled out the technology for its users, and is expanding it across India. Vodafone and Idea have said they will roll it out shortly.“The telco (Jio) is covering customers across all price bands, ensuring more will join them and those who have been their subscribers remain satisfied with the huge data benefits,” said the analyst quoted above. Till now for Rs 149 plan in Jio, a subscriber would get only 4GB data a month.The new offers are meant for telco's Prime subscribers, who are the set of subscribers that have taken up the one-time annual membership fee of Rs.99.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-slashes-tariffs-again-may-hit-rivals-arpu/articleshow/62388378.cms

2018-01-09,"MUMBAI: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) today said it has filed an application before state electricity regulator MERC for approval to sell its Mumbai power business to Adani Transmission (ATL).""RInfra has moved an application before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) for its approval to assign its transmission and distribution licenses and transfer the integrated Mumbai power business to ATL,"" the company said in a statement issued here.The company has sought approvals from MERC for assigning its licenses and transfer the businesses to RInfra's wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Electric Generation and Supply (REGSL), which will then be acquired by Adani Transmission.In December last year, RInfra signed a definitive binding agreement for 100 per cent sale of its Mumbai power business with Adani Transmission for a total deal value of Rs 13,251 crore.In addition, regulatory assets under approval, which is estimated at Rs 5,000 crore and net working capital on closing, estimated at Rs 550 crore, will flow directly to RInfra. This will take the total consideration value to Rs 18,800 crore.With this deal, RInfra, which is sitting on a debt of nearly Rs 20,000 crore, would become debt-free, with up to Rs 3,000 crore cash surplus, the company said.RInfra currently caters to nearly 30 lakh residential, industrial and commercial consumers in the city's suburbs, covering an area of 400 sq km.In November, last year, RInfra completed the sale of its Western Region System Strengthening Scheme transmission undertakings to Adani Transmission for Rs 1,000 crore.The assets under the transaction include Western Region Transmission Maharashtra Project comprising 2,089-circuit km (Ckm) of transmission lines, and Western Region Transmission Gujarat project comprising 974 Ckm of transmission lines.With this acquisition, ATL's total network will be around 11,350 Ckm, of which approximately 9,000 Ckm are under operation.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/reliance-infra-moves-merc-for-sale-approval-of-mumbai-power-biz-to-adani-transmission/articleshow/62430423.cms
2018-01-09,"MUMBAI: The recent tariff reduction by Reliance Jio, which has already left the once-sunshine industry bleeding, will further delay a recovery in rivals' average revenue per user (Arpu) level, which is a key profitability gauge for the industry, warns a report.Reliance-run Jio had last week announced another Rs 50 reduction in its existing plans and/or 50 per cent more data per day on plans ranging from Rs 199-498.""The latest price cut indicates pricing discipline may still be uncertain and highly dependent on consumer behaviour despite industry consolidation paving the way for long-term structural improvements. This move will further delay Arpu recovery,"" India Ratings warned in a note today.""Although current competitive tariffs do not seem sustainable, the short-term Arpu outlook remains subdued, indicating another tough year for the telecom sector,"" it said.Two large telecoms registered an Arpu decline of 25 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, while Jio reported an Arpu of Rs 156 in the same quarter, which was higher than Rs 84 recorded by the industry.While for Jio the entire customers are in broadband data subscribers, for the industry this constitutes only 20 per cent. Non-broadband subscribers are typically low Arpu-generating customers.According to the agency, top telecoms would focus more on increasing their subscriber market share than revenue market share in 2018 and the dual-SIM phenomenon will continue for longer-than-expected, given the low customer loyalty and high price sensitivity.""Thus, the industry pricing trend is moving towards competitive on long validity plans (70-90 days) to increase customer stickiness,"" it says.Mounting pricing pressure, debt burden and capital outlay needs have led to the exit of small telecoms, while the larger ones have prepared themselves for the continued challenging environment through asset sales, besides industry consolidation.The agency had previously predicted a recovery in Arpu in mid-to-late fiscal 2019 as it had expected a stabilisation of industry tariffs at higher levels that would have led to user consolidation.Jio had increased pricing by 40 per cent last October but after that it had reduced the validity on the Rs 309 plan to 49 days from 84 days.

2018-01-10,"In an interview with ET Now, Manish Gunwani, CIO-Equity Investments and Amit Tripathi, Head-Fixed Income, Reliance Mutual Fund, discuss the outlook for the short and the long term. If the fiscal numbers are broadly in order, markets would stabilise over the next two to three months, especially the G-Sec part.Edited excerpts: We have put out two very interesting data points for Reliance Growth and Reliance Banking scheme. Reliance Growth since inception has given a CAGR return of nearly 24%. Reliance Banking Fund has also given a compounded growth return of 25% versus the benchmark. This is after commission and charges. A mutual fund document also contains a red herring line which is that past performance is no guarantee for future return. You have given great returns in the past but what does the future hold?Manish Gunwani: From a market perspective, while the valuations are slightly on the higher side, clearly the earnings cycle has been in the down cycle for a long period of time. So there are serious reasons to believe that the earnings rebound will happen over the next two three years because we are seeing almost unprecedented global growth which we have not seen for seven-eight years. We have a very low base because of GST, demonetisation etc. A lot of election related spending is likely to happen in the next 18 months. Given all these reasons, if we get a good earnings growth which we believe over the next two, three years, equities will continue to remain the preferred asset class for Indian investors and it should give somewhere in the double digit range over three to five years.Equity markets seem nonchalant about the weaker macro which is again odd but given the way the bond yields are moving, it seems that the bond markets are getting extremely stressed about the weaker macros, inflation and the overall impact thereof. Also, with the crude spiralling up at $68.5, do you believe that , these weaker macros are going to daunt equities or is there so much of a missed out feeling in the bull market and with gush of inflows coming in on a day-to-day basis, equity markets would continue to hold on?Manish Gunwani: It is a question of deciding where in the Indian business cycle we are? Are we in the early stage or the later stages? Any business cycle uptick either in India or in emerging markets in general is characterised by rising commodity prices and rising bond yields because by definition when growth comes back, these two will go up. Now the question is whether these are a symptom of growth and whether they lead to macroeconomic instability, typically manifested either in high inflation or high current account deficit. The question today is whether our bounce back in exports will happen because of global growth. Our bounceback in remittances and other foreign exchange earning items will offset the additional drain on forex because of higher commodity prices, especially crude. The key to track is not only crude prices, it is whether our trade deficit number goes beyond a certain threshold of about $15-16 billion.Right now, you are seeing crude as a negative effect on trade deficit but we also have to see as how this whole global growth paradigm supports our export growth. As long as we are below that $15-16 billion trade deficit. I would wait for that kind of indication to be really concerned about crude.What we are seeing in the bond and the fixed income markets is rising yields and falling prices. Now there are two ways to look at it; one, there is expectation that with the economy doing well or the economy recovering, things will look up. If with rising crude oil prices, inflation picks up, then there would be some sort of headroom to raise rates going forward. We are slowly and steadily stepping into a tighter liquidity environment globally and India is not an exception to that and which is why the Indian bond yields are also reacting to the same trend. However, Bill Gross is calling for a big bear market in bonds. So, there are two contrarian dominant views in the market where the jury is still out. Can investments in bond and fixed income markets still generate decent returns?Amit Tripathi: What the markets are clearly pricing is that the best of macro improvements are behind us. The macro improvements that we saw between 2014 and 2017. At least from an incremental perspective, the market does not seem to suggest that we are going to see incrementally more or better macro improvement that what we have seen in the past. If you look at the Indian context as the domestic macro matters much more. The two major variables that markets would anytime track would be the fiscal stance and the fiscal impact and second is inflation. Now while the track record of this government has been excellent, in terms of the fiscal track record, this year has been a bit of a let down from a market perspective given the additional borrowing. What the market is very closely looking at is how does the government approach the FY19 budget. Remember, that while there was some amount of bounty that the government did receive from oil excise duties etc there was some amount of heavy lifting also that the government was doing on behalf of the private sector since private capex was weaker. As we get into FY19, the market would very closely the track the fiscal numbers. If the fiscal numbers are broadly in order, the markets would stabilise over the next two to three months, especially the G-Sec part of it. As far as inflation is concerned, clearly last year’s average of below 4% cannot be repeated in 2019. We are clearly inching towards the 5% and above 5% kind of a mark. If you look at the average numbers for 2019, the oil prices are something that are concerning the markets right now. Unfortunately, oil has a triple impact on the Indian economy. It has impact on inflation, on current account and also on fiscal. So the market is clearly concerned there. The best way to play 2019 possibly would be to look at a combination of three things; one, would be obviously carry. Carry has improved across portfolios in fixed income schemes because of the recent increase in yields. Second, is to have a neutral duration stance given that the visibility in terms of macro improvements is not very great today, while it might stabilise again like I said incremental improvements might be more difficult to come by. And third is how do you play liquidity because there would be seasonality in liquidity, core liquidity still remains reasonably positive and you will see opportunities of making decent returns in products such as ultra short-term funds, short-term funds and FMPs. So, these would form the bulk of strategies clearly within the short term fund category which is doing very well in the last three years which will continue to do well going forward would be the accrual space as well. The neutral duration, focus on carry and wherever potentially you can get rolled on benefits is what the market would want to do more and more in 2018-19. Beside equity funds doing well all of last year and a flood of money coming into the markets through the SIP route, one key theme that stands out for investors is essentially investing in balanced funds. Those funds have also done well in trending market. Where is the opportunity balance that you see between equities and debt at this point? Manish Gunwani: Clearly balanced funds are a good way for investors to manage their asset allocation because it gives them a mix of debt and equity but it is very important to communicate to investors that recent returns should not influence their asset allocation and I guess it is always a natural tendency to look at equities the Nifty is up 30% last year and midcap index is up 40% odd.There is a natural inclination to allocate more to equities which is not advisable because the asset allocation has to be part of a long-term goal and while the balanced fund obviously offers a good mix of debt and equity, it is very important for investors to take into account their current asset allocation based on a mark to market and look at whether something like equities which has done well over recent times whether that is in control because you do not want people to flock to equities purely because of last one year returns. If someone has a long-term goal of say having 50% of net worth in equities, clearly it is not advisable that he or she goes to 70-80% right now. I do not think this is a market where you under allocate to equities but I also do not think it is a market where you over allocate to equities because on a valuation versus earnings growth trade off, you are somewhere in the middle. It is important for people to look at the overall equity asset allocation including the component of equity in balanced funds and keep it in line with the long-term goal.Amit Tripathi: If I can add from a fixed income perspective, the fixed income and equity themes we discussed here is that in portfolios where equity has an overweight in terms of overall allocation, the fixed income PEs has to essentially ensure that it gives a reasonable carry for the portion which is being invested into fixed income without giving too much of volatility.As an asset class, at least in the short run, equity as an asset class would have a slightly higher volatility. Our job here is to ensure that the stability that investors look for when they are investing in balanced funds is being provided by the fixed income allocation there which would typically been neutral duration with a reasonable carry so that investors keep on getting that comfort in balanced funds. Depending on the percentage of equity allocation, the fixed income support strategy would keep on changing. It would be different in a balanced fund whereas in MIP, the fixed income part might be slightly more proactive sort to sayManish, do you think 2018 could be a year of negative returns? We are debating that returns could be in double digit or single digit, but given world economies are unlikely to grow at the 3.2% they clocked in 2017, that global volatility is coming back, markets slowly and silently will recognise that crude is at $70 and macros are not looking great. What are the chances Manish and Amit that we could be in a year of negative returns?Manish Gunwani: I do think that volatility is too low for comforts. It is not only about equities. If you look at all major asset classes globally, whether it is currencies, commodities, bonds, and equities, the volatility is at multi-decade low. You have to budget for the fact that it will come back. Unlike last year, where equities had a unilateral secular run, clearly we have to be prepared for more volatility. However, I would not back a negative return purely from the fact that FY19 earnings are likely to be at the top end of double digits. In a year like that, it is very unlikely to get negative returns although in equities it is better to look at longer time frame as short-term tends to be volatile and could happen but I would not back it.Amit Tripathi: From a fixed income perspective, I would look at it in a slightly more optimistic manner. Once we have done our asset allocation which would predominantly be in the short-term accrual space, I do not think the chance or the case for negative returns actually arises because a large part of your returns has been made through carry. Any which ways we have been trying to tell investors at all points in time, which Manish also mentioned, volatility is one aspect which should never be underestimated irrespective of market conditions and hence you have to decide on the type of funds depending on the tenure. If you are only talking about a one year tenure here and you want to ensure that you do not get negative surprises of a one-year tenure stick to products which are focussed much more on providing a larger part of your returns to carry, stick to reasonable duration. Do not go for very high duration, if your investment horizon is just one year and I do not think you are going to get any negative surprises in spite of whatever is happening around us right now.What are thoughts on pharmaceutical and telecom sectors?. Do you sense contra money could in any which way find its way into these two segments of the market?Manish Gunwani: We are very positive on pharma as a space. We generally think that earnings bottom has happened in this year and from next couple of years, the earnings growth will be healthy. We have been saying that this is the theme which is very attractive at this point of time. We have been recommending our pharma fund which has a good track record of long-term wealth creation as a fund where people can allocate their money. The timeframe is a bit uncertain because when you have global growth lot of the cyclical sectors are likely to do well over let us say six months to one year but from a three to five years perspective, I think it is a sector which plays to India’s competitive strength in terms of talent, in terms of a scale of domestic business which allows companies to scale up and then export. These kind of competitive advantage are very strong in that sector. As for telecom, whenever industries consolidate, historically the equity returns in that sector have been very healthy. While it is a mature sector, the top line growth is not going to be gangbuster but given the fact that the margins and the capital intensity have seen their worst times, we think that the industry dynamics are going to improve from here on.As of now, markets are convinced that earnings recovery is round the corner. Now, this conviction has got challenged in last 12-18 months. What are the chances that we could be in for another round of disappointment on the private capex/economic recovery theme? If the earnings recovery does not start this quarter or next, will markets get impatient, will fund managers like you be forced to rethink your position in cyclicals or industrials?Manish Gunwani: You have to break it up between different parts of the economy. Frankly, from one-to-two-year perspective, we think that heavy private sector capex will come back but we also have to be cognisant of the fact that a fair amount of Nifty earnings or market earnings are linked to global growth. If you look at metals, commodities, energy, lot of exporters of manufacturing companies, they are all linked to global growth and what gives me lot of comfort today is as I said that after seven-eight years you are seeing the kind of economic data globally is very-very strong. That will definitely give a boost to earnings. Second, even on the domestic side, clearly the base is very low. If you look at metrics like bank credit growth, passenger vehicle sales, etc, on a five-six year CAGR basis, are low single digits which has not happened for 25-30 years. So, there are multiple reasons to believe that earnings growth will happen and in that part of the market, which is a bit more cyclical both on the global and domestic cycle, valuations normalised for cyclical earnings are not very stretched. I know that over last five-six years, we have started out maybe positive but ended up with 3% or 4% CAGR on Nifty earnings. I do think that from this base. next two-three earnings growth is going to be very strong.I was just looking at your holdings within the Reliance Equity Opportunities Fund and you have an exposure of about 7% to SBI. Do you see the opportunity in PSU banks or is it just the large cap names that you have conviction with?Manish Gunwani: We do have a preference for the large corporate lending banks with a high CASA ratio and good retail business. Basically, the strong parts of the franchise today are being clouded by credit cost related to corporate lending and if you look at next two-three years, a lot of the credit cost will trend down and the strength of the retail franchise will show up more and more in the numbers and these kind of stocks relative to market valuation look quite attractive. That is the kind of theme we are playing.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/for-next-2-3-years-equities-could-remain-preferred-asset-class-for-investors-manish-gunwani-reliance-mf/articleshow/62442280.cms
2018-01-11,"By Saket Sundria and Bhuma ShrivastavaRichest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s telecom venture is on course to record its first-ever quarterly profit this financial year, aided by the government’s decision to slash interconnection fees, people with knowledge of the matter said. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., a unit of the nation’s most valuable company Reliance Industries Ltd., may report a net income this month itself when it lays out its December-quarter performance, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.The crucial financial milestone would come less that 18 months after Jio, as the company is known, stormed into India’s mobile-phone market with free services that triggered a tariff war and forced consolidation in the sector. Achieving profitability would be one of the parameters that will decide the company’s path to an initial public offering after Ambani pumped at least $31 billion into the venture. Parent Reliance Industries has surged 77 per cent since Jio started operations and dislodged rivals to become the nation’s No. 4 wireless carrier.A Reliance Industries spokesman didn’t respond to an emailed query on Jio’s timeline for reporting profits.“We are ahead of our schedule in terms of the returns that we are generating,” billionaire Ambani had said at a Dec. 1 event without giving any timelines.Jio reported a surprise operating profit in the September quarter, the first time the unit’s results were segregated. It had a net loss of 2.71 billion rupees ($42.5 million) on revenue of 61.5 billion rupees.Costs have since declined substantially after a reduction in the fee an operator pays its counterparts for allowing calls to go through. The saving will flow directly into Jio’s net income, the people familiar said.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India reduced interconnect charges by 57 per cent to 0.06 rupees a minute starting Oct. 1 last year. The fee is set to drop to zero from Jan. 1, 2020.Jio spent more than Rs 21 billion on access charges in the quarter ended September 30, or more than a third of its revenues, according to a company statement.Interconnection CostsThe reduced interconnection costs will be pitted against any increase in depreciation charges and in the interest Jio pays on loans, which would erode net income. If these charges are high enough, the telecom unit may print a loss for the last quarter.“Unfortunately a (unknown) portion of costs are still capitalized as RIL has notyet commissioned its entire telecom infrastructure,” Sanjay Mookim, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst in Mumbai wrote in a January 9 note, explaining why Jio’s earnings numbers are hard to pin down.Cost structures are also likely to change once Jio completes the acquisition of spectrum, tower and fiber assets from debt-laden Reliance Communications Ltd. The deal won’t dent Jio’s December earnings as it is expected to close between January and March.Profits for Jio may be around the corner, boosted by a customer base that has swelled to about 160 million and tariff hikes in October, Jefferies analysts led by Mumbai-based Somshankar Sinha wrote in a Jan. 8 report.Telecom could turn profitable in the three months to December 31 despite higher capital charges, Sinha wrote in the report, describing it as “a quarter of many firsts” for Reliance Industries earnings.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-looks-all-poised-to-register-profit-in-december-quarter/articleshow/62457430.cms

2018-01-15,"A young Sajjan Jindal would attend the AGMs of Tata Steel, Birla Group and Reliance Industries to observe the industry leaders at work.  Today, the role of a good mentor in business is more important than ever, and most HNIs and industrialists are willing to share their knowledge with budding entrepreneurs. Some have even created platforms to exchange such ideas. The scene, however, was very different in the mid-1980s, as JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal recalls.  As a young entrepreneur, tasked with the job of turning a sick steel unit into a profitable one and creating a legacy of his own, Jindal didn’t have the “good fortune” of having access to such platforms. So, what did he do? He attended AGMs of other companies like Tata Steel, Reliance Industries and Birla Group.  From the AGMs, Jindal says, he gained insight into how the business leaders of the day tackled stressful situations.  “I would sit in a corner [at the Tata Steel AGMs] and look at the chairman [JRD Tata]. Even Dhirubhai Ambani. Every year, as a ritual, I would sit in the meetings and just observe them. What their reaction was,” says Jindal.  The way each industry leader handled shareholder queries or complaints also gave a peek into their personality. “For instance, Dhirubhai Ambani would react to the shareholders. If someone complained, he would respond very passionately. Aditya Birla would reply calmly, while JRD Tata would just make copious notes till the end of the AGM. Then he would say, ‘My CFO or company secretary will take care of all your questions’. So, as a young person, I learnt a lot from these stalwarts of Indian industry,” Jindal says.  Hero worship It’s no secret that Jindal is an admirer of Jamsetji Tata. When building his own steel factory, his benchmark was Tata Steel. “Jamsetji Tata built the steel plant when there were no drones or satellites to tell you about the location of minerals. Still, he could find the best location in the world to build Tata Steel,” Jindal says. “Jamshedpur is close to the iron ore and coking coal. There cannot be a better site in the world to build a steel plant. I often wonder how he managed to find such an amazing site way back in 1890-95. That’s why he was a real hero for me.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/master-class-sajjan-jindal-learnt-business-skills-by-attending-agms-of-tata-steel-reliance-industries/articleshow/62503130.cms

2018-01-16,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm may have garnered over 160 million users since it started its disruptive voice and data services in September 2016, but it isn’t the preferred destination of subscribers changing operators, brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report. The Mukesh Ambani-led 4G operator had a net 3.8 million subscribers who opted out of other networks at the end of October, a tiny proportion of the company’s overall users, according to analysis by Kotak. The trend shows that a Jio connection is not the primary number for a good proportion of its subscribers and a large number of its customers continue to also use the services of rival operators, Kotak said. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Jio were the only net gainers from mobile number portability, a facility that allows subscribers to switch their service providers without losing their mobile phone numbers, from the time it started in January 2011 until October 2017, according to data by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The analysis showed that Jio’s net port-in pace increased to about 0.7 million per month between June 2017 and October 2017 from about 0.1 million per month between September 2016 and June 2017. “It is important to note that until end-March 2017, Jio’s services were free and the customers did not really have to make a ‘which operator gets my spend’ choice. Once Jio started charging in April 2017, the customer has had to make a choice between similarly priced bundles of Jio and the incumbents,” Kotak said. According to the Trai data, Idea topped with 25 million net gains, followed by Vodafone and Airtel with 19.4 million and 18.4 million, respectively. Other operators lost a net 66.6 million subscribers, including 21.5 million users from Reliance Communications, 15 million from Tata Teleservices, 13.1 million from Aircel and 6.6 million from Telenor. Although the pace of gross portouts has increased for Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular in recent months, net port-ins remain in the positive zone. While Bharti Airtel lags Idea and Vodafone on cumulative net MNP gains, it has led since Jio’s launch with 9.1 million net gains since September 2016 compared with 6 million for Vodafone and 5.4 million for Idea, Kotak said. The data showed that Bharti’s outperformance versus Idea and Vodafone gained pace between end-June 2017 and end-October 2017, when Bharti gained a net 5million subscribers versus about 2 million each for Idea and Vodafone.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jio-not-preferred-operator-for-mnp-report/articleshow/62530640.cms

2018-01-19,"Despite weak expected refining margin, net profit of Reliance Industries (RIL) is likely to grow 13 per cent year-on-year to Rs 8,496 crore for the December 2017 quarter, according to Bloomberg estimates. A better performance by the petrochemicals segment due to commissioning of new plants will help the country’s largest private sector company by earnings to offset the impact of moderation in refining business.RIL, which owns the world’s largest refinery complex, is scheduled to declare its quarterly results on Friday. Earnings are likely to be driven by the petrochemicals segment, which accounts for almost a quarter of the consolidated revenue and onethird of the operating profit (EBIT) of RIL. The segment will be benefitted by new paraxylene plant and import of ethane. Under the ethane substation project, RIL would lower its dependence on feedstock such as propane and naphtha that are used in ethylene products. RIL has guided to add up to $300-400 million to FY18 due to the ethane import project.These factor will result in another record operating profit for the petrochemicals segment of the company. CLSA, a brokerage, expect petrochemicals volumes to increase by 25 per cent to 4,260 kilo tonnes (KT) in the December quarter compared with 3,386 KT in the year-ago quarter. The prices of most petrochemical products such as HDPE, LDPE, proplyene, paraxylene inched up 3-10 per cent on sequential basis in the December quarter. The EBIT of the petrochemicals division is expected to increase by 57 per cent year-on-year to Rs 5,182 crore.The oil refining business, on the other hand, may see some moderation due to softening of the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) — a gauge for regional refining margins. It is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of the refined products.The Singapore GRM dropped by $0.3 from the previous quarter to $7.2 per barrel in the December quarter as the realisations on petrol and diesel dropped.RIL’s GRM is expected to drop by $ 0.5 sequentially to $11.5 per barrel in the December quarter. Though the refinery volume is expected to remain flat compared with the previous quarter, the 4 per cent appreciation in the rupee against the dollar during the period may hurt realisation. Operating profit of the refining segment may rise by a tad 1 per cent year-on-year to Rs 6,255 crore.Company’s telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm, which turned positive at the EBIT level in the previous quarter, is expected to report net profit of Rs 25-250 crore for the December quarter. The fall in the interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise from 14 paise effective from the beginning of the December quarter will help Jio’s performance.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-q3-net-likely-to-grow-13-on-petrochem-boost/articleshow/62563476.cms
2018-01-19,"Private banks, housing finance and select private insurance companies still offer secular growth opportunities, says Sanjay Parekh, senior fund manager (equity), Reliance Nippon Asset Management. In an interview with Prashant Mahesh, Parekh, who manages Reliance Banking Fund with assets of ₹3,100 crore, reiterates that the outlook for banks looks better in 2019 and 2020. Edited excerpts:What is your outlook for the banking sector? The size of opportunity in banking is large as India is still an underpenetrated market. Any bank which has a strong franchisee on both asset and liability sides is best poised to take advantage of the upcoming economic recovery. Those with a higher retail book and the ones which are managing risk better have commanded premium valuations.We are seeing some signs of an economic recovery and this is showing in credit growth which is now at 11% from 5-7% earlier. We don’t have a full-blown recovery, but we certainly have a gradual recovery. The results will be visible in the March quarter. An economic recovery directly benefits the banking sector, as you will see credit offtake happening. We will see asset-quality resolutions falling in place and overall recovery in credit growth. Wherever credit growth happens, it helps them to participate in the lending cycle. All those things are work in progress, which will show results even in corporate banks where the retail part of the business has been doing exceptionally well.Banking stocks have been one of the best performers in 2017. How are valuations looking?Retail private banks are trading at a price to book of 3.5 to 3.8 times based on 2018-19 earnings. Public sector banks, including corporate banks, and adjusting for subsidiary values, have been in a range of 1.2-1.7 times, and are reasonably valued. If a recovery happens, you could see rerating for corporate banks and there is a good scope for that. However, we believe it would be in sync with the receding of asset-quality problems.How have PSU and corp banks handled the bad-debt problem so far?The bad debt issue is large. We have a ₹10-12-lakh-crore problem, and there is a provisioning of 35-40% on total stress. Every year, when provisioning is done, their coverage also goes up. Resolutions happen through M&A or insolvency proceeding. So, the problem reduces over time. Let’s say on a GDP of ₹160 lakh crore, the gross problem was ₹12 lakh crore. In two years, the GDP would be ₹190 lakh crore. So, if problem reduces and coverage improves, the impact of bad loans seen earlier will be less visible. Also, many stressed sectors like steel are doing well, due to the rise in prices. Gradually, recovery will percolate to other stressed sectors in 2019 and 2020. So, ultimately coverage will go up and credit costs will come down which will lead to higher return on equity (ROE). We believe that 2020 will look better than 2019.Where will you place your bets?We want a blend of private banks with retail focus and very less asset quality problems. We like corporate banks where the worst is behind us. In the next two years, banks with retail franchisee will see good appreciation. We believe there are secular opportunities in private banks, housing finance and select private sector insurance companies.Analysts believe NBFCs, mainly HFCs, are about to see a lot of stress while their valuations are rich...Housing finance companies are not cheap with valuations ranging from 3.5 times to 6 times price to book (P/B). Select NBFCs are expensive while in certain pockets, there is overvaluation as well. Wholesale borrowers which are not able to pass on higher rates could see a squeeze in margins. When the interest rates cycle was low, liquidity was ample, they benefitted as they did not pass on low rates. But now that the 10-year (benchmark bond) has gone up, it will reflect in incremental borrowing at higher rates and in select pockets they will not be able to pass on. Hence, one needs to be careful and take a case by case approach.There were a number of IPOs in insurance? Do you find value there?If you compare India with China, the opportunity in insurance is very large, due to low penetration. We are underinsured and there is product innovation in insurance. Private players are a decade old now, investing in strong franchisees, and return ratios are very good and they could look up further. Regulator is also supportive.

Last year, it was $10.8 per barrel but petrochemical would definitely be a big booster for the company and we are expecting a strong EBIT margin of around 18.3%.What is it that you are making of the stock price movement given the kind of expectations that the market has on the oil and gas front as well as the Jio business. The fact that the stock is already at 15 times the estimate of an EPS of about Rs 62 per share and given the kind of run up that we have already seen in the stock would you say that there is scope for the stock to move even higher if the numbers were as per the street estimates?Reliance has almost completed all its capex plan and the company is expected to give very strong results over the next two to three years. We believe that 15 times can easily go up to around 17 times as Nifty and Sensex are trading at much higher level. We believe that with strong performance continuing,, this multiple may go up. So we maintain our buy rating and we have a bullish view on the stock.On Reliance Jio, what kind of commentary do you want to hear on the expansion and what would you be expecting for in terms of subscriber addition for R-Jio?Instead of subscriber addition, the key thing is watch out for the company’s capex plan. We believe that your capex plan on Reliance Jio should be moderated and so quarter on quarter, we are expecting a significant slowdown in your capex and the guidance on the capex for FY19-FY20 so that would be a key trigger and definitely Reliance Jio subscriber addition and kind of data usage the company is having that is would be quite interesting to know and also the kind of ARPU that the company is generating because last quarter the ARPU was at a very high level. We believe that it should come down in this quarter but the kind of ARPU that company report would be a key thing to watch out for.What is the expectation on the petchem and the chemical margins for RIL? We are expecting it to be fairly strong this time?On petrochemical side, we are expecting about 4% quarter-on-quarter jump in terms of petrochemical EBIT and overall EBITDA is expected to grow by about 22% year on year to around Rs 130 billion and net profit is expected to grow by around 4% year on year to around Rs 83.7 billion.I know you talked about how petchem perhaps is of more significance at this juncture than the refining business for Reliance, but please throw in the numbers that you are expecting to hear from Reliance with regards to the GRMs. We are working with an assumption of $11.5 versus about $12 to a barrel on a sequential basis. What are the numbers that you are working with?For this quarter, our expectation is $11.5 per barrel and if you look at the light heavy differential and even the Dubai and Arab heavy differential has contracted by around $0.5-0.7 per barrel. Even on GRM side also, Singapore refining margins have come off. Overall, we are not expecting a very significant jump in your refinery EBIT but because of some of the inventory gains that the company is expected to report, we believe that refinery should also do well.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/petchem-to-drive-reliance-profits-this-quarter-sudeep-anand-idbi-capital/articleshow/62568912.cms
2018-01-19,"Talking to ET Now, Manish Gunwani, CIO-Equity Investments, Reliance Nippon Life AMC, says over the long term, he still thinks that double digit returns should be possible. Edited excerpts:Two weeks from now, the Budget will be presented. This will be the last full Budget of the current government. How exactly is the market positioned, approaching this budget in your view as a market master and a fund manager yourself? As an investor you want macro stability and so you want a low and credible fiscal deficit number. Second, you clearly want a big spend on infrastructure, a way of reviving the rural economy and one of the more important things could be a clear roadmap for PSU bank recapitalisation which has been announced but finer details will be appreciated by the market. The Budget is also a platform when the government actually comes out and talks about the income and expenditure and gives out a message to the market and various stakeholders of the economy. What kind of message would you want from the government regarding the shape of the economy and the sectors and areas they would like to focus more on? For all governments and in particular Indian government, the cost structure is broadly fixed. For the Indian government, almost 80% of salary cost, defence expenditure, interest etc. are broadly fixed. Therefore, the scope for constrainting cost is very limited. The best way to manage the economy from a fiscal deficit angle is to ensure productive expenditure which enables growth leading to higher tax revenues which will give you the top line growth to finally reach a lower fiscal deficit. My view has been that you present a credible budget and if the budget has a slightly higher fiscal deficit but you are able to convince the market than you are going to spend the money on things which improve productivity which keep inflation and current account deficit low, the market will look through the number and we will reach a phase where bond yields do not panic on fiscal deficit. That is the ideal way to do the budget to my mind. As a fund manager, how are you looking at the market right now? Overall, we have crossed 35,500 on the Sensex. The Nifty too is almost knocking at 11000. Are valuations becoming more challenging for you now?If you look at what the market has done especially on the mid and small cap side, clearly after the last 18 months, a fair amount of value has gone out of the market in the sense that the price to earnings, price to book valuations are reasonably high versus historical standards. But the good part is that from an earnings cycle viewpoint, over last four-five years. we have seen market earnings compounding at only 4% in economy when nominal GDP is much higher than that. We clearly think that the earning cycle is about to take off. Given these two effects we broadly think it is a middling market and you should have realistic returns. But over the long term, I do still think that double digit returns should be possible. The year gone by has been very good, particularly from the DII side in terms of flows, almost Rs 6000 crore coming in every month. How do you see the flows picture pan out in 2018? On the one hand, do you expect DII flows to continue and on the other do you see FII flows come back? How would this FII versus DII on the flow front pan out in 2018?If you look at what has been happening on the global front, emerging markets have been getting lot of flows. In the calendar year 2017, India got relatively less flows because the emerging markets, which had gone down a lot between 2011-2016, the commodity dominant countries like Brazil, Russia etc got probably higher allocation on flows. The emerging market as a basket seems to be growing very well and if that happens, I do see that emerging market funds will get flows and this year India will probably get a better allocation in which case the FII flows to India will be very strong. Earnings season is clearly panning out right now. How are you seeing the script from hereon? Do you expect earnings momentum to only improve? What has been your analysis of the numbers which have been declared so far?I do think that over the next two three years, we should get a very strong earnings cycle because global growth is strong. We are coming off a very weak year because of DeMon and GST. Elections are coming up and spending is expected to stimulate the economy. I do think we are heading into a couple of years of fairly strong earnings growth.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/want-a-credible-budget-with-productive-expenditure-manish-gunwani-reliance-capital-mf/articleshow/62569382.cms

RIL’s GRM outperformed the refining margins of the Singapore complex by $4.4 a barrel. Telecom arm Reliance Jio turned profitable in Q3. Jio reported a net profit of Rs 504 crore in Q3 of FY18 against a net loss of Rs 271 crore in the sequential quarter ended September 30, 2017.Commenting on the results, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh D Ambani said: “I am happy to share record-setting consolidated quarterly earnings to mark the 40th anniversary of Reliance’s listing in January 1978. Fittingly, this quarter marks the culmination of our petrochemical expansion projects and the first positive net profit contribution from our newest business line – digital services.”The company’s refining business delivered double-digit refining margins for the 12th consecutive quarter, demonstrating operating excellence and healthy industry fundamentals.Benefits of large investments in the petrochemical business are beginning to show with the segment reporting highest-ever earnings, the company said.December quarter revenue from the petrochemicals segment increased 47.6 per cent YoY to Rs 33,726 crore ($5.3 billion) on higher volumes and prices. EBIT for the petrochemicals segment came in at a record Rs 5,753 crore ($901 million) supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for polypropylene and downstream polyester products.The volume growth was led by the world’s largest ROGC coming on-stream along with downstream LDPE, LLDPE and MEG plants.Revenue for the oil & gas segment increased by 34.2 per cent year on yea to Rs 1,631 crore on commencement of CBM production and higher oil and gas price realisationOutstanding debt as on December 31, 2017 stood at Rs 2,13,206 crore ($33.4 billion) compared with Rs 1,96,601 crore as of March 31, 2017.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-q3-consolidated-net-profit-soars-25-yoy-jio-turns-profitable/articleshow/62571380.cms
2018-01-19,"NEW DELHI: The telecom regulator has directed Reliance Communications (RCom) and its unit Reliance Telecom (RTL) to return unspent balance and security deposits to customers after it closed voice services in several circles. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Friday said it has issued notices to the Anil Ambani companies, asking them to return the unused balance of the telcos’ prepaid customers and security deposit of the postpaid subscribers by February 15, and report compliance by March 31. RCom had told Trai in October 2017 that it would close 2G services in several circles from December 1. In November, RCom and RTL informed the regulator that both companies would close their voice services in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh and Mumbai, and in the licensed service areas of Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh, North East, Orissa, and West Bengal by RTL, with effect from December 29. In the last week of December, Ambani announced that RCom’s optical fibre network, towers and spectrum would be sold to elder brother Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm, to resolve its outstanding debt issue with lenders. The deal size is estimated to be Rs 23,000-24,000 crore. Trai’s directive is aimed at benefiting RCom’s prepaid subscribers who after the discontinuation of RCom’s 2G GSM and CDMA voice services were unable to port out to other networks.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/trai-directs-reliance-communications-to-refund-unspent-money-of-mobile-customers/articleshow/62571452.cms
2018-01-19,"Reliance Jio Infocomm posted a net profit of Rs 504 crore for the fiscal third quarter, its first within 15 months of start of commercial operations, buoyed by strong subscriber additions and cost efficiencies, including sharply lower payments on account of interconnect charges.The Mukesh Ambani-owned company, which upended the market since its entry in September 2016 with its initially free voice and data and now much cheaper mobile internet services, has posted a revenue of Rs 6.879 crore, up nearly 12% on quarter. India’s fourth largest telco by user base had recorded a net loss of Rs271 crore in the previous three-month period ended September, which was also the first quarter when it formally reported results.“Jio’s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives. Jio has demonstrated that it can sustain its strong financial performance,” Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries Ltd., also Jio’s parent.The new telecom entrant’s average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key performance parameter - stood at Rs 154, the same as in the fiscal second quarter. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) was Rs 2,628 crore in October-December period, surging over 82% sequentially, with an Ebitda margin of 38.2%, compared with 23.5% in the previous quarter.Jio, which added a net 21.5 million to end December with 160.1 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network which have more number of users, and is thus a net payer of interconnection usage charges (IUC), which were reduced by the telecom regulator by 57% from October 1. In the latest third quarter, Jio’s paid nearly Rs1,082 crore as IUC, less than half of the nearly Rs2,140 crore it paid in the previous quarter.“The (IUC) reduction will continue as IUC rates have been slashed,” Anshuman Thakur, Jio’s head of strategy and planning, told reporters. “We are creating enormous capacity. Costs have been incurred, now it will be on more revenue generated. That scale benefit is contributing to improving the profits number and this revenue will go up, not costs,” Thakur added, indicating higher profitability going forward.Network operating expenses was at around Rs1,737 crore, compared with nearly Rs1,372 crore in the second quarter, while depreciation & amortization costs rose a tad to Rs1193 crore from 1184 crore. Total expenses fell nearly 7% sequentially to Rs6,109 crore.Jio’s performance came a day after market leader Bharti Airtel posted a 39% on year drop in its net profit to Rs306 crore, hurt majorly by he cut in IUC and the ongoing price war, on a 13% decline in revenue, with ARPU at Rs 123, its lowest ever. Airtel’s India mobile business revenue was at RS10,751 crore, down 22% on year, while Ebitda at Rs 3,509 crore, slumped 34%.""The (Jio) results reflect a strong quarter the growth in data and subscriber base, which continues to be impressive,"" Mritunjay Kapur, head of telecom, media and technology at KPMG India.However, not all analysts were convinced.""The numbers in turning positive on EBIDTA & PAT are difficult to accept in such a short period given the high cost. But they're there, and it is quite clear that Rel Jio has benefited from IUC cut where others have taken a hit. Airtel's numbers are down and Idea will follow suit,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, an analyst at brokerage IIFL. Jio has come out with tariff plans across price ranges and even cash back offers to get more market share, and such offers will continue, said Thakur. “We will offer more to customers, we have the capabilities to do so. Cashback offer impact will be seen in the next (ongoing quarter),” Thakur said, also noting that the company had raised rates twice in the recent past.Chief Financial Official Srikanth added that the recent rate cuts by Jio were a reaction to competitors’ dropping prices.Total wireless data traffic in the quarter was 431 crore GB, far higher than its more established rivals such as Bharti Airtel which recorded 110 crore GB. Average data consumption per user per month of 9.6 GB while total voice traffic was 694 minutes per user per month. Airtel, in comparison, recorded 575 minutes per user, while data usage a subscriber was 5,349 MBs.Jio saw 1.4% of users moving to another network, compared with Airtel’s 3.3%.Debt stood at Rs51-52,000 crore, on an equity base of 100,000 crore. The company recorded capex of some Rs7,000 crore in the December quarter, said Thakur.On a buying spree, last month Jio inked a definitive agreement to acquire wireless assets of Reliance Communications and its affiliates in an all-cash deal for upto Rs 24,000 crore.“We are getting approvals (for closing the RCom asset buys). These are not related party transactions,” Thakur said.On being asked if Jio will be keen on the balance some 130 Mhz of spectrum that RCom still holds, Thakur said, “We will be looking at all spectrum available”.After a rapid start when Jio hit a record 100 million users in 170 days, the pace of subscriber addition slowed as it began charging for data – albeit at sharply lower rates than others – from April and due to the limited number of 4G smartphones in the market. The company then launched the JioPhone – the 4G VoLTE featurephone – and have claimed to have sold more than 600 million so far, in its attempt to target the 600 million odd basic phone users. “There were certain supply constraints that we faced, which have been overcome. Now you will see more of such phones, demand has been phenomenal and our way of empowering 530 million odd consumers who did not have Jio network,” Thakur said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-reports-net-profit-of-rs-504-crore-in-q3/articleshow/62571929.cms

2018-01-20,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries reported a 25% rise in quarterly earnings to a records, exceeding expectations, as its giant Jamnagar refinery again delivered hefty margins and the petrochemicals business boomed, while the Jio telecom unit that disrupted the market with cheap data and free calls quickly turned profitable.The company said the outlook for its main businesses is positive as it gains from acceleration in India’s economic growth and a favourable global environment. Consolidated net profit for the December quarter rose to Rs 9,423 crore while turnover rose 30.5% to Rs 1,09,905 crore from the year earlier. Standalone profit rose 5.4% to Rs 8,454 crore against expectation of Rs 8.394 crore.Reliance Jio Infocomm, the conglomerate’s newest venture, reported a net profit of Rs 504 crore in the quarter, making its first positive contribution to the balance sheet. Jio has grown rapidly since its commercial launch in September 2016. Its 160.1 million subscribers are using an average 9.6 gigabytes of data and 694 minutes per month, it said.“Jio’s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives,” chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a statement.Petchem Operating Profit up 73%“Jio has demonstrated that it can sustain its strong financial performance. We are excited about the prospects of both our energy and consumer businesses due to strong growth in Indian markets and constructive macro environment,” he said.CFO Alok Agarwal said the company expects to gain from stronger growth at home. “After some temporary headwinds in India, we are seeing acceleration in growth in India and strong growth across each of the products that we manufacture,” he said.The company’s petrochem segment, which is delivering strong earnings, is expected to make handsome gains from new capacities. “Our capacities in petrochemicals are coming on stream at a time when the global macro environment is positive and looks to remain so for several years,” Agarwal said.Ambani said the outlook was exciting with the Jamnagar refinery achieving impressive double-digit margins for 12 consecutive quarters, heavy petrochemicals starting to show results and bright prospects for the consumer businesses.The petrochemicals segment’s operating profit rose 73% toRs 5,753 crore, while EBIT margin expanded to 17.1% in the quarter from 14.6% a year ago.The refining and marketing business saw revenue rise 23% to Rs 75,865 crore in the quarter that saw crude prices rise to a three-year high. Refining margin, or the money it makes from producing fuels from each barrel of crude oil, rose to $11.6 in the quarter from $10.8 a year ago. Operating profit was Rs 6,165 crore, slightly lower than the yearearlierRs 6,621crore.The segment’s exports rose to $5.8 billion from $4.9 billion. Demand is buoyant, the company said.“Global oil demand growth is estimated at 1.5 m barrels/day for 2017 driven by growth in China and other Asia-Pacific markets,” it said. “The current forecast for global oil demand growth for 2018 is encouraging at 1.3 m barrels/day.”In the organised retail business, which runs 3,751 stores in 750 cities as well as 479 petro outlets, revenue more than doubled to Rs 18,798 crore from Rs 8,688 crore in the quarter in which it added 71 stores.

2018-01-20,"Reliance Industries Ltd.’s third-quarter net profit of a record Rs 9,423 crore exceeded street estimates by 12% and may reinforce investor confidence in earnings growth, which is being driven by the commissioning of new plants.RIL invested close to $20 billion in hydrocarbon projects, which started commissioning in phases in the previous financial year. The latest earnings could translate into an upward revision in the consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the current year.This could rekindle investor interest in the stock as returns in the past three months were lower than that of the benchmark stock index. The consensus EPS for FY18 stood at Rs 54.41 before the quarterly results, while the nine-month EPS of RIL in the current financial year is Rs 45. This indicates room for upward revision.The combination of higher volume growth in the petrochemicals business and profitability of Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom wing, were the principal reasons for the earnings bettering expectations.Revenue in the petrochemicals business increased 47% to Rs 33,726 crore due to higher volumes and prices. The switch to ethane that cut dependence on propane and naphtha as feedstock for ethylene production, helped RIL’s operating profit in the petrochemicals segment rise 73% to Rs 5,753 crore.The substitution project requires RIL to import 1.6 million tonnes of ethane from the US every year. The company has indicated that the ethane import project could add $300-400 million to FY18’s operating profit in the petrochemical segment and this appears to have started showing in the December quarter financials.Profitability will likely remain buoyant in the petrochemical segment as the company recently commissioned a $4.5 billion refinery off-gas cracker plant, which will produce higher value-added polymer derivatives with off-gas from its two refineries. The returns of the RoGC units are expected to be superior for the company thanks to the lower project cost compared with similar gas crackers installed in the US.The petrochemical segment helped to offset moderation in earnings of the refining segment due to softness in the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM)—a regional oil processing benchmark. GRM is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products.The Singapore GRM dropped by $0.3 from the previous quarter to $7.2 per barrel in the December quarter as realisations on petrol and diesel fell. As a result, the RIL’s GRM declined $0.4 per barrel to $11.6 in the December quarter from the previous quarter. The base GRM is expected to improve in the range of $0.8-1.5 per barrel with the commissioning of the pet coke gasification project worth $5 billion.The company said the pet coke project would be commissioned in the fourth quarter of the current year. Higher crude oil prices have a greater potential to improve the cost economics of the pet coke gasification project.Reliance Jio, the telecom division, posted its first quarterly profit of Rs 504 crore, which was almost double the street’s expectations, on a better operating profit. Jio’s operating profit improved to 38.2% in the December quarter from 23.5% in the previous quarter as interconnection charges were cut by 57%.With a subscriber base of 160 million and average revenue per user of Rs 154, Jio’s focus should now shift to monetisation of its industry-leading capacity. The street will keenly watch the trajectory of ARPU from its smartphone users, the ramp-up of its 4G feature phone, the launch of home broadband and the start of enterprise solutions.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-ltd-s-record-net-profit-of-rs-9423-crore-beats-estimates/articleshow/62577251.cms
2018-01-20,"Talking to ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says for Reliance, refining should do well but the petchem side of the business can be something of an outlier.Edited excerpts: ET Now:Reliance Jio profitability is at Rs 500 crore, what is your reaction?Mayuresh Joshi: It is a phenomenal number and after the last quarter when they had really done well both on the top line and on the EBIT front, it is a commendable performance to report profits specifically on the Jio business. Again, a large part of the market believes that a significant amount of capital expenditure on the telecom side is largely behind and to that extent, the incremental capex is going to be far lesser and the synergies in terms of pricing, specifically in terms of even their lowest priced pack should ensure that ARPUs are probably maintained and the trajectory remains on the higher side. It is a very positive number from Jio to help the consolidated numbers of RIL along with its core businesses. ET Now: The stock was up 1.5% going into the number, do you think it will witness some profit taking purely from the traders point of view with this kind of performance on Monday?Mayuresh Joshi: It is a possibility but the petchem business was operating out of a very tough environment because Reliance is an integrated player. They have probably seen better margins than most players at least on the petchem side because LDP, HDP prices have actually moved up. Even if you look at the deltas, the gasoline deltas were probably lower and the aiding aspect would have come from jet deltas. Naptha deltas are probably aiding that but with the off gas cracker coming through specifically on the petchem side, the future quarters numbers will look far better.At the same time, since they have started importing ethane, the costlier part of which was in the form of naptha, there will be significant cost savings happening on that front. And even the ethylene production should increase significantly. The petchem margins have been quite reasonable in my opinion and they should improve because of the integrated nature. The GRMs are on expected lines and over the next few quarters, as the gasifiers start coming through on the balance sheet in terms of that capex getting over again, it will prove to be the one aspect which can aid the earnings growth. A large element of the next few quarters is going to be at the core business earnings, showing stability and improvement in earnings metrics and that will improve the results as whole. It is a possibility that there might be some profit booking but remember it is a good set of numbers specifically on the EBIT front because of the tough environment that RIL was working at this point of time, specifically in the petchem. ET Now: How do you rate the refining environment right now? The trajectory around $12 has been maintained for six months now but there are sections of oil and gas industry globally which believe that refining may start turning soft going into 2018. What are your thoughts on refining as a whole for Asian refiners and refining margin trajectory?Mayuresh Joshi: For Asian refiners, there might be some marginal softness creeping through but the dynamics are very much in favour of large refiners because the kind of demand situation that we are seeing at this point of time and the kind of additions that we are probably seeing in terms of refining capacities getting put up, somewhere, the refiners are going to benefit because of this demand-supply dynamics. Secondly, if you look at how the core spreads are expected to pan out, it is a mix. Every quarter will probably see some amount of elevation or some amount of softness happening in either of the core constituents whether it is naphtha, jet or gasoline. The spreads is something very critical from a refiners’ perspective but somewhere the complexities that Reliance is able to manage and the way it does that because of the complexity of its refining plants, is the entire premise why it gets that premium of around $4 odd compared to the Singapore GRMs. To a large extent, the softness can happen but Reliance is a better place because of its complexities and demand supply dynamics. Going into 2018 should actually favour refiners more and the margins should get protected with not a great downfall in terms of margins getting deteriorated. Refining should do well but the petchem side of the business is something that can be an outlier for Reliance. ET Now: Do you think that is something that the street needs more clarity on whether or not the Jio business is going to suck in more money because it is a cash guzzling business?Mayuresh Joshi: Absolutely. And again, that is one important figure that the markets will tend to watch out for and largely the kind of moves that we have seen so far in terms of pricing moving up, pricing moving down, that environment can still continue. Blended ARPUs can actually get reported.The revenue market share that Reliance can actually garner going forward, what they do in terms of their capabilities on the fibre optic broadband is something to be observed, specifically in terms of R-Com assets. Further clarity from Jio could bring in higher estimates if they are able to clarify on an SOTP basis. But the core businesses are doing fine and as certain elements of their core businesses start coming through like petcoke gasifiers, the incremental earnings from the core businesses should come through. They did a $17-billion capex in FY17. If the capex is expected to taper off this year and in coming years as well, unless they have ambitious capex plan which then again reworks a lot of numbers.I remain positive on the stock. I am not ascribing any numbers unless I hear the concall, but the positive nature in terms of earnings outlook should continue and a disclaimer we own the stock in our funds.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/jio-numbers-phenomenal-helped-consolidate-ril-profit-in-q3-mayuresh-joshi-angel-broking/articleshow/62578319.cms
2018-01-20,"Within 15 months of starting commercial operations, Reliance Jio Infocomm turned profitable, posting a net profit of Rs 504 crore for the third quarter of the fiscal year. It had posted a net loss of Rs 271 crore in the previous quarter. It clocked a revenue of Rs 6.879 crore, up nearly 12% on quarter. Jio's rivals are facing tough times. Bharti Airtel's third-quarter net profit plunged 39%, missing estimates and dropping for the seventh straight quarter. Idea Cellular, too, is expected to post a loss as it has been doing for quite some time.A major reason for Jio's profit and loss of Airtel is the 57% cut in the interconnection usage charge (IUC) by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India from 1 October last year. IUC is paid by telcos generating calls to networks that receive them. Bharti Airtel, India's largest telco with over 289 million mobile customers, along with Vodafone India and Idea Cellular account for over 60% of the country's mobile users. They are net receivers of calls. With the in IUC, they were net revenue losers. Jio, which added a net 21.5 million to end December with 160.1 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network which have more number of users, and is thus a net payer of IUC. In the latest third quarter, Jio’s paid nearly Rs 1,082 crore as IUC, less than half of the nearly Rs 2,140 crore it paid in the previous quarter.While it's first quarterly profit is an important milestone and the IUC gives it an edge over its rivals, Reliance Jio's ascendancy is fuelled mainly by its disruptive strategy. The Jio juggernaut rolled into the market on low prices and freebies and it is likely to keep giving trouble to its rivals as its further sharpening it strategy. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani is the man who has his finger on the pulse of Indian consumer. In a speech at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence recently, Ambani said when the fashion was to invest abroad, Reliance took a contrarian bet to invest Rs 3.5 lakh crore in India and that has paid off handsomely. Ambani was talking of his telecom venture, Reliance Jio, that disrupted the sector with freebies and a flood of cheap data. After its smashing entry and now the first profit, Jio is making another contrarian bet. When retail companies are logging into India, Ambani is betting big on Bharat. Amazon and Flipkart may be putting billions of dollars in e-commerce wars, Ambani plans to ride high on the corner shops—the small kirana stores.

It will not spend its own money on discounts. It will only mediate between manufacturers and kirana stores to benefit its subscribers. While manufacturing brands will get free publicity, kirana stores will have more customers. And it will be an effective way to add and retain subscribers for Jio. The company is running a pilot project of this scheme at a few cities before it rolls out the scheme some time this year.The clever plan to link brands, kirana shops and consumers through the growing Reliance Jio network can spread like wildfire in the hinterlands. This will be yet another wave of disruption by Jio.The launch of Reliance Jio last year disrupted India's telecom market—and kept on disrupting it. Its stormy entry into $26 billion Indian telecom market riding on big freebies last year changed rules of the game. Apart from free voice for life, Jio didn’t charge for data for the first six months. It started charging for data from April 1, but at much lower rates than rivals. That wasn't the end of disruption. It came out with another disruptive ploy—a 4G feature phone, which was virtually free of cost, targeting predominantly rural feature-phone users who wish to switch to a smartphone but find it expensive. With its kirana venture, Ambani will prove that disruption is the chief strategy of Jio. He is sure to keep rivals on their toes.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/after-reliance-jios-first-profit-mukesh-ambani-is-ready-for-another-contrarian-bet/articleshow/62579912.cms
2018-01-22,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio's positive earnings played a decisive role in RIL's quarterly show, which was powered by the petrochemical business where margin surprised many. Analysts noted that the grandiose $20-billion capex too has started yielding results, pointing to a significant lift in earnings for Reliance Industries in days to come.Post results, analysts have upped the target of the oil-to-telecom major, suggesting up to 30 per cent upside from the prevailing level. CLSA has a fresh target of Rs 1,125 for the stock, from Rs 1,080 earlier, while Nomura India has a target of 1,220 on the scrip.The revision in targets has come at a time when another foreign brokerage UBS gave the stock a 'sell' rating on fears that $60-billion mega investments by the company are unlikely to start generating cash anytime soon. Reliance’s premiums to Singapore complex are likely to further widen as it starts its petcoke gasification project over the next few months, said Nomura India. ""Petcoke gasification (PCG) will use bottom-of-barrel petcoke as feedstock to produce higher value syn-gas. The syn-gas will be used as fuel in refining and petchem complex and release higher value off-gases for use as feedstock in refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC). Once fully on-stream, we expect PCG to expand Reliance’s premiums to SG benchmark by further $2-2.5/bbl,"" the brokerage said, adding that the refining and chemical cycle upturn since 2015 will likely last for another 24 months.The oil major on Friday reported a 25.10 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 9,423 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 7,533 crore in the year-ago quarter. Gross Refining Margin (GRM) for Q3 FY18 stood at $11.6/bbl as against $10.8/bbl in Q3 FY17. The company's GRM outpaced Singapore complex refining margin by $4.4/bbl. GRM is likely to remain strong due to structurally low utilisation in Latin America and Africa, which are home to 12 per cent of global capacity, said Motilal Oswal Securities. The brokerage noted that petrochemical deltas have shown strength due to strong demand and a delay in the commissioning of new projects in the US.""Although petcoke gasifier has been delayed further to FY19, completion of the rest of the projects would help generate strong free cash flow, going forward. For RJio, we maintain our DCF-based target price of Rs 245,"" the brokerage said. RJio recorded an Ebitda margin of 38.2 per cent in its second quarter of commercial launch, which was 440 bps higher than Bharti’s wireless Ebitda margin of 33.8 per cent, even as the RJio revenues were two-thirds of Sunil Mittal's company.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/strong-petchem-outlook-ringing-jio-set-to-rerate-ril-stock-further/articleshow/62600736.cms

2018-01-23,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) may soon topple Idea Cellular and Vodafone India individually in revenue market share, on the back of Mukesh Ambani-led telco's ability to spend more in capital expenditure. Jio’s revenue though is expected to surpass that of the Aditya Birla group telco in the fiscal third quarter itself, say analysts.""In our view, Idea could lose some market share in the near term as its spend on capex remains significantly lower versus Bharti/Jio,"" said brokerage firm Goldman Sachs in its report. It added that Jio’s reported revenues of Rs 6,900 crore likely translates into a market share rank of three. ""We forecast Rs 6,300 crore (wireless) revenues for Idea in third quarter,"" said Goldman Sachs.JP Morgan estimates Idea's revenues to be at Rs 6,700 crore. India’s current No. 3 carrier is expected to report a net loss—its fifth successive quarterly loss—in the October-December period, when it declares its third quarter results on Wednesday. In comparison, Jio, which upended the market since its entry in September 2016 with its initially free voice and data offerings, posted a profit of Rs 504 crore and a 12% on-quarter increase in revenue to Rs 6,879 crore for the third quarter. Airtel’s India mobile services revenue was at Rs 10,571 crore.At end of FY18, Goldman Sachs estimated revenue market share for Bharti Airtel at 31.7 per cent, Vodafone India at 21.4 per cent, Idea Cellular at 17.2 per cent and Jio at 12.1 per cent. By FY19, Airtel’s share is expected to slip to 30.6 per cent, Vodafone’s to 20.2per cent, Idea’s to 16.2 per cent while Jio’s is likely to rise to 21.5 per cent. Idea and Vodafone, which are in the process of merging operations, should become the combined No. 1 with a combined share of 36.4 per cent.The Kumar Mangalam Birla-led operator had in the beginning of the financial year announced a capex plan of Rs 6,000 crore and had utilised Rs 3,200 crore by the end of the second quarter. The balance amount was kept aside for the third and fourth-quarters. In contrast, Jio's capex for the third quarter was Rs 7,000 crore.According to analysts' estimates, Idea Cellular's average revenue per user (ARPU) for the third quarter will be around Rs 115 compared to Jio and Airtel's ARPU at Rs 154 and Rs 123 respectively. The slash in interconnect user charges (IUC) rates would “negatively impact” Idea’s mobile revenue by 10per cent on quarter, ICICI Securities said in a report. The decrease in IUC hurt Airtel’s gross revenue by Rs 1,061.5 crore, and mobile ARPU by Rs 16.Bank of America-Merril-Lynch in its report said Idea’s expected churn of 5.8 per cent, compared to Jio's 1.4 per cent and Bharti Airtel's 3.3 per cent.

The new offers are effective January 26.Under a recently revised plan, Airtel's subscribers will get 1.4 GB data per day if they recharge for Rs 199, Rs 448 and Rs 509. Those who recharge for Rs 349 will get 2.5GB data a day, as compared to 2GB earlier. Prices may vary according to circles, Airtel said.“Jio is playing a capacity game because if incumbents have to catch up, then they need to provide more data, which is difficult because they are yet to convert to VoLTE services,” said a senior telecom analyst who did not want to be named.Analysts say the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology is allowing the new entrant more flexibility, as it allows more efficient use of the same spectrum.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in a report that given Jio’s lower costs, it would always want its pricing to be 15-20% lower than that of its rivals. “Competitor response will determine future pricing,” BoFA-ML added.While Jio’s network is built on VoLTE, Airtel has just rolled out the technology for its users, and is expanding it across India.Vodafone has also just launched the service in Gujarat while Idea is testing it out. The analyst quoted above added that that the new plans could hit the ARPU of the players by 20-30%.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-gives-more-data-at-same-price-to-take-on-airtels-offers/articleshow/62628710.cms

Overall featurephone shipments surged by 51% on-year and a massive 32% sequentially, when compared to the 10-12% and 6-7% that the industry generally ships, respectively.“JioPhone brought in huge volumes in the quarter, due to which it was able to surpass Samsung, which typically leads this segment,” said Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint. “The device saw traction as featurephone users moved to the JioPhone and could use the similar form factor device to consume data as against the voice only earlier.”Jio has recently said it would look at a strong ramp up and relaunch of JioPhone from next month, after having resolved supply issues of battery and chipsets that had constrained shipments initially. It had sold over 6 million handsets in the first phase since start of bookings late August. Bookings were discontinued soon after, and resumed in November.People familiar with the matter added that Reliance Retail has shipped over 15 million JioPhones in the October-December period, of which most came in during the latter months. Of this, around 80% have been sold to consumers.Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio did not comment on future shipments, sales or tariff plans, while Samsung did not comment on the changed rankings.“There were certain supply constraints that we faced, which have been overcome. Now, you will see more of such phones,” Reliance Jio’s strategy head Anshuman Thakur had said.To make the JioPhone more attractive, Jio has further increased daily data allowance for Rs 153 a month plan, including Rs 99 as Prime membership for a year, associated with JioPhone to 1.5 GB from 1 GB, starting January 26.

2018-01-24,"Oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL) almost doubled investor money since January 23 last year, while equity benchmark BSE Sensex climbed 33 per cent in the same period.The RIL stock climbed 93 per cent from Rs 507 on January 23, 2017 to Rs 981.70 on January 23, 2018.Some analysts feel the stock may have gone up too much, too fast, thus throwing up a shorting opportunity.But chartists say if you are looking to short RIL at higher levels to make a quick buck, hold your horses. That shorting opportunity is not there yet. As both the market and RIL are on a strong footing, shorting the stock may not be a great idea at this point. The stock may be on the verge of a big breakout after registering lifetime highs after December quarter earnings, said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.He said traders should make use of dips to go long on this counter. “Best buying opportunity shall arise in the Rs 940-934 zone for a target of Rs 1,020,” he said.RIL posted a 25 per cent rise in third quarter profit on the back of higher refining margins and profits on the book of its telecom arm Reliance Jio.Consolidated net profit in October-December stood at Rs 9,423 crore while standalone earning grew 5.4 per cent to Rs 8,454 crore.Brokerage Edelweiss Securities says RIL’s core performance was mixed in Q3FY18 with refining EBIT coming in below estimate at 8 per cent, even as GRM missed estimate by 2 per cent. However, petchem EBIT surpassed estimate by 17 per cent amid robust volume growth, healthy polypropylene and downstream polyester margins and benefits from recent downstream projects.Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory says he does not see any shorting opportunity on the counter as of now.“The stock has achieved a breakout from a sideways consolidation of last three months when it moved past the Rs 955 mark. The retracement from the high of Rs 996 is nothing but a classical throwback,” he said.Throwback occurs when a stock returns to the same point from where it had broken out on the upside. Throwback mainly occurs because of the overbought nature of the security and this usually happens with lower-than-average volume. This was exactly the case on the RIL counter. Vaishnav expects the stock to take support around the Rs 953-955 levels. Only, if this level is breached, will the breakout fail and fresh shorting opportunity arise, he said.Brokerage firms Kotak Securities and CIMB have ‘reduce’ ratings on RIL with price targets of Rs 835 and Rs 770, respectively. Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Nomura and BNP Paribas Equity Research have ‘buy’ ratings, with price targets of Rs 1,210, Rs 1,120, Rs 1,035 and Rs 1,024, respectively.UBS has issued a ‘sell’ rating, with a price target of Rs 870. UBS analysts said RIL’s $60 billion spend on petroleum coke, gasification, petrochemicals and its telecommunications businesses won’t start generating cash anytime soon to help it pare debt.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/is-ril-presenting-a-shorting-opportunity-jury-is-still-out/articleshow/62633181.cms

However, at the time of writing, the website was not opening.According to a report, Reliance Jio Infocomm is drawing up plans to create its own cryptocurrency, Jio Coin. The new bet, a Mint report claims, is the mandate of a 50-member team working on blockchain technology, which is being helmed by Ambani's elder son Akash.

2018-01-24,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) has revised its tariff plans for the second time in two weeks, offering 500 Mb more data at the same price points, saying it was bettering bitter rival Bharti Airtel’s recent offers, underlining the continuing tariff war which will hurt average revenue per user further.The Mukesh Ambani-led telco, with some 160 million users, Tuesday said customers who were getting 1GB a day for Rs 149, Rs 349, Rs 399 andRs 449 plans will now get 1.5 GB every day with validity of 28 days, 70 days, 84 days and 91 days, respectively.Subscribers will get 2GB a day instead of 1.5GB per day if they opt for plans priced at Rs 198, Rs 398, Rs 448 and Rs 498 with a validity of 28 days, 70 days, 84 days and 91 days, respectively.“These plans have been launched as a response to Airtel’s tariff changes,” a company executive said. The new offers are effective January 26.Under a recently revised plan, Airtel's subscribers will get 1.4 GB data per day if they recharge for Rs 199, Rs 448 and Rs 509. Those who recharge for Rs 349 will get 2.5GB data per day, as compared to 2GB data earlier. Prices may vary according to circles, Airtel said. ""Jio is playing a capacity game because if incumbents have to catch up, then they need to provide more data, which is difficult because they are yet to convert to VoLTE services,"" said a senior telecom analyst who did not want to be named. Analysts say the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology is allowing the new entrant more flexibility, as it allows more efficient use of the same spectrum.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in a report that given Jio’s lower costs, the new entrant would always want its pricing to be 15-20% lower than that of its rivals. “Competitor response will determine future pricing,” BoFA-ML added.While Jio’s entire network is built on VoLTE, Airtelhas just rolled out the technology for its users, and is expanding it across India. Vodafone has also just launched the service in Gujarat while Idea is testing it out.The analyst, quoted above, added that that the new plans, available to the customers from January 26, could hit the average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key industry metric – of the players by 20-30%. That is because many of the subscribers would want to now move down to lower rate plans, which offer similar data benefits, thus hurting revenue.Jio clocked in an ARPU of Rs 154 compared to Rs123 of Airtel for the quarter to December. Idea’s ARPU, which too has been falling, is expected at around Rs 115 when the company reports results Wednesday.To get customers at the lowest price range possible with highest data offering, Jio now is offering 2GB for 28 days for Rs 98. Incumbents Bharti Airtel and Vodafone for Rs 98 and Rs 99 offer respectively its customers 1GB for the same period. Jio, in its third quarter results, had said that it will continue to offer 20% more than competition to its customers. This will be Jio's second tariff revision in the new year and price war is mainly on data packages. Brokerage UBS said Jio’s management had suggested the company’s focus on market share gain and offering higher value to customer compared to incumbents. “We believe APRU increase for the industry is more likely a CY19 story as top three operators continue to vie for market share stability in CY18.”The Mukesh Ambani-led company, which upended the market since its entry in September 2016 with its initially free voice and data offerings, posted a profit of Rs 504 crore and a 12% on-quarter increase in revenue to Rs 6,879 crore in the three months ended December.The new offers are meant for telco's Prime subscribers, who are the set of subscribers that have taken up the one-time annual membership fee of Rs 99.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-republic-day-offer-50-more-data-on-offer-various-plans-now-cheaper-by-rs-50/articleshow/62621667.cms

The company recorded a robust 59.2 per cent growth in retail revenue in the financial year 2015-16,"" said the report on global powers of retailing by Deloitte Global.The retailing subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL), also operates in the apparel and accessories space with its Reliance Trends and Reliance Footprint nameplates, and in hardlines through its Reliance Digital consumer electronics chain.""The India retail story continues to be promising. Having faced demonetisation and GST, the retail sector in India will soon be poised for a CAGR of more than 10 per cent in the coming year,"" Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte India said.""Opening up of FDI for single brand retail trade has provided a stimuli for global retailers to decide their Indian entry and presence,"" he said.The consumption potential continues to be strong and attract retail companies to focus on new ways of tapping the Indian market. Digitisation and technology are predicted to play a key role in the strategy of the Indian retailer, the report noted.Some of the trends as stated in the report are sighted in India as well like innovation, collaboration, consolidation, integration and automation.""Further, these need to be looked at from the lens of the young consumer. Thus, the overall theme of transformative change and reinvigorated commerce resonates well with the Indian retail market,"" Talreja added.With the advent of these trends in India as well as regulatory support, it is very likely that Indian companies will start showing up on the global list very soon in the coming years, he further pointed out.The retail growth in the country has been strong all along, in part due to the fact that the country is not dependent on commodity exports.Lately, growth has decelerated owing to the temporary effect of structural reforms such as demonetisation and implementation of a new goods and services tax.Yet the longer-term outlook remains strong, especially as those reforms are likely to have a positive long-term benefit, the report said.It pointed out that top 250 global retailers generated aggregated revenues of USD 4.4 trillion in 2016 fiscal year, representing composite growth of 4.1 per cent.The top five largest retailers maintained their positions on the leader board.""A combination of organic growth, acquisitions and exchange rate volatility shuffled the rest of the Top 10-which now accounts for 30.7 per cent of the overall Top 250's retail revenue, compared to 30.4 per cent last year,"" the report said.Europe's share of the Top 250 dropped again, with 82 retailers based in Europe and the gap widened versus North America, it added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-breaks-into-top-250-list-of-global-retailers/articleshow/62635685.cms

This is the second ""implied tariff"" cut by Jio this month and signals Jio's intention to continue to focus on sub additions until it reaches a particular scale. Jio also introduced a new plan for Rs 98 that provides access to 2G data per month - this looks more like a feature phone offering,"" the report said.Jio's closest rival Bharti Airtel data cost per GB has dropped to Rs 4 under its new schemes.The tariff of Rs 2.7 per GB data is about 99 per cent lower compared to Rs 249-259 per GB charged by established big operators till August 2016 -- before commercial launch of Jio services.Jio's announcement of Republic Day scheme, under which users will get 500MB extra data per day across existing plans, within days of Airtel announcing the scheme priced at Rs 399 offering 1GB 4G data daily with 84 days validity.""It is very logical to assume that, after Jio's strong signalling at its analyst day, Airtel knew that Jio would follow up on any tariff cut. Despite this, Airtel launched these new offers. We believe that it is investing heavily to build a strong network that can sustain high traffic. We now see the market moving to 1.5GB per day plans from 1GB per day.

Jio’s latest tariff cuts are likely to further drag ARPU – a key performance metric -- by another 20-30% in the coming quarters.Unlike Jio, which clocked in a strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the December quarter, Airtel and Idea’s fell to Rs 123 and Rs 114, respectively, stung by the cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC), which compounded pressures on their voice and data businesses amid continuing price wars.Morgan Stanley said Jio’s new plan could trigger “churn of low-end 4G data users from incumbent carriers to Jio, or tariff down-trending” if Airtel, Vodafone and Idea match the tariff.“A 10% churn of Airtel’s low-end 4G data subscribers could lead to 3% and 8% impact on its India wireless revenue and Ebitda respectively, and a 4% impact on its consolidated Ebitda,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.Alternately, if Airtel matches Jio’s Rs 98/month 4G plan, the US brokerage said the move would lead to “2% and 6% impacts” on the market leader’s India wireless revenue and Ebitda respectively, and “3% on its consolidated Ebitda”.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said Jio’s Rs 98/month tariff plan “looks more as a feature phone offering,” coming as it does when the Mukesh Ambani-led telco’s JioPhone has become the No 1 feature phone brand in the quarter to December by shipments, overthrowing market leader Samsung in the segment for the first time.“With these implied tariff cuts (from Jio), incumbent telcos may not see positive operational leverage, which pushes the recovery story further out and also makes the ARPU improvement story more gradual,” said Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.According to analysts, the fact that Jio also generates much more data traffic on its 4G network than all incumbent carriers combined would only exacerbate the financial blues for the Big 3 of Indian telecom.Swiss brokerage UBS, however, downplayed the potential impact of Jio’s Rs 98/month tariff plan, saying it is likely “to be a niche plan with a limited subscriber base as the data allowance of 2GB is significantly below other plans”.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jios-new-mass-connect-plan-to-further-hurt-incumbents-analysts/articleshow/62640542.cms

2018-01-29,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm is gearing up to harness Internet of Things (IoT), focusing first on enterprises and industries while initiating talks with car manufacturers and consumer durable companies as well, among others, for the consumer segment. The 4G entrant has brought on board Ayush Sharma from Silicon Valley as senior vice president of engineering and technology, to drive the business around IoT and other technologies such as mobile edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence and blockchain.“Jio is looking at these technologies to enable world’s largest programmable network with alternate technologies available,” Sharma said. “It will take at least around a year to enable consumer IoT, but the large focus is on enterprise IoT. We are working on specific use cases.”Sharma has joined the company after working on his own venture, MotoJeannie, in the United States, and has worked for telecom gear makers Huawei and Ericsson, and Cisco in the past in the US. At Jio, Sharma is building a team of engineers to deploy and develop these technologies.“The idea is not just to launch IoT products and solutions for consumer IoT but also for enterprise and industries,” Sharma said, adding that the parent company, Reliance Industries, is looking to use these technologies initially within in-house verticals such as retail and logistics to make them intelligent. For consumer IoT, Jio is working with a variety of technology vendors and bringing car manufacturers, consumer durables and appliances players, among others, on board to build a complete ecosystem, Sharma said. “We are building our own platform with big data strength,” he said.Jio’s 4G network will complement IoT for enterprise and industrial use cases that required bandwidth and latency, he said.The company had recently said that it had started offering enterprise solutions along with fibre-to-the-home on a trial basis in a few locations.It also has a plan to roll out home broadband-powered home automation that will allow users to convert basic electronic products into smart products with the installation of six-seven smart plugs. These smart plugs will allow users to control the entire home with the help of smartphones or tablets.Jio is also planning to launch a complete suite of home surveillance comprising smart camera, smart doorbell, smart lock and chime alarm. All these products can be managed from the user’s mobile devices, ET had earlier reported.The company’s bigger rival, Bharti Airtel, is also planning to enter the home automation or smart home segment with its IoT and machine-to-machine solutions in a move aimed at expanding its revenue base. The home automation segment is in its nascent stages and real application of use cases and processes have just started to crystallise for the industry. According to a study by Zion Market Research, the global smart home market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.5% between 2017 and 2022. The market revenue is expected to grow from $24.10 billion in 2016 to $53.45 billion by 2022.Jio plans to focus on leveraging the open source ecosystem to unlock potential in the telecom sector. Sharma, who was involved in the ONOS project, an open source community hosted by The Linux Foundation, will also be involved in the open source related efforts.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-now-looks-to-disrupt-iot-space-in-india/articleshow/62690233.cms

2018-01-29,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio’s Rs 49 per month offer to JioPhone users could force the top three telecom operators — Airtel, Vodafone and Idea — to switch off their 2G legacy networks and shift to more cost-efficient VoLTE-based 4G networks to protect their rapidly falling average revenue per user (ARPU), analysts said.They said that the latest JioPhone offer — the sector’s lowest price plan offering free voice for life and a GB of data at 4G speeds over a 28-day validity period — is likely to attract many more low-end 2G voice customers across India who have so far hesitated to adopt 4G.Brokerage JP Morgan said the offer “would draw 2G voice subscribers” away from Airtel, Vodafone and Idea as “Jio’s feature phone pricing is as much as 30-50 per cent cheaper than incumbents’ rates”.This is expected to cause more financial pain to incumbents as it comes on the heels of Jio’s equally aggressive Rs 98 per month 4G entry-level price plan that is already estimated to shave off ARPU, a critical performance metric, of incumbent telcos by up to a third in the coming quarters.The 2G feature phone user segment, the US brokerage said, constitutes a whopping 70 per cent of India’s billion-plus mobile user base garnering as much as 50 per cent of sector revenues.According to data collated by the telecom regulator, the ARPU of prepaid users is Rs 70, of which the voice ARPU of feature phone users is in the Rs 50-60 range.Brokerage Motilal Oswal said “the latest JioPhone price plan would be at nearly 10 per cent discount to the average feature phone subscriber ARPU”.The telecom sector, already plagued by brutal price competition and debt of Rs 5 lakh-crore, has had another poor quarter. Unlike Jio, which reported a strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the quarter to December, Airtel and Idea’s fell to Rs 123 and Rs 114 respectively, stung by the cut in interconnect rates, which compounded pressure on their voice and data businesses amid continuing price wars.Kotak Securities said Jio’s latest pricing moves targeting millions of 2G feature phone customers of incumbent carriers would further damage the latter’s already weak financials, forcing them to take tough calls like shutting down their 2G and 3G networks ahead of current plans and rolling out VoLTE-based 4G networks on a war footing.“We wonder if there is an economic case anymore for incumbents to keep their 2G networks running if the JioPhone even sees modest success,” Kotak said, adding that “the ultra-expensive 900 MHz spectrum that incumbents are using for 2G would fail the impairment test as 2G spectrum”, especially since the steep cut in mobile termination charges has “anyways killed the incoming ARPU leg of 2G network economics”.According to Kotak, Jio’s aggressive Rs 49 price point also suggests “Jio has ironed out all supply-related constraints on the JioPhone”, a view also endorsed by Deutsche Bank.The German investment bank said Jio had indicated at a recent analyst meet that it had “worked with its Chinese vendors to build inventory prior to the current JioPhone offer”, although “the price plan is lower than expected”.The JioPhone, which was launched by Jio’s sister company, Reliance Retail, comes for a Rs 1,500 deposit, refundable after three years on return of the device. To avail themselves of the refund, subscribers need to recharge for a minimum Rs 1,500 a year.Under the new plan, JioPhone users would need to top up the minimum monthly charge of Rs 49 with additional sums to reach the Rs 1,500 annual recharge figure, if they wish to avail themselves of the full refund. Part refunds are also allowed for those surrendering the device earlier.Sector experts expect the latest price move to intensify competition with incumbents who are already dishing out cashback offers on their alliances with smartphones. Recently Idea, Vodafone and Airtel announced cashback offers on their 4G smartphones, bringing down the effective price of the devices to under Rs 1,000.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jios-rs-49-per-month-offer-may-force-airtel-vodafone-and-idea-to-shift-to-volte-based-4g/articleshow/62685940.cms

Reliance Jio takes a serious note of such fraudulent attempts by unscrupulous persons to misguide the public in the name of Jio and reserves the right to take appropriate legal recourse,” the new telco said.Et had reported in its January 30 edition about the existence of fake websites peddling Jio Coin, a crypto currency reportedly in the works from Reliance Industries.

2018-01-31,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular may seek to compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm’s Rs 49 per month offer by unveiling attractively priced tariff plans with some data bundled in to keep the new telecom operator from cornering millions of their 2G feature phone users.“There is always a possibility of coming up with a similar bundled plan or something even more compelling than the Rs 49 JioPhone offer to hold on to our significant feature phone user base,” a senior executive of one of the top three telecom operators told ET on condition of anonymity, without specifying a time frame.Feature, or basic, phone subscribers using mainly voice on 2G account for 65-70% of India’s billion-plus mobile user base and 50% of sector revenues, thereby making it critical for India’s older operators to prevent migration to the new entrant, according to analysts.Jio’s Rs 49 a month offer – the sector’s lowest price plan offering free voice for life and a GB of data at 4G speeds over a 28-day validity span – could help the newest mobile carrier eat into the feature phone user base of incumbents who currently dominate the 2G market, unless they come up with aggressive matching offers quickly.Swiss brokerage UBS said it “would not be surprised if incumbents respond to Jio’s price plans, albeit at a 10-30% premium”.Goldman Sachs said a likely response by incumbents to Jio’s new feature phone plan could be bundled offerings at similar price points, but in tie-ups with handset vendors.Brokerage CLSA, however, said incumbents run the risk of taking “a 10% hit on ARPU (average revenue per user) and revenue” if they retaliate and match Jio’s offer. Idea, with higher operating and financial leverage, would be “at a greater risk”, it said.ET’s queries to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular on whether they would match Jio’s Rs 49 per month offer did not elicit any responses till late evening on Wednesday.The telecom sector, already plagued by brutal price competition and debt upwards of Rs 5 lakh-crore, recently had another poor quarter. Unlike Jio, which reported a strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the quarter to December, Airtel and Idea’s fell to Rs 123 and Rs 114 respectively, stung by the cut in interconnect rates, which compounded pressure on their strained voice and data businesses amid continuing price wars.Jio compounded worries about a prolonged price battle after it recently cut rates twice in quick succession, including the Rs 49 a month for the users of JioPhone, the 4G VoLTE feature phone.In the interim, another option for the incumbents would be to discontinue their unlimited validity plans on the prepaid services platform to contain potential ARPU losses triggered by Jio’s latest offer.At present, about 30% of the country’s mobile phone subscribers (roughly 300 million) are estimated to be on unlimited validity plans that generate monthly ARPU of as little as Rs 25.Brokerage CLSA said incumbents could “mitigate the risk of ARPU fall by 50% by putting an end to their unlimited validity prepaid plans”, which would force a subscriber to recharge each month and thus increase his or her monthly spending and nearly double revenue flow on such plans.Nitin Soni, director at global rating agency, Fitch, however, downplayed the risk to incumbents, saying, “It remains to seen how many existing 2G users actually opt for the new JioPhone offer as the 4G data experience on a small-screen feature phone will be very limited.”Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said the Rs 1,500 initial deposit for the JioPhone is a likely put-off for many customers.The JioPhone, which was launched by Jio’s sister company, Reliance Retail, comes for a Rs 1,500 deposit, refundable after three years on return of the device.

2018-02-04,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Communications has opposed the telecom regulator's directive asking the company to refund unspent balance of mobile subscribers, in the wake of discontinuation of its voice services.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is, however, of the view that the demand on customer refunds is fully justified as it pertains to premature closure of services by an operator, and therefore, cannot not be equated with general network port outs cases.A senior Trai official told PTI that since it is the case of a service provider closing services the ""customers must get their unspent balance"".""The situation is not similar to general port out by a consumer, where consumer chooses the timing of porting out from one network to another network.Here, a service provider has closed services and therefore protection of consumer interest is a must"" added the official who did not wish to be named.Reliance Communications (RCom) declined to respond to an email query on the issue.However, sources familiar with the development said that the service provider has shot off a letter to Trai arguing against the regulator's January 19 directive on refunds.In the letter, RCom has cited the Mobile Number Portablity Regulations 2009 to highlight that the existing rules mention that the balance amount of talktime at the time of porting ""shall lapse"", the source pointed out.""We regret to say that we are unaware of the exact regulation under which a provision exists for refund of balance amount of talk time on a mobile number being ported out for any reason whatsoever ... we request authority to withdraw the direction ... "" the source said quoting from RCom's written representation to TRAI.Meanwhile, RCom is preparing another follow up letter to Trai where it has further argued that there is no precedence of customer refunds being sought in several other cases of operators closing down services in the Indian telecom market.On January 19, the Trai had directed Reliance Communications (RCom) and Reliance Telecom (RTL) to refund the unused balance of their prepaid customers and security deposits of their post-paid subscribers and report compliance in the coming weeks.The direction for refund is ""pursuant to closure of 2G/GSM, CDMA services and discontinuation of voice services in all the licensed services areas by Reliance Communications Limited (RCL) and Reliance Telecom Limited"".The move comes at a time when RCom has announced plans to sell its spectrum, towers, optical fibre network and other wireless assets to Reliance Jio, the telecom firm of elder brother Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.The industry estimates the blockbuster deal to be valued at Rs 24,000- 25,000 crore.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/reliance-communications-seeks-withdrawal-of-trai-directive-on-subscriber-refund/articleshow/62777062.cms

2018-02-06,"KOLKATA: Increasing import duty on toys and artificial jewellery will do little to cut the country’s dependence on Chinese imports in these sectors, according to domestic players, who say the government should instead raise the local industry’s ability to compete better.The Budget has proposed to increase Customs duty on toys and artificial jewellery to 20%. Domestic manufacturers say that dependence on Chinese-made toys and costume jewellery cannot be brought down immediately because of their lower prices and Indian units’ inability to match their products due to poor infrastructure. “The increase in import duty will not help the Indian manufacturers immediately. At the retail level, Chinese toys enjoy 80% shelf space,” Manish Kukreja, president of All-India Toy Manufacturers Association, told ET. “This matrix cannot change within a very short span of time. What the government can do is keep stricter watch on entry of Chinese toys through illegal routes.” The Indian toy industry is worth about Rs 9,500 crore.“The government has to take a holistic approach and ensure price stability in raw material for helping the domestic toy industry,” said Kukreja. “Cost of power in India has gone up by 55% in the last five to seven years, whereas it has gone down by 19% in China. Labour cost is also high in India. If we have to compete with Chinese toys, we need to bring down our cost.”Ishmeet Singh, country manager-India, Mattel Inc, said, “As per Budget 2018, there has been a substantial increase in Customs duty to 20% for toys and sports goods. This, combined with the other policy changes that have been implemented over the last six months—which include higher rates of taxes under goods & services tax (GST) and strict import regulations-—will result in an overall increase in the price of toys by 20%.”Electric toys attract 18% GST against the earlier 12% value-added tax (VAT) while other toys attract 12% GST versus 5% VAT earlier.While Chinese toys have nudged out locally manufactured ones in retail stores, cheap artificial jewellery from China has also flooded the costume jewellery market, estimated to be worth about Rs 13,000 crore. The trend is supported by the rising price of gold which pushes buyers towards these items.Import duty on artificial jewellery has been increased from 15% to 20%. “We cannot bring down our dependence on costume jewellery from China. They have now become part of our system,” said Rajesh Chheda, a leading costume jeweller from south Mumbai. “There are customers who want those jewellery and we cannot lose them. Prices will definitely go up by 15% -20% from April.

2018-02-06,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has slammed Reliance Communications (RCom) for trying to ‘pocket’ the unspent pre-paid balances and security deposits of its mobile subscribers after shutting down its wireless operations, and warned of action if the telco failed to refund users’ money.“We have responded to them (RCom), saying either you refund or face action,” Trai Chairman RS Sharma told ET. “They don’t have any moral, ethical or legal basis to say that they can’t refund the money.”Sharma said that a back-ofthe-envelope calculation shows that RCom has some 50 million customers. “And if there is an average ?30 balance for each customer, they (RCom) will be enriched by ?150 crore. RCom will have to refund,” Sharma said.RCom didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.Trai issued a notice last month to Anil Ambani-owned RCom and its unit, Reliance Telecom, to refund the unused balance of the telco’s prepaid customers and security deposit of the post-paid subscribers by January 31. This, after RCom said it was shutting its wireless operations.RCom responded by asking Trai to withdraw its directive and cited mobile number portability (MNP) rules to argue its case that it is not required to give the money back. The company added that it wasn’t sure under what provisions the regulator had asked RCom to refund the money. The telco wrote a follow-up letter, pointing out that there was no precedent of customer refunds in other cases of operators closing down services in the country.“This is ridiculous. On the one hand, in a way, RCom has left the customer high and dry, and now it has the audacity to say it will not refund the money,” Sharma said, adding that the regulator has received thousands of customer complaints.“We have given directions under the relevant provisions of the Trai Act. We have powers to give directions to RCom,” he added.Further, Sharma said that MNP rules are made for normal situations when customers have the option of shifting between two operational operators.“What is happening today is a very exceptional situation. In a normal MNP case, I typically exhaust all my balance before I port out because I know I won’t get a refund. But in this situation, the operator (RCom) has shut down services, so the consumer doesn’t have the opportunity to exhaust the balance. Therefore, this is a very abnormal situation,” Sharma explained.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/trai-slams-reliance-communications-for-refusing-to-refund-consumers-balance/articleshow/62808703.cms
2018-02-07,"By Bhuma Shrivastava and Saket SundriaReliance Jio Infocomm’s first-ever net income is “a bit too good to believe” for Sanford C. Bernstein analysts, who examined how the phone carrier accounts for some costs.Jio’s “unique approach” results in a slower pace of recognizing depreciation and amortization, which led to a 12 billion rupee ($187 million) charge in the December quarter, according to a Feb. 2 Bernstein report. Using a rate similar to local rivals would have quadrupled that number and turned Jio’s reported profit into a loss of Rs 2,410 crore, analysts led by Hong Kong-based Chris Lane estimated.The carrier, controlled by India’s richest man and a unit of Reliance Industries, posted a net income of Rs 504 crore last quarter, about 16 months after its debut sparked an industry price war that crashed revenues. The result was boosted by Jio’s policy, linking depreciation charges to “its own assessment” of usage and economic benefit, while other Indian carriers amortize telecom assets at a fixed rate over time, Morgan Stanley said in a Jan. 21 report.An email seeking comment from Jio’s spokesman went unanswered.“It’s part of accounts engineering. The assets will depreciate over time whether you use them or not, whether you use them partially or fully,” said Anil Singhvi, founder of Ican Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd. This approach is “just a way of saying I’m profitable sooner,” he said by phone, adding that the focus should instead be on cash flows.Reliance shares traded 0.5 per cent higher at 896.45 rupees at 1:14 p.m. in Mumbai while the benchmark Sensex was little changed.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom unit launched with free services in 2016 and went paid 10 months ago. Morgan Stanley estimates Jio will turn cash-flow positive in the 12 months through March 2020.Bernstein analysts pinned Jio’s profit down to three factors: lower network costs possibly due to favorable tower-sharing deals, reduced interconnect fees and its method of accounting for depreciation which “stands out as an anomaly” when compared to global peers.Jio, which had 152 million subscribers at the end of November, has elbowed aside rivals to become the nation’s No. 4 wireless carrier. Bharti Airtel Ltd. is in the top spot with soon-to-be-merged Vodafone India Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd. at No. 2 and No. 3 respectively.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/worlds-top-investment-research-firm-finds-reliance-jios-first-profit-too-good-to-believe/articleshow/62817626.cms

Domestic consumption will rise to 443 mt in 2035 and 533 mt by 2040.The proposed addition includes plant expansion and debottlenecking as well as new projects. A 60-mt refinery planned in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra jointly by Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum is the biggest new project. HPCL is planning a 9 mt new refinery at Barmer.If all the new capacity comes online by 2030, Indian Oil will still be the biggest refiner with a total of 116 mt.ET View: Boost Renewable EnergyThe projections suggest that the demand for conventional fuels would keep rising in the medium-term and well beyond. The energy economy is indeed large and growing. There’s huge scope to boost new, renewable and alternative sources of energy. But it seems likely that even as the latter segment grows by leaps and bounds, the former conventional energy sector would stay relevant for years, perhaps decades. Hence the need for proactive policy and attendant resource allocation to fast-forward the expected transition in the energy system.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/state-refiners-ril-and-rosneft-plan-expansion/articleshow/62829227.cms

Balanced funds are typically recommended to investors who do not want to take much risk, whereas smallcap funds are meant for investors with very high risk tolerance level.Do you have the required risk appetite to invest in a smallcap scheme?

2018-02-15,"Essar Oil has sold its entire production of coal-seam gas or CBM from a West Bengal block to state-owned GAIL India Ltd using the same formula that Reliance Industries used for pricing of its CBM.GAIL will buy 2.3 million standard cubic metres per day of coal-bed methane (CBM) that Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (EOGEPL) will produce from its Raniganj block in West Bengal for USD 7.1 per million British thermal unit.According to an evaluation of bid posted by Essar on its website, GAIL outbid Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, Graphite India Ltd and Positron Energy Pvt Ltd to bag the supplies.The price is more than double of the USD 2.89 per mmBtu price set by the government for most of the domestically produced conventional natural gas.Essar used the same formula which Reliance Industries had first used in 2012 to seek bids for its CBM gas from its Sohgpur block in Madhya Pradesh, and then again last year for selling the CBM. In the first instance, the oil ministry had not approved the price.Like RIL, Essar had sought bids for potential users in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document.GAIL bid a deductible of 1.89, which translated into a gas price of USD 7.12 per mmBtu (on gross calorific value) at today's Brent oil price of USD 64.80. At three-month Brent crude average of USD 65.8, the gas price comes to USD 7.23 on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.Interestingly, GAIL had in the similar bid process run by RIL last year for 3 million standard cubic metres per day of Sohagpur CBM gas quoted a deductible of 3.495. RIL had bid a deductible of 1.836 to win all the supplies.RIL's Sohagpur gas at today's oil price comes to USD 7.15 per mmBtu on GCV basis.The formula used by RIL and Essar is the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to import long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.EOGEPL had invited bids from prospective buyers of gas based on a government notification dated April 11, 2017, which lays out a policy framework for the early monetisation of CBM gas.The policy provided marketing and pricing freedom at arm's length price in the domestic market to contractors of CBM blocks.EOGEPL has invested about Rs 4,000 crore in the Raniganj East CBM block in drilling wells, setting up supply infrastructure, and laying customer pipelines to Durgapur and nearby industrial areas, according to the company.The block has 348 completed CBM wells, alongside robust gas and water handling capacity.The Raniganj East block is India's most prolific CBM block, which has achieved gas production of more than 1 mmscmd (million standard cubic metres per day), which will be gradually scaled up a saleable volume to 2.3 mmscmd.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/essar-sells-raniganj-cbm-block-to-gail-using-reliance-formula/articleshow/62934615.cms

It is a midcap fund. It has an impeccable long term track record. Post-2008 stock market crash, the fund had its own set of challenges. However in the last 3 and 5 years, although the fund has beaten its benchmark, it has underperformed its category average. It has beaten both its benchmark and category average in the last one year. Having held so long, you can continue to hold on to the fund. It would be a good idea to start an SIP in the same folio or add during market downturns.

2018-02-19,"Talking to ET Now, Sanjay Parekh, Reliance Mutual Fund, says RBI’s guidelines for recognising asset quality pain via upfront provisioning getting higher coverage, augurs well for the banking system in the long term.Edited excerpts:Let us first start with what is happening in the banking space. There is a huge fraud which has been discovered in PNB and which could have repercussions for the entire sector per se. What do you think this kind of news will do to PSBs at large and PNB in general? We may not be able to comment on a specific stock but broadly of course this is a headwind. But, we believe that this should not spiral and it would not be pervasive. Essentially, if you read this with the RBI guideline, around Rs 8 lakh crore was gross NPA and another Rs 4 lakh crore was through RBI dispensation or SMA-2 or watch list. What RBI guideline said was that you accelerate recognition of NPA, do accelerated provisioning and that would mean higher credit cost for banks which have higher stress and ROA and ROE. This event is of course a dampener but we really believe that the Rs 80 lakh crore credit is not small and markets would see through it. What will follow after that is of course the accelerated recognition to NPA. If the resolutions are in place, then they will move into insolvency proceedings and whether we have bandwidth there has to be seen. But very clearly, we will see accelerated recognition of NPA, accelerated provisioning, higher credit cost and hence less ROA for fourth quarter for sure and of course for FY19. Just when it appeared that PSU banks had recognised all the bad loans, they had swallowed the bitter pill, the books were cleaned up and then they were on road to recovery, an accounting fraud has been discovered. So, for an investor, do you think the messaging is very simple that PSU banks may be cheap but they deserve to be cheap because of poor standards?Yes, there will be surely flight to quality. We have seen this time and again in banks the world over. If you remember, the European banks crisis or even the US crisis in 2008, whenever the sanctity of book is in question, they get derated very much. But when the sanctity of book is restored, there is re-rating and what RBI is doing is getting more sanctity of the book being written which is very good in the long term. In newer terms, such instances do have ramification on specific banks and the overall segment as well. But we believe in the clear larger names -- PNB itself was a very large bank -- but other than that, certainly you need to be top of the line in PSU banks and the smaller ones will have issues on credit quality, on credit cost and definitely in the interim phase they will have challenges.I do not want you to comment on individual stocks but Tata Steel outbid on Bhushan Steel and offered cash of nearly Rs 35,000 crore and 12% equity to creditors. Bankers may have to take a good 27% to 30% haircut. What is your own view on this entire resolution and whether or not the banking sector which in any case is just dealing and grappling with so many NPA issues, can take a such a large hit in light of this resolution?You rightly said that the good part is we have got encouraging bids for a few of the steel assets but we still have the rest of the bids to come and in some of the segments, the bids may not be very encouraging. We will have to see in toto and then we have another 28 companies and then the ones which we expect around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which is either in RBI dispensation which can move 180 days after 1st March or if there is no resolution to IBC. So, we are going to have around 5 lakh crores of cases in IBC and we will have to see the resolution. There is a lot of supply of assets. The promoters rightly cannot participate. There is enough private equity money for the right assets but certainly they would have their threshold of returns and in certain segments, you will see fewer takers and the process is going to take a little longer. While there is lot of good work happening in terms of NCLT codes, the government, the RBI, the bankers, the insolvency professionals, this is a time-consuming process. We will have to be patient. It will be gradual. You have seen some very good bids which is encouraging for the banks because the haircuts would be less, but we will have to watch more of them coming through which is particularly in power we think that the haircuts will be larger than what we have seen in metals. Metal has been certainly a good case.Besides Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel as well as Electrosteel, they have also seen very high interest from investors. Do you see steel sector haircuts to be contained at sub-50%. What would this mean for PSU banks and corporate banks in particular like an ICICI Bank as well as Axis because they too in the same vein have been falling like nine pins all of last week?This is a tailwind. In steel assets particularly, there will be less haircuts and that would mean write-backs in certain cases. In one of the cement companies, the bids have been very encouraging and that is very good. All this put together, around Rs 1.2-1.5 lakh crores assets are being bid quite well. But, for the rest of them, we have to see what is the response, what are the haircuts, whether some of them can go into liquidation and what is the response to those assets.This is very clearly quite encouraging and while we have had this case of fraud which we think is an isolated case, there is clear tailwind in the better bid for Bhushan Steel and we will also see hopefully in Bhushan Power. We have seen that in Binani and I am very sure it will be the same in Essar because all the steel assets are running quite well right now.Also, they are doing quite well and once the transfer happens, they will actually start paying interest at a point on the revised structure. There are encouraging signals but the verdict is yet not out that is what I would say.HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI are your top holdings. Wonder why there is no IndusInd Bank in the list.As you would have referred my fax sheet, we have owned Bharat Finance which is going to be in the process of merger into IndusInd Bank. Without getting into names, we like the private banks which have a retail presence, less asset quality issues and in a calibrated manner, we like the large corporate banks which have its pain but we think that in 2019-20 they would look quite good. Having said that, large corporate banks will also have their share of pain in the fourth quarter of this year and in FY19. But the franchise they have on the retail side -- both the asset and liability side -- are very strong and that is getting underappreciated and the size of the balance sheet is large for them. They are all adequately capitalised. They are not in dire need of capital.As I said, the retail piece is doing quite well and they can move into better ROAs and ROEs in FY20 shortly. We believe that despite this headwind and as per RBI guidelines, it is actually very good over a long term. I believe that in FY20 and in the next 10 years, these guidelines will actually be a blessing for the banking sector. When you do a surgery, there is pain but it is very good for the patient in the long term. I very strongly believe that these guidelines of recognising asset quality pain upfront provisioning getting the coverage higher augurs quite well for the banking system in the long term.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/large-corporate-banks-will-have-their-share-of-pain-in-q4-sanjay-parekh-reliance-mf/articleshow/62981450.cms

2018-02-20,"NEW DELHI: India’s older carriers have slammed the telecom regulator for a series of regulations over the last 12-18 months which favour only new entrant Reliance Jio at the cost of the existing ones, and said the latest tariff order on predatory pricing violated the ‘fundamental right’ of incumbents to carry out business.In a statement Tuesday, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) called on the government to urgently intervene, saying that regulations and policies that were not based on fair play would further aggravate the financial stress in the industry, kill future investments and leave thousands of jobs at stake.“For some reason these orders seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators…regulation after regulation put out by TRAI has ended up in distorting the competitive landscape in favour of one operator, while putting all other operators at a serious disadvantage,” COAI said.The body, which represents all major operators in India including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Jio, said the Mukesh Ambani-owned new telco – which started operations in September 2016 and triggered a price war which had hurt the revenue and profitability of India’s existing telcos - didn’t subscribe to these views.Rajan told ET that COAI members, except for Jio, will decide over the next few days whether to move court against Trai’s amendment to the Telecom Tariff Order (TTO). The regulator couldn’t be reached for comment while Jio didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.Friday, Trai amended its tariff order, saying predatory pricing henceforth will be determined on the basis of average variable cost and whether there is specific intention on the part of a carrier to reduce or kill competition. It also changed the definition of significant market power (SMP), which a telco needs to have for any of its plans to be deemed predatory, to an operator with more than a 30% share by either subscriber base or gross revenue. Earlier, the SMP parameters included volume of traffic, including data, and switching capacity.In a note to clients, brokerage BNP Paribas said the tariff order “restricts predatory pricing by players with more than 30% subscriber/revenue market share (read:Bharti Airtel, Idea-Vodafone combine) but puts no restrictions on promotions of Jio, which is the dominant player in data with four times more volumes than Bharti or Idea-Vodafone”.COAI’s Rajan said after the changed SMP parameters, “victims have now been made the perpetrators…one operator (read: Jio) who by its own admission is the world’s largest data network may be free to offer any sort of predatory tariffs while older operators are now subject to regulation and cannot compete without falling foul of a new definition of what constitutes predatory pricing.”It also noted that Trai’s latest tariff order that mandated telcos to do away with segregated offers or those provided to retain subscribers “in the garb of transparency and non-discrimination”, took away to a large extent the older operators’ flexibility to counter any subscriber poaching attempt.“In effect, older operators will now be challenged on the basis of revised definition of SMP so as to be prevented from responding to what may be actual ‘predatory tariff plans’. Even more strangely, they will find it practically difficult to offer any discounts/provide benefits to retain their customers if a competitor chooses to poach them, effectively taking away their ability to compete and conduct business,” COAI said, adding this violated the fundamental right to carry out “any occupation, trade or business as enshrined in Article 14 and 19(1) (g)” of the incumbent operators.The body accused Trai of going against the views of all private telcos, except for Jio, on allowing discounted/customized offerings to customers, and accepting the suggestions of only the new entrant.“In fact, it appears the Trai has copy pasted the demands of this one operator across a range of definitions in the new TTO,” COAI said, and gave examples of its claims.COAI said that the industry, which was already reeling from the “regressive regulations” such as cuts in Mobile Termination Rates – which cost incumbent operators over Rs15000 crore a year and benefited Jio by nearly Rs10,000 crore rupees – and in International termination charge, which lowered forex revenue to the government by Rs2000 crore rupees, has now been dealt a “near fatal body blow with the recent amendment to Telecom Tariff Order (TTO).”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/coai-slams-trai-for-biased-rules-favouring-reliance-jio/articleshow/63002196.cms

In its notice, the telco said it is within its rights to take COAI and the three top incumbents to court , seeking damages . ""COAI and Rajan Mathews are hereby called upon to issue a public apology and issue appropriate clarification expressly regretting their callous and defamatory statements through a separate press release issued no later than 48 hours from receipt of this notice,"" said the Ambani owned company in its notice to COAI. The Ambani owned firm has also said that it reserves ""its rights to initiate criminal and civil defamation proceedings, including for damages, against both COAI and incumbent dominant operators (IDOs), jointly and or severally"" . COAI on Tuesday, accused the telecom regulator of issuing a series of regulations over the past 12-18 months, including the latest order on predatory pricing, that allegedly favour Reliance Jio, which started services in September 2016. COAI, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular did not respond to ET's queries on the notice. The notice termed the COAI's comments as"" reckless, wilful and flagrant act of making slanderous and libelous accusations "" against Jio. The latest entrant in the telecom industry demanded that operators' association ""immediately cease and desist from publishing false and defamatory imputations"" against Jio. Jio alleged that COAI used to be the ""official voice of the Indian Telecom Industry"" but has now been reduced ""to becoming an instrument and mouthpiece of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (including Telenor, now controlled by Bharti Airtel)"".Jio alleged the cellular association of scuttling any ""regulatory development aimed towards greater fair market access for new entrants and greater transparency and lowered costs for the consumers"". The Ambani owned operator in its grievances against COAI said that it did not reach out to Jio for its opinion before sending out its release on Tuesday and is being used to put forth the interests of the incumbents at the cost of the industry at large.The notice said the dominant incumbents ""conspired and deliberated on the matter, and instigated the COAI to issue the Press Release with malicious intent to cause harm to the reputation"" of Jio. COAI in its earlier statement had said that Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) tariff order amendments was ""strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of otheroperators. According to Jio, COAI blamed the operator for reforms that will benefit both industry and consumers. The operator with 160 million subscribers said COAI's comments that TRAI'S decision to slash interconnect user charges or definition of predatory pricing would benefit Jio was false and defamatory. Jio also highlighted COAI’s comments on how the latest predatory pricing rules will benefit “one operator”. The crux of the matter in Trai’s latest order is flexibility on pricing given to operators with less than 30% of subscribers and revenue, which top three telcos contend benefits Jio. According to the amended tariff order, predatory pricing would telco’s average variable cost and whether there is specific intent on the part of a carrier to reduce or kill competition. The telecom regulator too has dismissed as “baseless” allegations by India’s top three operators that its recent rulings and policies are biased against them and said the companies are free to move court if they find any anomaly in its orders. Cellular operators have “got into the habit of making allegations that are baseless and lacking in substance,” Telecom Regulatory Authority of India secretary SK Gupta told ET on Wednesday. Jio in its notice said that these rules will apply to all telcos and will not benefit anyone in particular.The telecom industry for the past year and a half has been at loggerheads. Reeling under more than Rs 7 lakh crore of debt and facing a sharp fall in revenue, profitability and free cash flows, forcing many operators to shut down or merge with larger players.

Earlier this week, the industry body had accused the telecom regulator of issuing a series of regulations over the past 12-18 months, including the latest order on predatory pricing, that allegedly favour the new operator, which started services in September 2016.It added that Jio did not subscribe to its views. In its notice, the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco, called COAI a ‘mouthpiece’ of dominant incumbents and accused it of making “reckless, wilful and flagrant act of making slanderous and libellous accusations” against Jio.

It added that COAI's earlier statements that the regulator had “copy pasted the demands of one operator” referred to Jio alone.Earlier, the telecom regulator too had dismissed as “baseless” allegations by India’s top three operators that its recent rulings and policies are biased against them and said the companies are free to move court if they find any anomaly in its orders.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/reliance-jio-again-warns-coai-rajan-mathews-of-legal-action/articleshow/63081562.cms

Only after a nod from the management committee, companies can begin developing these fields. With 60% stake, Reliance is the operator of the KGDWN-98/3, or KGD6 block. BP holds 30% and Niko 10% in the block.Three field development plans approved on Monday relate to MJ and two clusters referred to as satellite fields, according to a BP spokesperson. These three projects are expected to start producing from 2022 and will together have a peak output of around 20 million metric standard cubic meters per day, according to BP.Last June, Reliance and BP had said they planned to pump in $6 billion to produce 30-35 million cubic meters of gas a day phased over 2020-2022. The plan included development of R-series project as well as MJ and satellite fields. The field development plan for R-series has already been approved.Development of these natural gas fields discovered years ago by Reliance was delayed due to lower domestic gas prices. India follows a formula pricing for locally-produced gas, which is linked to international rates but not attractive enough for private investors to deploy their billions.After the government allowed higher prices last year for gas produced from difficult fields such as some of those in the KG Basin, Reliance and BP dusted off their previous plans and submitted investment proposals to the government. The new prices available to gas from difficult fields is more than double that of rates applicable to gas from ordinary fields.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ril-bp-get-panel-nod-for-4-billion-investment-in-kg-basin-dgh/articleshow/63086048.cms

2018-02-28,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries will likely stop producing from its MA field in the KGD6 block by October following continuous decline in output for years, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.MA is one of the three fields currently producing in RIL-BP's KG block and the only one that produces both oil and gas. D1 and D2 are the other two fields producing only gas.MA will be the first of the three fields to be shut that initially generated big expectations but began disappointing within years of starting production, creating several controversies and legal disputes on the way.Reliance, the operator of the KGD6 block, has presented the possibility of shutting the MA field by October 2018 in the annual work programme submitted to the government recently, people familiar with the matter said. The lease of floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the MA field, is coming to an end by October, they said. Reliance didn’t respond to ET’s emailed query. Reliance owns 60% in the KG block while BP owns 30% and Niko the balance 10%.The MA field began producing in September 2008 while the D1, D3 fields went onstream in April 2009. The average production from the KG block has fallen to 4.9 million metric standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) during October-December of 2017 from a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010. The peak production included 66.35 mmscmd from D1and D3 and 3.07 mmscmd from MA. The gas output from MA field peaked in January 2012 to 6.78 mmscmd. The MA field produced 2,042 barrels per day of crude oil and condensate during October-December of 2017. About 70% of the gas reserves from D1, D3 and MA fields have been recovered so far, people familiar with the matter said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-industries-may-shut-kg-blocks-ma-field/articleshow/63104934.cms

Sikka says retail investors are going ahead with SIPs as the taxation is much higher in all alternate avenues of investment like fixed deposits, gold and real estate.Edited excerpts:To begin with, SIPs in Indian mutual funds have hit the magic number of $1 billion. Can you take us through some of the trends that you have observed in the consumer behaviour on the SIP front? Are you seeing any sort of a slowdown in the recent weeks, post the news flows or disappointment with the PSU banks?We are very happy to see that the monthly SIPs have crossed $1-billion-mark and this is just the beginning! We started the year with a monthly industry SIP number of nearly Rs 4,000 crore and the year is not over yet. We are almost at Rs 6,700 crore. One of the interesting trends that we are seeing today is that most SIPs are coming in from smaller cities and towns and today SIP is becoming the first investment vehicle for a lot of Indians. There was a time a few years ago, when it was difficult to convince investors to go for SIPs but today it is becoming the first step to the capital market. Again, over the last 15-16 months, post demonetisation, the flows from small cities and towns have just been increasing. The number of systematic plans from small cities and towns beyond B15 cities is almost equal to the T15 cities. This is a trend which we could never have thought of and as Reliance Nippon Life, we have always have believed that a lot of growth in mutual funds industry will come from small cities and towns. We have been expanding a lot and demonetisation has proved to be a catalyst. SIPs are becoming a part of the monthly wallet and this will keep getting better. As far as the trends are concerned, especially over the last one month, the way we see is that the Indian investors are maturing. We have not seen any slowdown in the new SIP registration in the last one month.Also, the good thing that is happening is unlike in the past all the investors are not going through the same experience. If majority of the money is coming in a month, then markets are not doing well. Last month, markets were down 5%, investors used to panic but at this point of time, about 80,000 crore per annum is coming to systematic investment plans. These investors are not reacting too fast to market volatility.How has the response been in equity and debt flows post the budget raising the LTCG on equity mutual funds and also ULIPs being exempted from flows. I would imagine that LTCG would have put a bit of a breaks on the kind of flows we have seen?It has been four weeks since LTCG was announced. The flows for this month unofficially has not seen any slowdown. The official numbers are yet to be out. Having said that, whenever the markets are turbulent, a lot of investors including HNIs become a little jittery before they invest. But as far as retail investors are concerned, in spite of LTCG, mutual funds remain one of the most attractive products for them. If you look at the alternate avenues -- whether it has to do with fixed deposits, gold, real estate -- the taxation is much higher. So, again, the pulse that we are getting from retail investors and the distributors is there is no major slowdown in flow because of LTCG. Ultimately, we are talking of equities. When you talk of equities whether an investor is getting 18% or 20% does not matter to him as long as he is getting better than fixed deposits. So, the retail investors will not get impacted. The HNIs, however, will get impacted because of the LTCG. But vis-à-vis ULIPs, I have always believed mutual funds are far superior to ULIPs.Insurance is always there for protection but for the investments it has to be mutual funds. If you look at the high cost structure of ULIPs vis-à-vis the low-cost structure or mutual funds, there is no comparison and whether investors are getting educated or not, I do not think high- cost ULIPs can be pushed to the investors. The way I see it, clearly mutual funds have a clear edge over ULIPs.Let us talk about your company. Brokerages are very bullish on the company, post a very strong Q3 performance. You posted a 25% profit growth and a revenue growth of 25% as well, Is this kind of performance sustainable?As a company, our focus has been profitable growth. We have built up a very strong retail franchise. Right now, we are present in 269 locations. We have opened about 100 new locations after the IPO and our focus remains on small ticket size SIPs and profitability. If you were to see YTD for the nine months, effectively the profit and the revenue has grown by 26%, the PAT has grown by 27% and post demonetisation, we see a lot of money which is coming into the banking system is flowing into the mutual fund industry.With our strong brand and franchise, we are in a very strong position to capture the inflows. Just to give you the numbers, post demonetisation, roughly Rs 2 lakh crore of retail money has come into the mutual fund industry and we have got Rs 30,000 crore out of that. Against our market share of 11% post demonetisation, we have got 18% of the retail flows coming into the mutual fund industry. We clearly believe that the strong franchise that we have built up and with the operating leverage which will come into play, clearly, we should be able to sustain the growth rate.Your AUM growth has been at a 1.8% on a sequential basis and 17% year-on-year. What regions and segments are contributing to this high growth and is this number sustainable? Can you even better that going forward?I will take the second part of the question first. At this point of time, less than 2% of the population is investing in mutual funds. Clearly post demonetisation, mutual fund is coming as the best investment avenue. The money coming into the banking system has to flow somewhere; gold is not attractive, real estate is not attractive and fixed deposit rates are no more attractive. This money will flow into the capital markets and mutual fund is going to be the route which is going to be used. For us, retail remains the focus, small cities remain the focus and as you are aware, we have always been talking of India and Bharat separately. Right now, we believe the next biggest driver for the mutual fund industry will be the flows coming from Bharat, from small cities and towns where we are focussing a lot. Going forward, we believe the kind of flows that we have seen, irrespective of the fact whether markets go up by 10% or down by 10%, there is a structural change happening in India. Mutual funds are becoming the first preferred investment avenue. We believe this kind of growth will be possible. However, having said that, capital markets have cyclical nature. While the growth can be plus minus 5-10% in one year or the other, from the next five years’ perspective, we believe a growth of 20-25% is possible.Can you tell us how the margins are in equity and debt AUMs and what is the outlook going forward?Broadly for us, the net margins in equity are about 125 bps. What we charge is 225 bps, the net margin coming to the management fee is 125 bps, in equity and in debt it is about 50-60 bps, money market is about 5 bps. For us, the blended yield of the company is 63 bps and going forward, with the equity proportion increasing, if you see in the last nine months also equity as an AUM which was as a percentage of AUM has increased from 28% to 34%. We believe these kind of margins will continue and not only the margins, the volumes can multiply from here taking into account very low penetration in the mutual fund industry.What are your future organic and inorganic growth plans?We are open to acquisitions. One of the object clauses for the IPO was that we will be looking at acquisitions. As you are aware, last year we had acquired Goldman Sachs India operations. Having said that, we are very conscious of the fact because we are growing organically at a very fast pace and it is far cheaper to grow organically. We will look at acquisitions if it really adds value and comes at the right price. At this point of time, we are adding Rs 7,800 crore of equity assets per annum only through SIPs which are locked in as on date.

2018-03-05,"Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure has slapped a Rs 5,440.38-crore arbitration notice on the former promoters of Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering citing breaches of warranties and representations by them at the time of acquisition.The amount claimed by Reliance Infrastructure is more than double of the Rs 2,000 crore it paid for acquisition of Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering in 2015. This acquisition marked Ambani’s foray into the defence sector where he set ambitious targets.The arbitration will be filed pursuant to SIAC, Singapore Rules, the company said. Pipavav Defence’s founder promoters, namely, Nikhil Gandhi, Bhavesh Gandhi, SKIL Infrastructure, Greek Investments and Finance Private and SKIL Shipyard have been listed as the opposing parties.Reliance Infrastructure did not give specific details of the warranties that were breached. The company informed the bourses in India that the litigations were due to “indemnity claims for breach of warranties under the purchase agreements dated March 4, 2015 entered into between the claimant and the founder promoters for acquisition of shares of Pipavav Defence & Engineering (now named Reliance Naval and Engineering).”In 2015, Reliance Infrastructure signed a share purchase agreement with the promoter group to buy 18% stake for Rs 819 crore. Subsequently, the company made an open offer to shareholders of the company and acquired another 26% in the company for around Rs 1,200 crore.“The company has discovered that there have been serious breaches of warranties and representations made by the founder promoters. As per the share purchase agreement we are entitled to claim the loss caused, in an arbitration. The company is convinced of the breaches discovered and is therefore compelled to enforce its rights,” a source close to Reliance Infrastructure said.In August, at Reliance Infrastructure’s annual general meet, Anil Ambani had told shareholders that the acquisition of Pipavav Defence and the subsequent tie-ups with international companies make Reliance Infrastructure one of the two companies in India which are strategically positioned to participate in the government’s programme to build submarines.Post the acquisition, Reliance Infra signed an agreement with Russia’s manufacturer of Air Defence Missile Systems, Almaz-Antey, to work jointly on a range of air defence missile and radar systems for the Indian defence forces.

2018-03-06,"MUMBAI: An arbitration court has “restrained” Reliance Communications (RCom) from selling or transferring assets without its permission, and set June 9 as the date for the next hearing, dealing a blow to the Anil Ambani-owned telco’s efforts to pare debt by March end under a plan driven by its lenders.“We direct the Claimant (RCom)and its affiliates are restrained from transferring, alienating, encumbrance or disposing of any of its assets without specific permission/leave of the Arbitral Tribunal,” the court of arbitration said in an interim order dated March 5.“The respondent (Ericsson) has made an arguable case and the tribunal is of the opinion that in the event it is denied any relief, it will suffer an irretrievable injury,” said Justice Swatanter Kumar, Justice VS Sirpurkar and Justice SB Sinha — all former Supreme Court judges — in their order, a copy of which has been reviewed by ET.A spokesperson for RCom — which is trying to pare its Rs 45,000-crore debt — said the operator will soon move the high court against the order. “We are looking into the matter and will move the Hon’ble High Court to oppose this directive,” the spokesperson said. The order came in an arbitration battle being fought between Ericsson and RCom with the Swedish equipment maker trying to recover its dues worth Rs 1,012 crore.The equipment maker had said that if RCom is allowed to sell or transfer its assets, it would be turned into a shell company and Ericsson wouldn’t be able to get its money back.As things stand, the ruling stalls the company’s planned sale of most of its wireless assets including spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm for over Rs20,000 crore, which was scheduled to be completed by March end. Jio did not respond to am emailed query seeking comment.The funds thus raised would be used to repay RCom’s 35 lenders. But in case RCom can’t repay by end of March, the lenders could take the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016, especially after the central bank scrapped all debt recast schemes.China Development Bank, which accounted for 37% of RCom’s secured debt, had also previously moved NCLT to recover dues worth Rs 11,460 crore, but withdrew it following an understanding with the telco after the Jio deal. Its condition was it could review its position if the money wasn’t repaid.“If RCom has been prevented to sell assets, then they will sure file and appeal in the court which means that the deal to sell assets to Reliance Jio could be delayed,” said a senior banker, asking not to be named.Anil Kher, senior advocate representing Ericsson in this case, claimed the development was a huge victory for the company. “The tribunal has secured our (Ericsson’s) money by passing the order. We have also filed a separate claim for Rs 1,600 crore that RCom owes as of October 11, 2017 with arbitral tribunal,” said Kher. He added that the Rs 1,012 crore was due till March, 2017, which has grown to Rs1,600 crore now, necessitating a separate claim from Ericsson. Ericsson has also separately moved NCLT to recover its dues from RCom, the hearing for which is due on March 9.RCom had late December just managed to avoid the possibility of ceding control to banks under a strategic debt restructuring programme, with the proposed sale of assets to Jio. After the sale to Jio, RCom exited the debt recast process. But the latest order puts a cloud on the sale process. The latest order said that substantial part of dues claimed by Ericsson have been “unequivocally admitted” to by RCom and transfer of assets, if allowed at this stage, would “render award passed by Tribunal in favour of respondent redundant”.RCom, prior and even during proceedings, had intended to delay the process and the “respondents will not be able to enjoy the fruits of decree if passed in their favour,” the order copy added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/arbitration-court-bars-reliance-communications-from-selling-or-transferring-assets/articleshow/63179620.cms

2018-03-07,"Reliance Communications (Rcom) has moved the Bombay High Court against an arbitration order passed a day before that had ""restrained” the telco from selling or transferring its assets without its permission.""The company has filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court to protect the interest of the secured lenders,"" said the telecom company in a statement to the stock exchanges late Tuesday evening. The arbitration court's interim order which would hold till the next date of hearing on June 9 was a blow to the Anil Ambani-owned telco’s efforts to pare debt by March end under a plan driven by its lenders. Therefore the Ambani owned telco which is in the midst of selling most of its wireless assets to Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) was forced to hasten its appeal to the higher courts. The interim order came in an arbitration battle being fought between Ericsson and RCom with the Swedish equipment maker trying to recover its dues worth Rs 1,012 crore.ET learnt that on Tuesday, Ericsson too filed a caveat in the Bombay High Court to ensure that its views are heard before the court takes a call. As things stand, the arbitration court ruling stalls the company’s planned sale of most of its wireless assets including spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes to Jio for over Rs20,000 crore, which was scheduled to be completed by March end.The funds thus raised would be used to repay RCom’s 35 lenders. But in case RCom can’t repay by end of March, the lenders could take the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016, especially after the central bank scrapped all debt recasts.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-communications-moves-bombay-hc-against-arbitration-court-order-barring-sale-of-assets/articleshow/63193044.cms
2018-03-08,"MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal stayed till March 13 the sale of assets of Reliance Infratel, the tower unit of Reliance Communications, the second setback this week for the Anil Ambani-owned telco that is rushing to pare debt by half by March end.The injunction by BSV Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy of the Mumbai bench of the NCLT on Wednesday came after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius), a minority shareholder in the tower company, argued that its consent was not sought for the asset sale and, if allowed, would be an “oppression of a minority shareholder under section 397 and 398” as Reliance Infratel would become defunct.The tribunal has reserved the order for March 12.According to legal sources, the RCom subsidiary may appeal against the stay order in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The telco did not respond to ET’s queries.“Consent was not asked. My company (Reliance Infratel) was profitable. Why are all assets of my company sold and only selective assets of RCom sold? Why should I go defunct? You cannot benefit yourself while I am wiped out,” argued senior counsel Iqbal Chagla, representing HSBC Daisy Investments, which owns about 5% in Reliance Infratel.This is the second hurdle for RCom in its attempt to cut Rs 45,000 crore of debt. An arbitration tribunal in a legal battle with Swedish equipment provider Ericsson stalled RCom’s asset sale plan on Monday. RCom is on the verge of selling most of its wireless assets to Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm for about Rs 25,000 crore, although both companies haven’t officially commented on the deal figure.Alpana Ghone, senior counsel representing Reliance Infratel, said the planned transaction includes Rs 8,000 crore for its tower and fibre assets, of which Rs 5,000 crore would be for the towers and land alone. Alternative asset manager Brookfield was set to pay Rs 11,000 crore for the towers before the deal was called off following the scrapping of RCom’s merger with Aircel.The HSBC counsel demanded more details, which Anil Ambani’s counsel refused to divulge.The court proceedings revealed that Bharti Airtel was the second-highest bidder for the tower assets with an offer that was 25% lower than Jio’s.Chagla argued that it was unfair that a tower company that made a profit of Rs 1,800 crore in the year ended March 2017 should be made to give up its assets while only select portions of parent RCom and Reliance Telecom were being sold as part of the overall asset monetisation programme.He pointed out to the bench that RCom, after the monetisation, would be left with a viable, profitable, capital-light company looking into B2B areas, data enterprise, undersea cable and submarine business.“From insolvency, you (RCom) will now have a viable company. RCom stands to benefit and I am the only loser,” said the senior counsel. HSBC had invested about Rs 1,100 crore in July 2007 and has about 5% share, while the rest is owned by other firms under Anil Ambani.Reliance Infratel’s counsel countered that these were delaying tactics that would further erode the value of the telco’s assets and highlighted that the debt burden was the result of turbulence in the industry.“We are helpless since the entire telecom sector is in a bad shape. Today it is a case of survival.Blocking transactions will not help and it will reduce the value of the company,” said Ghone.RCom plans to use the funds raised to repay RCom’s 35 lenders by the end of March, failing which the lenders could take the company to the NCLT under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code.“If the sale does not happen, the joint lenders’ forum comprising of all lenders will be forced to sell the assets as distressed value. It will be sold as scrap,” said Ghone.The joint lenders forum led by State Bank of India, which decided not to convert RCom’s debt to equity pending the asset sale to Jio, also argued that if the sale was not allowed, it would affect the banks and the public.Birendra Saraf, appearing for the forum, argued that the bidding process for RCom’s assets, including the tower business, was done in a transparent way.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/another-set-back-for-anil-ambani-nclt-stays-sale-of-reliance-infratel-assets/articleshow/63211322.cms

2018-03-17,"KOLKATA: Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said the affordable JioPhone has been a runaway hit, with a massive 3 to 5 lakh Indians lapping up the lowcost 4G VoLTE phone every day to go digital.Ambani said he had “mandated” (telecom arm) Reliance Jio’s young engineers to innovate the world’s most affordable 4G LTE smartphone since as many as 500 million Indians were still using low-cost feature phones and remained excluded from the benefits of the digital revolution. Something, that led to the advent of the JioPhone.“The result has been stunning: 300,000-500,000 Indians are daily migrating to the JioPhone to access high-speed internet while their existing voice needs are completely free,” said Ambani. He was speaking at an event in London Thursday evening.The JioPhone, which was launched by Jio’s sister company, Reliance Retail, comes for a Rs 1,500 deposit, refundable after three years on return of the device. To avail themselves of the refund, subscribers need to recharge for a minimum Rs 1,500 a year, or a minimum Rs 49 a month. The phone is key to telecom new entrant Jio’s quest to increase its 160 million user base amid stiff competition from India’s top telcos such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Ambani said Jio, which has become the biggest game changer in India since its launch in September 2016, was his daughter Isha’s brainchild when she was a student at Yale University in the US. The idea of Jio, he said, “was first seeded by my daughter, Isha”, in 2011. “Isha was home for holidays and wanted to submit some coursework, and she said, Dad, internet in our house sucks,” Ambani said reminiscing on how Jio was conceived. His son, Akash, he recalled, had then captured the generation gap further by noting that while “telecom was voice in the old world, in the new world, everything was digital”, and that one could do a lot more with a digital network than just talk. Isha and Akash, Ambani said, belong to “India’s young generation that is far more creative, ambitious, and far more impatient to become best in the world”. “These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age, and India cannot be left behind,” said Ambani. The RIL chairman said Jio had created the world’s largest greenfield 4G-only LTE data network that would make “India a leader in 4G in 2019”, adding that the network is also “5G-ready”.Taking a veiled dig at rival incumbent carriers, Ambani said the combined Indian telecom industry took 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network, while Jio “took just three years to build a 4G LTE network which is much larger and far more advanced”. Jio, he said, had made high quality data available at the lowest price in the world, “at almost onetenth the prices in the US”.Within the next few years, Jio, he said, “would empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe’s population to enjoy world-class digital services in India”. With its abundance of youthful talent, India, he said “is poised to become the third largest economy by 2028, within a single decade”. Ambani said India would also be among the first to “graduate to the Internet of Everything”, especially as internet becomes accessible to all Indians.While the “internet of communication, content and commerce” existed, the coming years, he envisioned, would ring in the era of “an internet of intelligence that would power nextgen smart services, an internet of energy that would be the foundation of India’s energy security and an internet of trust that would create a framework for distributed transactions and contracts without intermediaries”.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-network-may-make-india-4g-leader-in-2019/articleshow/63337012.cms
2018-03-18,"MUMBAI: Reliance Communications has approached the Supreme Court seeking to remove a legal hurdle which threatens to stall its efforts to complete the sale of wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm and repay part of its Rs 45,000 crore debt before the end of March.RCom moved the Supreme Court last week, after the Bombay High Court dismissed its appeal against an arbitration tribunal ruling to bar the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission, people familiar with the matter. While the company faces other cases and curbs on transactions of some assets, the arbitration tribunal’s order affects the entire Rs 25,000 crore deal with Jio that is crucial for it to avoid landing in the bankruptcy court.RCom didn’t respond to an email seeking comment until press time Sunday.The petition in the Supreme Court is a last ditch effort by RCom, as the company and two of its units, Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom, race against time to complete the deal before the end of the fiscal year. It needs the money to repay 35 lenders, failing which they could take it to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code.The Anil Ambani-led telco in late December struck a deal to sell most of its spectrum, fibre, towers and switching nodes to Jio, promoted by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh.But Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson, which is claiming Rs 1,012 crore of arrears from RCom, got an arbitration tribunal order preventing the transfer of the telco’s assets till further orders. RCom approached the Bombay High Court against the tribunal’s order, but its appeal was dismissed over a week ago.RCom's stance in the case is that secured creditors, such as banks, rank above unsecured vendors like equipment supplier like Ericsson in any debt resolution plan. After the high court dismissed its appeal, the company said it would take “necessary actions in the best interest of all the stakeholders”.The telecom company is in the midst of several other legal battles that have thrown a spanner in its efforts to sell assets. It is expected to shortly appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against an NCLT stay order on the sale of its towers and optic fibre assets.The NCLT last week restrained Reliance Infratel from selling its towers and fibre to Jio for about Rs 8,000 crore till further order. That order came on a petition by HSBC Daisy Investments and some other minority shareholders — together holding just over 4% in the tower company — that their consent was not sought for the asset sale and, if allowed, it would be an “oppression of a minority shareholder under section 397 and 398” as Reliance Infratel would become defunct.RCom also faces a spate of other lawsuits on recovery of arrears. Last month, American Tower Company moved the Delhi High Court against the telco and subsidiary Reliance Telecom to get security for recovery of Rs 100.63 crore of dues. It claimed that carrier had not made payments for services provided to it from July to December last year. Last week, communications solutions provider Avaya India also moved the NCLT for recovery of Rs 7.5 crore.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/policy/reliance-communications-moves-supreme-court-for-asset-sale-relief/articleshow/63357631.cms

2018-03-20,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm has approached the telecom tribunal seeking to be impleaded in a case filed by rivals Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular against a recent predatory pricing order by the sector regulator, said lawyers aware of the matter.Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) has issued notices to Airtel and Idea to file their responses to Jio’s impleading application and the matter will heard in its next hearing on April 17, a lawyer representing one of the incumbent carriers said. The two incumbents had moved the tribunal arguing that predatory pricing rules issued by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on February 16 favoured new entrant Jio at their cost.“Reliance Jio and telecom watchdog had filed separate applications to be impleaded as parties in the appeals,” said the lawyer who requested not to be named. “Telecom watchdog’s petition was disposed of since Trai was already representing consumer interest in any case,” the person said. Reliance Jio did not comment on the development.The sector regulator had last month issued a tariff order that mandated a new formula to determine predatory pricing. It changed the definition of significant market player (SMP) and gave tariff flexibility only to operators with less than 30% of the market’s subscribers or revenue. Previous SMP parameters such as volume of traffic, including data, and switching capacity, were dropped. The regulator can levy a penalty of Rs 50 lakh per violation if a tariff is found to be predatory. Trai also barred operators from offering tariff plans to only some customers in a bid to retain them, adding that all plans must be displayed on a company’s website and made available to every user. India’s top three operators – Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular – contended the rules favoured Jio, which has 13-14% share of revenue and users. Airtel and the proposed Vodafone-Idea Cellular combine would each have over 30% revenue market share. They further said the rule of not providing offers to retain customers was against the companies’ rights to do business, and therefore cannot be implemented. Airtel and Idea filed petitions in the telecom tribunal on March 4 against implementation of the Trai order until the resolution of their pleas, and asked for penalties not to be levied for non-compliance in the interim. They did not win any immediate relief though, as the tribunal wanted to hear views of Trai, which was not a party to the case at that time. Vodafone India, meanwhile, moved the Madras High Court last week, challenging the regulator’s order and the specific clause preventing it from retaining customers by offering individual offers. It won a favourable order on Saturday, which allows the company to continue to give those offers till the matter is heard next month. Legal experts said the court’s order might give a boost to the pleas of Airtel and Idea in TDSAT.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jio-seeks-to-be-impleaded-in-case-against-trais-predatory-pricing-order/articleshow/63387656.cms

2018-03-27,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio has suggested that Rs 50,000-crore corpus under the Universal Service Obligation (USO) funds — used by the government to bridge rural-urban digital divide — should not be “wasted” on “obsolete technologies”.“USO funds, I sincerely believe, should not be wasted on obsolete technologies, it should be on progressive technologies because rural India needs it,” Jio president Mathew Oommen told ET.His comment was an apparent dig at India’s older operators who, the new telco says, still offer legacy technologies such as 2G and 3G, against Jio which has put together an all IP-based 4G LTE network, supporting VoLTE (Voice over LTE) technology. Incumbent telcos such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular offer 2G and 3G services, along with 4G, but their VoLTE offerings lag Jio by a long way in terms of coverage.Mobile phone operators currently pay 5% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) towards USOF. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is sitting on a USO kitty of Rs 48,549 crore, having disbursed only Rs 4,993 in 2017-18 and Rs 7,227 in 2016-17 towards enhancing rural infrastructure to bridge digital divide.India’s telcos though have called for a cut in the USOF levy Jio’s senior executive stressed on the need to shift towards advanced wireless technologies, and said one should deliver on the pace of innovation, in tandem with the creation of new infrastructure, and not ride on “obsolete” infrastructure by ensuring affordability and reach to all.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/rs-50k-crore-uso-funds-must-not-be-wasted-on-old-tech-reliance-jio/articleshow/63475535.cms

2018-03-27,"Talking to ET Now, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, says in OMCs, the larger part of the gain should be in the integrated plays and that is why one should put money into Reliance. Edited excerpts:Since oil has crossed the $70 per barrel mark, OMCs have seen quite a bit of movement. What is your view?The spike in the oil prices appears to be temporary. Assuming that oil remains in the steady range of around $60-$65 per barrel, the upstream companies possibly will have relatively better time compared to the downstream companies including the volatility.The upstream companies should be relatively better off but whether one should buy aggressively into the upstream company, the answer would not be an immediate yes, but Reliance would be a relatively better play because of the complete integration and the ability to process the high sulphur grade of crude which gives them an edge over the others as far as the GRM is concerned. We do not put money into the oil marketing companies and the upstream companies immediately while staying invested with Reliance as we believe the conviction level is high in that particular company.The H1 borrowing programme which got announced yesterday is bound to ease the pain in bond markets but on the other hand it is also going to benefit banks too which have been pressured on their books. Would that change the case for investment in PSU banks or it is a pocket you would still stay away from?Well certainly it is a breather and it is a very smart management of money by the government instead of borrowing money from the public markets, wWe are utilising the money from the small saving funds. From that perspective, it is a win-win combination of finance management the government is doing at the centre level. Given that situation, the bond yields are not likely to go up and in such a situation, it would be a breather for the PSBs. Their mark to market provisioning on the bond side would remain in control. Definitely, this is a positive thing along with some of the banks getting the benefits out of the NCLT divestment process which are happening currently both these things are appearing positive in the medium to long term for sure. However, I am not too sure whether in the short term there are enough reasons for buying into the PSBs. My own take is that I think the PSBs would probably struggle a bit more here and at the same time I think they are struggling to recover their money from the non-performing assets though the process has started as I mentioned. I would still think that the larger part of the PSB space would struggle for some more quarters as I see it. In immediate short-term, there are no buys on PSBs though I do agree that with the price many of the front line PSBs have become relatively more attractive compared to what they were likes of SBI but still my money would at this point of time go to some of the quality names in the NBFC today in the housing finance companies or even for that matter corporate banks even though they are slightly expensively traded given the situation, I would probably put more money into the corporate banks and the typical housing finance company.Why are oil marketing stocks falling? For a sector which was always on the losing end because of high crude prices and now on the receiving end of high prices because companies are likely to report an inventory gain. Yet, there is a lot of nervousness in some of these stocks?Being an election year, it is feared that some amount of price comfort will come and the OMCs will not be able to pass on the complete hike in the crude oil prices. That could be one of the reasons for which many of the funds are choosing to reduce their exposure into this particular space and that is the main reason we can attribute to it at this point of time. Plus of course, there is a reason to shift into some of the more attractive companies particularly in the frontline faces where the valuations are becoming very attractive for investment. Mutual funds have been shuffling their portfolios and they have been reducing the exposure into commodity driven stocks and shifting money to BFSI stocks, especially the insurance space.Finally, in OMCs, the larger part of the gain should be there in the integrated play and that is why one should put money into Reliance. What is the view on metals? Would you say the cyclical nature of the commodity is very much in place and irrespective of the volatile bouts that we have seen of late, would the uptrend in metals remain intact?The reason to remain confident about the metal cycle is largely due to the fact that India is in an expansion mode. The current level of infrastructure activities that the country is experiencing supports the metal commodity prices in this part of the world.If you look at domestic companies, you can see that they not many have added the capacities in the recent past and as a result, we believe that given the kind of consumption cycle that we are seeing, we will have higher amount of capacity eventually. Certainly, it supports the argument for the price which will remain steady to firm from current levels.Along with that, the crude oil prices are also remaining firm. So, in the metal commodity space in the global market you would find the prices remaining strong. The import duty on some of the metals which America has imposed, puts in an argument for a little higher metal prices which could possibly be beneficiary to the metal companies in the near term.It will take another 3-6 months for the industry to absorb this particular price behaviour of the commodity. So, we relatively remain confident on the metal space and companies which are in metal consumption space.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/deven-choksey-on-why-it-is-time-to-buy-into-reliance/articleshow/63476468.cms
2018-03-27,"The Delhi High Court has directed state-run Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to pay Rs 306 crore to the lenders of Reliance Infrastructure's subsidiary Delhi Airport Metro Express (DAMEPL) so that the account does not turn into a non-performing asset, the Reliance Group company said on Tuesday.The payment will be an immediate interim relief to the Reliance Infrastructure arm. Earlier this month, the court had directed DMRC to pay an arbitration award of Rs 2,950 crore to Reliance Infrastructure as compensation for violating their agreement on operating the Airport Express Line in the capital. The total amount with interest stands at Rs 5,164 crore.“The high court held that a party successful in arbitration and Section 34 cannot be allowed to become an NPA for want of enforcement of the award. The court directed that it is just and necessary that the amount sufficient to avert the declaration of the accounts of the petitioner as NPA should be paid by DMRC to the 11 banks before March 28, 2018,” Reliance Infrastructure said in a statement. In case where the accounts have already become NPA, the court has ordered that such minimum amount shall be paid by DMRC for the said accounts to be upgraded and excluded from the purview of being NPA. Reliance Infrastructure moved court to expedite the payment as four banks have already declared the loan account of DAMEPL as NPA and Allahabad Bank has recalled the entire loan of DAMEPL.DAMEPL, which had the contract to develop and operate the Airport Express Line in Delhi, won the arbitration award in May last year in the case relating to termination of the contract in 2012. The Anil Ambani-led company terminated the agreement citing that DMRC had failed to fix civil structure defects in the project. The company sought compensation and the dispute was referred to the arbitration tribunal.The tribunal, formed out of a DMRC-nominated panel as required by the concession agreement, heard the case for 3 ½ years and granted a verdict in favour of Reliance Infra.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/hc-directs-dmrc-to-pay-rs-306-crore-to-reliance-infra-arm-to-save-it-from-turning-into-npa/articleshow/63489124.cms

2018-03-28,"Reliance Mutual Fund is merging Reliance Focussed Large Cap Fund and Reliance Mid and Small Cap Fund to form Reliance Focused Equity Fund, an open-ended multicap equity scheme that will invest in maximum 30 stocks, a document from the fund house said. Reliance Focussed Large Cap Fund manages assets worth Rs 1,345 crore, and Reliance Mid and Small Cap Fund manages around Rs 3,320 crore. The move is in line with Sebi's directive on recategorisation of equity mutual fund schemes. Under the new norms, Sebi has asked fund houses to categorise their existing and new schemes under the 10 new equity categories, 16 debt and six hybrid fund categories. Many fund houses are in process of merging their schemes to comply by the new directive by Sebi. Several fund houses already changed the basic attributes of their existing schemes to comply by the new norms. Mutual fund investors are likely to see their schemes changing their basic attribute or merging with another scheme in the coming days.What should be their strategy? According to mutual fund advisors, investors should first find out the changes and act only if the change is not in line with their investment objective. For example, when a largecap scheme is merged with a mid and smallcap scheme to form a multicap scheme as in the case of Reliance, many investors would find the change clashing with their investment objective.“If a largecap scheme merges with a midcap scheme to form a multicap scheme, the investors will definitely see a change in their portfolio. If the portfolio changes, we have to get it back on track by investing in other schemes,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan, Founder, Prakala Wealth Management.Mutual fund advisors believe that merger of funds will lead to changes in the current portfolio of many investors. “An aggressive investor has to invest in a mid and smallcap scheme to reach his goal in a definite time. If the scheme becomes a largecap or a multicap, it will be problem for the investor’s plan,” says Deepali Sen, Founder, Srujan Financial Advisors.In such situations, mutual fund advisors believe that switching to another scheme is the only way out. But switching schemes may incur costs in the form of exit loads and taxation. “Generally, in such situations, the fund houses do not charge exit loads if you switch within a given time period. But we have to look at the taxation part. That can’t be ruled out,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan.Mutual fund advisors also suggest that investors should refrain from tinkering with their portfolio with half knowledge about the happenings. They suggest that investors should wait till all the fund houses are done with changing and re categorizing the schemes. “Right now only a few fund houses have made the mergers official. We should wait for all the schemes to get in the same line and then make decisions. Only after we have the full information we can think of switches and managing the changes in the portfolio better.

2018-04-05,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s fourth quarter net profit is expected to remain flat sequentially at around Rs 504 crore, on an about 3 per cent rise in revenue to Rs 7,100 crore, on the back of robust subscriptions from its continuing loyalty programme Prime, analysts said.ICICI Securities estimates Jio’s Prime membership revenue to jump as much as 80 per cent to Rs 900 crore in the March quarter from Rs 500 crore in the October-December period, although it sees the 4G newcomer’s recharge revenues dipping 3.2 per cent on-quarter and costs rising slightly.Another analyst at a leading foreign brokerage estimates Jio’s fourth quarter revenue to grow 8-9 per cent sequentially to Rs 7,500 crore.ICICI Securities, however, expects the telecom arm of Reliance Industries (RIL) to report “an 11.1 per cent sequential fall in average revenue per user (ARPU) to Rs 137 in the March quarter from Rs 154 in the October-December period”, triggered by the sharp cut in its base offer to JioPhone users at Rs 49/month and users moving to lower priced bundled plans.Analysts though expect Jio to outperform India’s older operators Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular in the January-March quarter as well. In that period, market leader Airtel is expected to post its first loss in 15 years — at about Rs 58.5 crore, according to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which expects Idea to widen its loss to Rs 1,494 crore from Rs 1,284.5 crore in the December quarter.ICICI Securities expects Jio to also steal a march over Bharti Airtel and Idea on customer-adds, estimating a 15.6 per cent sequential jump in the 4G newcomer’s subscriber base in the fourth quarter to 185 million, compared to modest 3.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent on-quarter growth estimates for Airtel and Idea Cellular, respectively. This, it said, is despite the fact that listed incumbents benefited on this score in the March quarter after fringe player Aircel filed for bankruptcy.Analysts estimate a 1.6 per cent on-quarter rise in Jio’s fourth quarter operating income at Rs 2,670 crore. But they predict a 55 basis points (bps) on-quarter dip in the telco’s Ebitda margin to 37.6 per cent.Having upended the market with its free voice and dirt cheap data rates since its launch in September 2016, Jio is expected to continue to disrupt pricing till it attains a revenue market share of around 30 per cent, compared with 15.4 per cent now, said HSBC, Further evidence of continuing competition was Jio’s move to offer its loyalty programme Prime free for existing members for another year, while offering it to new ones for a one-time fee of Rs 99.“As the market heads towards a three-player structure (amid ongoing sector consolidation), Jio’s behaviour would change once it approaches 30 per cent RMS, which may happen by end-FY19, and could be a point at which we would expect slightly less price competition in the market,” said Rajiv Sharma, HSBC director and telecom analyst.Under the circumstances, Sharma said “any pricing improvement may be 4-5 quarters away”, given that Jio’s RMS in the December quarter stood at 15.4 per cent. Analysts, however, have said Jio’s free extension of Prime subscription by a year could trigger a minimum 8-10 per cent sequential dilution in its ARPU in the first quarter of FY19.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jios-q4-net-profit-likely-to-remain-flat-q-o-q/articleshow/63622729.cms

2018-04-06,"The Supreme Court gave partial relief to Reliance Communications on Thursday, allowing it to sell most of its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm to pare its nearly Rs 45,000-crore debt. However, RCom will require separate approval for selling tower and fibre assets, from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).A two-judge bench, headed by Justice AK Goel, set aside the stay on sale of assets imposed by the Bombay High Court on March 8. Lenders got the go-ahead to sell RCom’s spectrum, real estate and switching nodes — which, till now, could not be done without prior permission of an arbitral court. However, the bench did not lift the stay imposed by a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order, on sale of towers and fibre housed under Reliance Infratel. It instead asked RCom to move NCLAT as per procedure to get the stay vacated.“Accordingly, there is now no bar in immediately completing asset sales of spectrum, MCNs and real estate and it shall be concluded expeditiously,” RCom said in a statement on Thursday.The Anil Ambani-owned company added that it will file an appeal on Friday before the NCLAT. NCLT granted the stay in favour of minority investors, including HSBC Daisy Investment, who hold just over 4% stake and had objected to the sale of Reliance Infratel’s towers and fibre. RCom said it was “confident of securing appropriate relief from the NCLAT to enable sales of tower and fibre assets to also be completed at the earliest. The claim of the minority investors (which is fully disputed by RCom) can, in any case, be a maximum of approximately Rs 200-300 crore of the sales proceeds.”It added that it is confident of achieving overall debt reduction of Rs 25,000 crore by selling spectrum, tower, fibre and switching nodes within the next few weeks. RCom’s shares rose 4.47% on the Bombay Stock Exchange to Rs 23.35 on Thursday.LITIGATION TRAILThe carrier had moved the apex court on March 19 against orders of the Bombay High Court and NCLT barring it from selling its wireless assets to Jio without prior approval. An arbitral tribunal had first passed these orders early March, on the plea of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson, which had sought to recover unpaid dues of over Rs 1,000 crore. The high court upheld these orders.NCLT had separately passed its orders on a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius), which had alleged oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.Senior advocate Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for RCom in the Supreme Court on Thursday, said the telco’s value would deteriorate to the extent that it would be unable to pay even secured lenders, if it is not allowed to sell assets.Ten banks, including SBI, argued for the right to sell RCom’s property as it was mortgaged by them, saying the arbitration tribunal cannot take away this right. Ericsson agreed with the banks’ having first right but argued against the sale of assets being a private arrangement between seller and buyer. RACE TO REDUCE DEBTFor RCom, it’s a race against time.

2018-04-06,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Infrastructure's (Rinfra) subsidiary DAMEPL today moved the Delhi High Court seeking attachment of DMRC's bank accounts for not depositing 75 per cent of the over Rs 5,164 crore arbitral award, including interest, within the time given by the court.Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), in an application, said that the high court in its March 6 order, while upholding the arbitral award in favour of the Rinfra subsidiary, had granted DMRC four weeks to deposit 75 per cent of the amount.The money was to be deposited in an escrow account maintained with the banks which had loaned money to DAMEPL for the Airport Express line project.In its application, which came for hearing before Justice Vibhu Bakhru, DAMEPL said that till date the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has only deposited Rs 306 crore.The court did not pass any order and listed the matter for hearing on April 10 after the DMRC said it has challenged the March 6 order and the appeal is expected to be heard by a larger bench on April 9.DAMEPL, in its application filed through advocate Rishi Agarwal, has sought attachment of DMRC's bank accounts to the extent of the amount it has to deposit in the escrow account.Earlier on March 23, the high court had directed DMRC to settle the immediate amounts that DAMEPL owes the banks for the Airport metro line project, so that its accounts are not termed non-performing assets (NPAs).It had directed DMRC to ascertain what is the immediate amount that DAMEPL has to pay to the 11 lending banks and to make the payment before March 28.The court said that the accounts of DAMEPL in the banks cannot be allowed to become NPAs despite having an arbitral award in its favour.The direction came on an interim plea by DAMEPL claiming it has to pay over Rs 1,882 crore to the banks to prevent its accounts with them from being categorised as NPAs.According to DAMEPL's plea, the 11 banks to whom immediate payments have to be made are -- Axis Bank, UCO Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank, Andhra Bank, Central Bank of India, Dena Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India, IIFC UK and Canara Bank London.On March 6, while dismissing DMRC's plea against the Arbitral Tribunal's May, 2017 order asking it to make payments to DAMEPL, the court had allowed a separate plea of the Rinfra subsidiary for an early payment of 75 per cent of the arbitral award in its favour.The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding at the depot, and the balance, including the project system works, were to be executed by DAMEPL.The Airport Express line was commissioned on February 23, 2011 after an investment of Rs 2,885 crore, funded by the DAMEPL's promoters' fund, banks and financial institutions.DAMEPL had said it had terminated the concession agreement as DMRC had not cured certain defects in the Airport Express line within 90 days of a notice issued by it.It had also said the agreement had come to effect from January 1, 2013 and the project was handed over to DMRC on June 30, 2013. Till the handing over of the project, DAMEPL had operated the line as a deemed agent of DMRC, it had said.The arbitration was entered into in August, 2013 after efforts to amicably resolve the issue did not yield any result.DAMEPL is a joint venture of Rinfra and a Spanish construction company -- Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles -- with a shareholding of 95 and five per cent respectively.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/reliance-subsidiary-moves-delhi-high-court-seeking-attachment-of-dmrc-accounts/articleshow/63646415.cms

Jio is a co-presenting sponsor for all eight teams playing in the tournament.After 10 years of being an associate sponsor, Vodafone is just a spot buyer this year. Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Jio did not respond to ET’s queries.With an investment of ₹20-25 crore— modest in comparison with Jio's ₹90-100 crore spending—the ‘guerilla’ technique will be needed to get attention from an expected 700 million viewers, said the people cited above, up from 450 million last year. The company is said to have modelled its plan on Pepsi’s ‘Nothing official about it’ campaign during the 1996 World Cup that was aimed at undercutting tournament sponsor Coca-Cola.Vodafone is expected to rollout its advertising campaigns along with game shows and consumer engagement programmes across cities from Saturday.

The acquisition has been planned keeping in mind the requirements of Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom arm, according to another person familiar with the matter.“Reliance would need content when data becomes big, especially as Jio keeps increasing its holding in this segment. Education is only one sector where the data play was missing from the company’s standpoint, which would be complete after the acquisition,” he said.Embibe had acquired 100Markes, an engineering and medical entrance exam training portal, in a cashplus-stock deal in 2015 for an undeclared amount.

2018-04-11,"Talking to ET Now, Sanjay Parekh, Reliance Mutual Fund, says we will see very high accelerated slippages this quarter and maybe FY19 also would get a little lower ROEs and ROAs and higher credit cost. But beyond that, they look quite promising.Edited excerpts:Having exposure to the banking sector and looking at the Reliance Banking Fund, what do you as an investment manager feel about the developments in the banking sector?There are two aspects to it. Clearly governance, ownership and risk management are extremely critical and we have seen that banks which are very strong on all three have benefitted and the rest of them certainly have their concerns. But we certainly have to see the positive side of it also. We have come a long way on this sector in terms of reforms. The banks have got the government infused capital. We can debate whether it was enough. Then you are seeing the resolution process. All the stakeholders are working in cohesion. There could be some litigation. There could be some speed breakers, but by and large, directionally you ask any of them and people are positive. The third part is reforms. First, in the steel sector, now in the power sector where the stress is higher. Things cannot change overnight but it would gradually get better. Also, credit growth is looking better and that will certainly help. The yields also have now softened, so the scare of rising yield at times causing pain on the bond portfolio has also receded. The overall macro is by and large in control, barring that fiscal deficit could get a little higher but if you take balance of payment or inflation, things are by and large under control. All these are actually very strong tailwinds for the banking sector. You have a choice today, you have private banks with less asset quality issues and there is a huge opportunity there. Then you have these large corporate banks, going through this transition and we have to see what is in the price. There are negatives. The RBI guideline will accelerate the NPA provisioning in Q4 and even in FY19. But all these mean tighter credit standards, better governance ahead and that really augurs well for the banking sector.Also, what is the discipline of borrowers? The discipline of borrowers is really going to get established. Even the corporate banks, the retail banks are really strong. The corporate banks are going through a transition. We will see Q4 being weak. We will see very high accelerated slippages this quarter and maybe FY19 also would get a little lower ROEs and ROAs and higher credit cost. But beyond that, they look quite promising.The Reliance Banking Fund has outperformed on all timelines. From 25th May 2003, it has outperformed the index with a return of 24% annualised basis. 26% weightage is with HDFC Bank, Bharat Financial is next, ICICI Bank also has a sizable position. You also have some holding in SBI. Should investors look at ICICI Bank favourably through this leadership transition or is it really wait and watch?I will guide you through the broad framework we used because we will not get into the specifics. So, the key thought was that one is a set of private banks with less asset quality pain and as the fax sheet suggests you have HDFC Bank or Bharat Finance which will be transiting to IndusInd Bank and then Kotak Bank. All three put together is almost 42%. These are banks which will gain market share. They have strong franchise. The CASA is strong. ROAs and ROEs will be very strong and they will gain market share ahead also. We believe that even if you do not take re-rating upwards, even if we get the earnings growth led appreciation, that is very good. It is about the risk rather than return in these banks. You obviously have to get the risk adjusted return right. The second piece is corporate banks where we are only into the large corporate banks -- be it private or public and the largest. There we are significantly underweight compared to our benchmark and as the fax sheet suggests, we have just two large corporate banks and there too we are underweight. Our view is that we are going through a transition. The retail piece of both of them is very strong. There are subsidiary values which are very good. All the subsidiaries are doing well. They would have higher credit cost in Q4 and FY19 also would have a higher credit cost but the valuations are really reasonable now. On adjusted book value, they are now at one time on forward basis. We think that a lot of it is in the price and we will have to see some more pain in earnings ahead but on a longer term, there is value. That is our view on these large corporate banks. Then we have select housing finance, insurance play, NBFCs which by and large are going to do well. We have seen even the bond yields coming off. So, some of these NBFCs which had a problem on a liability side, may actually not be the case.The IndusInd Bank stock is up 20x over 10 years. But if you bought into Axis Bank or ICICI Bank, you haven’t really got handsome returns. So, betting on corporate banks even though they were cheap three years ago or were cheap five years ago has not really been a great exercise. Whereas if you bought a retail facing NBFC or retail facing bank, you have pretty much hit a home run in last four-five years. Do you think that trend towards retail dominated franchise will continue?You are right. One, we are very positive on the retail focussed bank/NBFCs with less asset quality problems. We think there is a secular three-, five- and ten-year story there. We still feel that valuations are reasonable. They are not rich because for the ROAs, ROEs and sustainable growth, you take on price earnings basis. Price to adjusted book basis is reasonable. We are very clear and that is showing up in our weights which is a significant outsized weight. The second piece is the corporate banks where we are underweight in our banking portfolio. Having said that the retail piece, you cannot break a bank but if you take the retail piece of these banks with CASA of 47-48%, you are actually giving a significant negative value to the corporate piece. We feel that if you take the gross stress right now and let us say the gross stress I am talking of is NPA plus the other stress going around now.Did you juggle your portfolio when it came to the banking fund? Has HDFC Bank come off after that high weightage that you had of 26.25%? , Have you upped your weightage and ownership in ICICI Bank or an SBI or have you brought it down in the last one month or so?Without getting into specifics, we had reduced our weight in corporate banks when we got the RBI guideline and we were underweight already.We have increased our underweight in corporate banks but we believe from here onwards, they have significantly corrected and we really believe that while there could be some more bad news ahead, the recent lows that we have seen are a very attractive level to increase rate. But you need to keep in mind that certainly the Q4 could be painful. Even the first half of FY19 could be a little painful but we are very confident that these large corporate banks, I am not talking of the small PSU corporate banks but the large corporate banks, would certainly have a better FY20.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/retail-focussed-banks-nbfcs-are-secular-3-10-year-stories-sanjay-parekh-reliance-mf/articleshow/63729314.cms
2018-04-11,"Talking to ET Now, Sanjay Parekh, Reliance Mutual Fund, says we will see very high accelerated slippages this quarter and maybe FY19 also would get a little lower ROEs and ROAs and higher credit cost. But beyond that, they look quite promising.Edited excerpts:Having exposure to the banking sector and looking at the Reliance Banking Fund, what do you as an investment manager feel about the developments in the banking sector?There are two aspects to it. Clearly governance, ownership and risk management are extremely critical and we have seen that banks which are very strong on all three have benefitted and the rest of them certainly have their concerns. But we certainly have to see the positive side of it also. We have come a long way on this sector in terms of reforms. The banks have got the government infused capital. We can debate whether it was enough. Then you are seeing the resolution process. All the stakeholders are working in cohesion. There could be some litigation. There could be some speed breakers, but by and large, directionally you ask any of them and people are positive. The third part is reforms. First, in the steel sector, now in the power sector where the stress is higher. Things cannot change overnight but it would gradually get better. Also, credit growth is looking better and that will certainly help. The yields also have now softened, so the scare of rising yield at times causing pain on the bond portfolio has also receded. The overall macro is by and large in control, barring that fiscal deficit could get a little higher but if you take balance of payment or inflation, things are by and large under control. All these are actually very strong tailwinds for the banking sector. You have a choice today, you have private banks with less asset quality issues and there is a huge opportunity there. Then you have these large corporate banks, going through this transition and we have to see what is in the price. There are negatives. The RBI guideline will accelerate the NPA provisioning in Q4 and even in FY19. But all these mean tighter credit standards, better governance ahead and that really augurs well for the banking sector.Also, what is the discipline of borrowers? The discipline of borrowers is really going to get established. Even the corporate banks, the retail banks are really strong. The corporate banks are going through a transition. We will see Q4 being weak. We will see very high accelerated slippages this quarter and maybe FY19 also would get a little lower ROEs and ROAs and higher credit cost. But beyond that, they look quite promising.The Reliance Banking Fund has outperformed on all timelines. From 25th May 2003, it has outperformed the index with a return of 24% annualised basis. 26% weightage is with HDFC Bank, Bharat Financial is next, ICICI Bank also has a sizable position.

2018-04-12,"MUMBAI : Reliance Industries is set to acquire Alok Industries with majority of lenders to the bankrupt textile company voting in favour of the resolution plan given by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s company, two officials familiar with the development said.JM Financial ARC had bid, in partnership with Reliance Industries, for Alok Industries, making an all cash offer in the range of 15-20 per cent of outstanding loan, they said.“The offer is marginally higher than the liquidation value of the company and that is the reason that banks are willing to vote in favour,” one of them said.The liquidation value of the company is pegged at Rs 4,200 crore while the offer is in the range of Rs 4,500-5,000 crore, the sources said. There is no equity upside for lenders under the proposal given by JM Financial ARC and Reliance.Alok Industries has received claims of Rs 29,500 crore from lenders with State Bank of India being the lead bank. On Wednesday, the resolution professional had held a meeting of committee of creditors to vote for the resolution plan. Senior officials said most lenders have given a positive vote for the plan. The actual percentage of votes in favour and against will be known only on Thursday since the voting was on till late evening.“With the 270 days deadline three days away — on April 14 — lenders are not in a position to bargain a better deal,” said one of the officials cited earlier. Alok Industries is one of the few companies wherein the resolution professional (RP) has called for a resolution plan several times after it was admitted. In March alone, the RP invited binding bids twice. The RP had set a deadline of March 13 when it received just one bid from JM Financial ARC. However, lenders rejected it since JM Financial ARC did not disclose the name of the strategic partner. Lenders felt that the bidder has to comply with Section 29(A), which bars defaulters from bidding for resolution plan and therefore names of strategic partners have to be disclosed for them to take a decision on the bid. The second round of bidding concluded on March 27. If 75 per cent of the lenders in terms of value of loan give their consent to the plan, the RP has to submit it to the NCLT for approval.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-jm-financials-arc-to-buy-alok-industries/articleshow/63726615.cms

2018-04-12,"NEW DELHI: A laptop with a SIM card -- after smartphones and the 4G feature phone -- could be the next big bet for Reliance Jio in its bid to increase its average revenue per user (ARPU).The Mukesh Ambani-led Jio has held talks with US chip major Qualcomm to bring out laptops running the Windows 10 operating system with built-in cellular connections for the Indian market. Qualcomm is already closely working with Jio and Reliance Retail for the 4G feature phone.“…we have talked to Jio. They could take the device and bundle it with data and content,” Miguel Nunes, senior director, product management, Qualcomm Technologies, told ET.The chipmaker is also talking to home-bred Internet of Things (IoT) brand Smartron to bring the Snapdragon 835-powered laptops with cellular connectivity. Smartron confirmed the talks.Globally, Qualcomm is already working with players such as HP, Asus and Lenovo for the so-called “Always Connected PCs”. Besides, Nunes said that there are now 14 operators that have extended their support for this new category, including the US’ Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and major carriers in Germany, Italy, the UK, France, and Australia.Jio, which didn’t respond to ET’s queries, already has a device play in the country through its sister company, Reliance Retail, which sells MiFi dongles, LYF smartphones and 4G feature phone. It currently sources these devices from various Chinese original device markets (ODMs).Neil Shah, research director, devices & ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, said that cellular-connected laptops could be the next big ARPU device for operators beyond smartphones.As per Counterpoint data, close to five million laptops are sold every year in India with most of them connecting to either enterprise or home or public WiFi spots.""So if these productivity-centric devices are connected to cellular networks, it will boost the value proposition, driving growth for this segment: first, by providing ubiquitous connectivity on the go and, second, in terms of privacy and security as the cellular connectivity is highly secure compared to WiFi hotspots,"" Shah said.According to Counterpoint, if operators can connect a million laptops -- 20% of total sold in a year -- to 4G networks by end of next year, and can charge close to Rs 300 (US$5) to Rs 1000 (US$15) per month, pricing depending upon the usage or QoS for a “premium grade” data connection, this could generate close to $5 million or Rs 30 crore revenue per month, or close to Rs 360 crore per year at a minimum to more than Rs 1000 crore a year from these users.Qualcomm's Nunes said, ""We are trying to make sure that the operators understand the value. It’s new for the OEMs, new for the operators, and new for the channel.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/reliance-jio-bets-big-on-laptops-with-cellular-connections-in-talks-with-qualcomm/articleshow/63720346.cms
2018-04-13,"MUMBAI: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has tapped the yield-hungry Japanese loan market to help expand its telecom empire.The telecom company, owned by India’s richest man, raised $500 million through a syndicated Samurai loan from three Japanese banks, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Mizuho Bank, two people familiar with the matter told ET. The floating-rate loan is for a seven-year period.An email sent to Reliance Industries (RIL), the parent company of Jio, remained unanswered until the publication of this report. The Japanese banks involved in the fund-raising could not be contacted immediately.Loaded with huge cash deposits and shrinking investment options in homeland projects, high-street Japanese banks are chasing bankable debt securities in high-growth overseas markets. Indian Railway Finance Corp. and power utility NTPC were among the other large Indian companies that sought to raise funds through Samurai loans, Bloomberg reported last month.The average cost of debt, funded through Japanese banks, works out to be among the lowest in international financing markets. Hence, Samurai loans typically help reduce the borrower’s weighted average cost of capital. The Jio loan has been priced after adding 65 basis points over the Japanese yen-LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The LIBOR is a benchmark rate linked to different currencies.Jio, which raised the loan a few days ago, is seeking to diversify its borrowing base. Entering a new market for borrowing also helps get business in the long run, said one of the persons cited above. The proceeds may be used for the telecom company’s expansion.Last month, RIL’s board approved raising Rs 20,000 crore through debt in tranches. Analysts said the funds could be used to finance the capital expenditure requirements of Jio, including paying for the wireless assets of Reliance Communications bought under a deal signed late December. Also, RIL is seeking to enhance its contents library.“Our network continues to rapidly expand across the country. And in the next 12 months, Jio services will cover 99% of our country’s population,” Mukesh Ambani said last year during a speech delivered at the annual general meeting.Having invested more than Rs 2,00,000 crore and signing up about 175 million subscribers, Jio is also expanding its 4G network rapidly and aims to double its telecom-tower infrastructure to reach the entire population by this year end.Jio’s capex needs include about Rs 25,000 crore to be paid to Reliance Communications for wireless assets, including spectrum, towers, optic fibre and switching nodes.RIL’s decision to raise funds comes a few days after market leader Bhati Airtel announced its plans to borrow Rs 16,500 crore afresh to refinance existing loans and pay for spectrum.Jio spent about Rs 7,000 crore as capex in the December quarter and has said it expects capex levels to be similar in the ongoing March quarter.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-raises-500-million-in-samurai-loan-from-japanese-banks/articleshow/63741096.cms

Since 2007, the US has won defence orders from India worth $17 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.India is preparing to test an anti-ship version of the seeker sometime in October-November this year, Mishra said. A successful second test would allow it to go into production soon after.Hypersonic DevelopmentIn the next five years BrahMos Aerospace plans to develop the hypersonic BrahMos missile that can achieve speeds of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, Mishra said. The Indian-Russian joint venture is working on overcoming the technological challenges involved in achieving hypersonic speeds for the present Mach 2.8 missile.BrahMos is also working to extend the missile’s range to 800 km, he said, without giving a time frame. In March 2017, after India formally joined the international Missile Technology Control Regime, BrahMos successfully tested an extended range of 400 km for the missile.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-moves-to-reduce-its-reliance-on-russias-defence-imports/articleshow/63757492.cms
2018-04-16,"MUMBAI: Lenders to Alok Industries have rejected a revised offer by Reliance Industries-JM Financial ARC to acquire the bankrupt company, implying that the borrower may head into liquidation, banks must make 100% provisions against advances, and hundreds of employees could lose jobs.Only 70% of the lenders endorsed the revised all-cash offer of Rs 5,050 crore, which was just about Rs 100 crore higher than the previous offer, said two senior officials who did not want to be named. For a resolution plan to be accepted, at least 75% of the lenders have to vote in its favour.Reliance Industries, in partnership with J M Financial ARC, was the sole bidder for the bankrupt company that is facing claims of Rs 29,500 crore from financial creditors.This is the second time that lenders have rejected the Reliance–JM Financial ARC offer on the ground that it is very low. At first, the bidder offered Rs 4,950 crore, which was rejected by 30% of the lenders by value. Within 24 hours, Reliance-JM Financial ARC gave a revised offer and urged lenders to vote on it Friday evening.“In the second round, again 30% rejected it, implying that those who had rejected it earlier were not happy with the revised offer that increased the bid by just about Rs 100 crore,” said a senior official who did not want to be named.It appears that lenders such as IDBI Bank, Central Bank of India and Dena Bank were among those that voted against the offer, although their stands on the revised bid could not be independently verified with each bank.“The offer did not have any equity upside and was marginally above the liquidation value,” said a senior official when asked what may have prompted some lenders to vote against the resolution plan. The liquidation value of Alok Industries stands at Rs 4,200 crore. The revised offer may have implied a haircut of 83%.The 270-day deadline before which lenders have to finalise a resolution plan ended on April 14, a Saturday. Therefore, the resolution professional (RP) had decided to submit the resolution plan to the bankruptcy court on Monday, April 16, said senior officials. Now that the proposal has not been accepted, the RP is likely to propose that the company be sold as a going concern.Alok Industries is one of the few companies wherein the RP has called for a resolution plan several times after the borrower was admitted for bankruptcy. In March alone, the RP invited binding bids twice. The RP had set a deadline of March 13 when it received just one bid from JM Financial ARC.However, lenders had rejected it since JM Financial ARC did not disclose the name of its strategic partner in the documents. Lenders felt that the bidder must comply with Section 29(A), which bars defaulters from bidding on a resolution plan and, therefore, the names of strategic partners have to be disclosed for them to take a decision on a bid. The second round of bidding concluded on March 27, where JM Financial ARC disclosed that Reliance Industries was its partner in the bid.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/alok-lenders-reject-reliance-industries-jm-financial-arcs-revised-offer/articleshow/63777381.cms

2018-04-16,"MUMBAI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed till April 18 an insolvency tribunal order that allowed a Reliance Communications unit to sell its towers and fibre assets, temporarily halting the troubled telco’s attempt to pare debt, causing its shares to fall over 5%.The apex court stayed National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) interim order after hearing arguments by HSBC Daisy Investments and some other minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel, RCom’s tower unit, on how they will get hurt if the tower firm’s assets are sold to a third party.On April 18, NCLAT will hear the case on Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infratel's assets sale to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm and on allocation of proceeds.The tribunal had last week allowed State Bank of India (SBI)-led lenders to sell any of the mortgaged assets of RCom to a third party. It, however, had directed that the funds be kept in an escrow account till the final ruling, expected on Wednesday.HSBC Daisy-led minority shareholders, who have just over 4% stake in Reliance Infratel, challenged the ruling in Supreme Court, arguing that SBI-led lenders had no locus to sell Reliance Infratel assets. “They (the lenders) did not even file an appeal to NCLAT. So, how was an order passed allowing them to carry on asset sale?” a lawyer said, highlighting HSBC Daisy’s arguments.RCom shares dropped 5.38% to close at Rs 21.10 apiece on the BSE on Monday, when the benchmark indices ended up marginally positive. The company had shut its wireless operations last year.The Supreme Court decision, while stalling sale of towers and fibre housed under Reliance Infratel for a couple of days, doesn’t affect sale of RCom’s other assets such as spectrum, real estate and switching nodes, which were cleared by the top court last week.“RCom remains confident of completion of its asset monetisation programme of approx Rs 25,000 crore within the next few weeks, in the best interests of its secured lenders,” the telco said in a notice to the stock exchanges on Monday.In a bid to repay its 35 lenders, including SBI, and pare its Rs 45,000 crore debt, RCom had in December signed a pact to sell its wireless assets, including spectrum, nodes and tower and optic fibre assets, to Reliance Jio for about Rs 24,000 crore. The towers and optic fibre assets were valued at Rs 8,000 crore, with towers and land accounting for Rs 5,000 crore.But, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) stayed the sale of towers and fibre till further orders after a challenge by the minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel on grounds their consent was not sought for the asset sale. They told NCLT last month that, if allowed, the sale would be an “oppression of a minority shareholder under Sections 397 and 398” of the Companies Act, as Reliance Infratel would become defunct.RCom and its units then moved the Supreme Court to clear the sale. The apex court in turn asked the company and its units to move NCLAT as per procedure to get the stay on sale of towers and fibre vacated.The telco immediately moved NCLAT, which in turn allowed sale with the condition that the funds be kept in an escrow account till April 18.“NCLAT may determine the allocation, if any, of the sale proceeds to minority shareholders claiming an interest of approx 4% therein,” RCom said in its notice.Based on legal advice, the company believes the claim of minority investors in the tower and fibre proceeds, which is disputed by RCom, can at best be Rs 200 - 300 crore, it said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/supreme-court-stays-nclat-order-that-allowed-reliance-communication-to-sell-tower-assets/articleshow/63781818.cms

In October 2017 study, India’s market leader also rated top in both 4G and 3G speeds, and demonstrated an average LTE downloads of 9.2 Mbps and 3G downloads of 3.6 Mbps on its networks.The study revealed that the new comer Jio was still ahead of key rivals in 4G availability, beating the three— Airtel, Vodafone and Idea by at least 27% points in measurements.While Airtel demonstrates higher speed, it lags furthest behind on network coverage (66%), behind Jio (96%), Vodafone (68%) and Idea (68%), the OpenSignal said.Our testers were able to find an LTE signal on Jio's network 96.4% of the time in our latest test period, up from 95.6% in our October report, the mapping firm added.OpenSignal’s findings were based on a 736,571 devices test from a period ranging from December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.In a course of six months, the firm said that the telecom service providers have gone to great lengths to expand their 4G services reach and recorded a surge in 4G availability metric by Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India.The firm, however, said that in the coming quarters, the challenge for incumbents would be to match new player Reliance Jio’s capacity and the coverage, as they continue their acquisition spree in the Indian telecom market.The new findings also revealed that India has moved to 85% in LTE availability and joined high-performing 4G countries like Sweden, Taiwan and Australia.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/bharti-airtel-beats-reliance-jio-in-4g-speeds-opensignal/articleshow/63811277.cms

2018-04-24,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries, the country’s second-most valuable company, is being seen as the next likely candidate from India for the $100-billion market-cap club after Tata Consultancy Services.The oil and gas-to-telecom behemoth had first crossed the $100-billion market-cap mark in October 2007 when the rupee was at 39.5 to a dollar. In rupee terms, the company’s market capitalisation then stood at Rs 4.11 lakh crore.Reliance shares need to gain 11 per cent from the current levels (with the rupee at 66.48 against the dollar) for the company’s market value to revisit the $100-billion mark. Its market cap as of close on Monday stood at Rs 5.9 lakh crore, or $89.1 billion. The stock ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 935.15 on Monday.Analysts are betting that the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company could possibly re-enter the $100 billion club this year itself.“It is likely to be the second company in 2018 to hit the $100 billion market cap. If crude continues to be high, the company’s GRMs will be strong. Jio is also making inroads in the telecom business,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets & corporate affairs at IIFL.In the December quarter, the company had posted its highest ever quarterly consolidated net profit of Rs 9,423 crore, up 25.1 per cent from a year ago. The company is set to report result for the quarter ended March on Friday.“On the petchem side, Reliance Industries’ margins are at higher levels and are expected to remain high in the near to medium term. Volume growth will come as most of the capacity expansion is over,” said Sudeep Anand, analyst at IDBI Capital Market & Securities.“If the run rate of subscriber addition and data usage continue to be on uptrend, Jio’s profitability is likely to improve,” said Anand.The RIL stock last year broke free from its seven-year trend of underperformance versus the benchmark and surged 70.5 per cent, compared to the near 30 per cent gain in the Sensex during the same period.Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president at BOB Capital Markets, believes Jio’s performance will be key for RIL going ahead.“The key for them will be Jio. The telecom venture is gaining market share fast. Incremental market cap should be driven by re-rating of Jio,” said Ahuja. “At 9.5 times FY20 earnings and 12.5 times FY20 earnings, the stock is at a discount to market PE of 17 times. We see fair value of the stock at Rs 1,245,” added Ahuja.

2018-04-24,"Reliance Jio Infocomm filed a contempt petition in the Delhi High Court against Bharti Airtel, alleging that the rival’s caveat in its Indian Premier League-related advertisements was insufficient. The court will hear the matter on April 27.Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio had moved the court against Sunil Mittal-controlled rival earlier this month, contending that Airtel’s campaign suggested subscribers could live-stream the ongoing IPL cricket matches free, without mentioning that they would incur data charges. The court then directed Airtel to make some modifications to its campaign.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Jio, told the court on Tuesday that the disclaimers were not legible, not audible and/or not there at all.He urged the court to act urgently since the entire window of the campaign was limited to 51 days — the cricket tournament that started on April 7 will end on May 27.Jio, the newest telecom operator in India, had alleged earlier that the advertisements were deceptive and “aimed at enticing and luring viewers” to subscribe to Airtel’s service and give preference to the telco over other operators, including Jio.Senior counsel P Chidambaram, appearing for Airtel, said the operator had modified the advertisements and complied with the earlier order. The counsel added that the company had also filed an affidavit stating this.The Delhi High Court asked Airtel to provide the affidavit, file a reply to Jio’s contempt allegations and decided to take up the matter on April 27.An Airtel spokesperson termed Jio’s allegations as “false and frivolous” and said the court had given it time to submit a reply to the allegations. “We have already filed an affidavit of compliance in the Court on April 23, 2018. A copy of the same will be provided to Jio during the course of the day,"" the spokesperson added.Jio didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Both operators are betting big on this IPL, which is expected to attract 700 million viewers, to expand their customer base. They have rolled out advertisements and content-driven partnerships to get maximum attention, including a tie-up with Hotstar for live coverage.Until last year, IPL was streamed on digital platform Hotstar with a 5-minute lag, but this year, it is available live. Airtel and Jio have ensured that their users do not have to pay any subscription fee if they downloaded the Hotstar app.The telcos have sparred over advertisement claims before as well. Last year, Jio moved the Bombay High Court against Airtel and global broadband tester Ookla for running advertisements proclaiming Airtel to be India’s fastest network.Jio, which launched commercial operations in September 2016, has more than 177 million subscribers.

2018-04-25,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has initiated adjudication proceedings against Reliance Industries (RIL) for alleged unlawful gains in the trading of Reliance Petroleum (RPL) futures in 2007.RIL has moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) challenging the Sebi move. The appeal is likely to come up for hearing as early as this week, according to lawyers familiar with the case. An e-mail sent to a RIL spokesperson on Monday seeking details did not elicit any response. A Sebi spokesperson also did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.The adjudication proceedings will decide the quantum of penalty payable for the alleged violations. In March last year, the regulator had passed an order disgorging the unlawful gains of Rs 447 crore. The penalty, which could go up to three times the gains, to be levied based on the adjudication process and would be over and above the disgorgement amount.According to the Sebi order last year, RIL was directed to give up the “unlawfully gained” amount of Rs 447.27 crore. The market regulator had also asked the company to pay an interest of 12% per annum since November 2007and barred it from dealing in the derivatives segment for one year.The company was found to have devised an elaborate scheme involving twelve other entities and booked gains by squaring off short positions it had built up in Reliance Petroleum futures on November 29, 2007.The scheme these entities devised to achieve gains allegedly violated provisions of The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, The Securities Contract (Regulation) Act (SCRA) and the Sebi Prevention of Unfair Trade Practices Regulations.The regulator said RIL employed 12 entities to take separate position limits of open interest on its behalf, and cornered 93.63% of the November 2007 stock futures of RPL. It cannot be held to be a mere breach of position limits by the clients attracting penalty under the exchange circulars, Sebi had said.In statements issued following the Sebi order, RIL had said, ""We are legally advised that Sebi's conclusions are based on surmises, conjectures and hindsight view of the transactions and on untenable reasoning.""

He also did not revert to an ET questionnaire till the time of going to press.“There has been some mutual exchange of ideas with a few parties that we could align with -- as you may appreciate, this is an ongoing process and if we align our thoughts with a common vision, and if all stakeholders see the value in that, only then, can one proceed to discussing such possibilities,” said Rathore.He said his business has a lot of potential for both bespoke wear and retail in the menswear arena because of the DNA of the brand, which permits it to be independent from the dictates of fashion cycles. “Yes, we would be open to seeking external investment just as we have done for the Gurukul School of Design, that we have set up in Jaipur,” Rathore said.A spokesperson for Rajesh Pratap Singh confirmed being approached by Reliance Brands, but said it was a long time ago. “At this juncture, it would be important for us to look at not just a partner for investment in the business but also someone who would be a strategic fit for our growth, and more importantly, someone who understands our brand philosophy,” the spokesperson said.ET could not independently verify the other designers that were reached out to.

2018-04-26,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed Reliance Communications to pay spectrum liabilities of Rs 774 crore to the telecom department by May 2 after the Anil Ambani-owned operator moved the apex court last week seeking more time clear dues and banks agreed to shell out the amount.RCom told the court it was willing to make payment but required more time, which the telecom department opposed on the grounds that the company was delaying the instalment for spectrum that was due on April 20, said lawyers aware of the development. “RCom has been given a week’s time from today to make the payment,” one of the lawyers present in court said. The telco’s shares fell 1.4% to close at Rs 17.70 on the BSE on Wednesday. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had refused to grant an extension to the struggling carrier, which shut down its voice services last year, to pay the instalment due for spectrum auctioned in 2013 and 2015.Lenders led by State Bank of India had agreed to pay the amount for RCom so that no further litigation prevents or delays the sale of the company’s wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm. Proceeds of the sale, amounting to almost Rs 25,000 crore, will be used to pare RCom’s debt of about Rs 45,000 crore.SBI wrote to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India that it would pay on behalf of RCom and that the case should be put to rest.The DoT holds bank guarantees for all deferred spectrum charges.It has the right to forfeit spectrum or cellular licence if a payment is missed. RCom didn’t comment on the matter as of press time Wednesday.RCom has been trying to sell its wireless assets including towers, fibre, spectrum and switching nodes to Reliance Jio and wants to sell its real estate assets - a majority in the Navi Mumbai-based Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City - as well to further pare its debt to about Rs 6,000 crore.While the courts have allowed the sale of spectrum and switching nodes to Jio, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal barred the company from selling the tower and fibre assets as of now.

2018-04-26,"MUMBAI: A consortium of 30 lenders to Reliance Communications, led by State Bank of India, has urged the bankruptcy court to dismiss Ericsson’s insolvency petition against the telco, saying its Rs18,000 crore asset sale to Reliance Jio was critical to all parties.“Do not admit the matter,” Fredun De Vitre, senior counsel who represented the 30 lenders waiting to recover their dues from Reliance Communications (RCom) through asset monetisation, told the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). “The process (sale of assets) is in progress and stalling the sale will adversely affect everyone. If the sale happens, Rs 18,000 crore will come into the company (RCom) which has a debt of about Rs 40,000 crore,” he said.In a bid to speed up the asset sale, RCom’s lenders recently also agreed to pay the Rs 774 crore that the telco owes the department of telecommunications (DoT).The Supreme Court had on Wednesday asked RCom to pay DoT by May 2.Bringing this up before NCLT, Ericsson’s counsel said if the bankers did not want insolvency petition accepted then they should pay RCom’s due amount to the vendor as well.“The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Clause (IBC) petition has been pending for long and there has been no settlement from RCom till now,” senior counsel Anil Kher and Pessy Modi told NCLT on behalf of Ericsson. “They have admitted their liabilities but said we will get zero.”RCom has been fighting a legal tussle with Ericsson since last September. The telecom equipment maker alleges that the Anil Ambani-owned operator owes it Rs 1,012 crore.The bench, comprising B S V Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy, asked counsel representing the 30 lenders to file an intervention petition and adjourned the matter for hearing for May 4.Shares of RCom dropped 5.1% to close at Rs 16.80 a piece on the BSE on Thursday, when the benchmark indices ended up marginally positive. The company had shut its wireless operations last year.RCom had in December last year signed a pact to sell its towers, fibre, spectrum and switching nodes to Jio.Ericsson’s counsel alleged before NCLT that RCom’s deal with Jio was a private arrangement, which SBI’s counsel vehemently denied.“The assets are being bought by one of the largest conglomerates (Jio) in India whose bid was 25% higher than the second offer,” said De Vitre. Earlier, court proceedings revealed that Bharti Airtel was the second highest bidder for the tower assets with an offer 25% lower than Jio’s.Senior counsel Navroz Seervai represented the Anil Ambani-owned company and its units.Last month, Ericsson got an arbitration tribunal order preventing the transfer of the telco’s assets till further permission. RCom approached the Bombay High Court against the tribunal’s order, but its appeal was dismissed. The telco then moved the Supreme Court, which allowed sale of assets but not the towers till clearance from National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).RCom is in a separate legal battle with HSBC Daisy Investments and other minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel, the tower unit of RCom, who opposed the sale of towers, alleging that it will lead to oppression of minority shareholders.NCLAT will hear the case on May 2.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-led-lenders-ask-nclt-to-dismiss-ericsson-insolvency-plea-against-reliance-communications/articleshow/63931506.cms
2018-04-27,"Reliance Industries is likely to post 13th straight sequential increase in the standalone net profit when it declares results for the March quarter on Friday. Higher profitability of the petrochemical segment and stable gross refining margin will drive growth. Jio’s performance will also be crucial given aggressive tariffs and discounts since January.The standalone net profit, which mainly includes the refining and petrochemicals businesses, is expected to be Rs 8,922 crore, according to Bloomberg estimate. The net profit of the consolidated operations, which encompass the traditional segments as well as interests in media, retail, and telecom, is likely to increase by 16 per cent year-on-year to Rs 9,347 crore.A better performance by the petrochemicals segment due to full benefit of the recently commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (RoGC) plant will help in offsetting the impact of moderation in the refining business. Operating profit (EBIT) of the petrochemical segment is expected to increase 85 per cent year-on-year to Rs 6,450 crore in the March 2018 quarter. The prices of the petrochemical products such as Polyethylene, Polypropylene, PoY and PSF rose 2-12 per cent in rupee terms in the March quarter from the year ago.The oil refining business, on the other hand, may see some moderation due to softening of the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) — a gauge for regional refining margins. GRM is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products. The Singapore GRM dropped by $0.2 from the previous quarter to $7.0 per barrel in the March quarter as the realisation on petrol dropped.RIL’s GRM is expected to drop by $0.3 sequentially to $11.3 per barrel in the March quarter. The premium of RIL’s GRM over the Singapore GRM is expected to fall marginally to $4.3 per barrel in the March quarter from $4.4 in the previous quarter. The premium of the RIL’s GRM may narrow as the official selling price (OSP) of the Saudi Arabia crude oil has increased in the March quarter thereby narrowing the Brent-Dubai crude differential. This may put pressure on the realisation of complex refiners such as RIL’s. The refinery volume is expected to remain flat compared with the previous quarter. The operating profit of the refining segment may drop by 8.5 per cent to Rs 5,680 crore from the year ago.The telecom division, which turned positive at the EBIT level in the September quarter is expected to report a net profit of Rs 400-500 crore for the March quarter. The operating profit (EBIT) of Jio is likely to be similar to that in the previous quarter due to fall in ARPU.

At a market value of Rs 6.4 lakh crore, RIL is India's second most-valued firm. The telecom-to-energy giant is expected to come up with another quarter of billion-dollar profit. Investors will be looking out for key monitorables such as gross refining margin (GRM), petchem business margins, progress on the remaining core expansion plans and the update on telecom venture.Brokerages largely expect the Mukesh Ambani-led oil major to report a sequential drop in GRMs to $11-11.3 per barrel (bbl), which is likely to be better than its peers. Petrochemical segment is expected to put up a good show, while all eyes will be on whether aggressive pricing, which helped Jio add a whopping 8.74 million customers in February, are here to stay. Sharekhan expects GRM for the oil major to decline to $11.3 in the fourth quarter from $11.6 sequentially. ""It would get offset by strong performance in petrochemicals segment, which is likely to benefit from higher volumes (on account of ramp up of the recently commissioned refinery off gas cracker and petchem expansion projects).Overall, we expect earnings of RILNSE 2.58 % to increase by 5.1 per cent YoY (1.3 per cent QoQ) to Rs 8,563 crore,"" it said. Another brokerage Motilal Oswal expects Reliance to report GRM of $11.4. ""We model a premium of $4.4/barrel over benchmark GRM of $7 (up 9 per cent YoY, but down 3 per cent QoQ). The petchem segment is expected to do better due to healthy delta and strong volume growth in the segment,"" the brokerage said.

2018-04-27,"HYDERABAD: A visible culture change is taking place at India’s largest private sector company, Reliance Industries (RIL). Not only has the energy-to-education enterprise provided flexible working hours to employees, it has also extended maternity benefits, allowing women to work half-day for a few months after maternity leave. RIL, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is getting younger with average age reducing and there is no diktat on formal dressing at work either. What’s more, over the last couple of years, sporting facilities such as a cricket stadium, a football and basketball ground have come up at its Navi Mumbai campus, while the canteen there boasts of around 16 different cuisines. These facilities are being utilised by employees throughout the day, indicating that they are taking charge of their work-life balance on working days. On weekends, the campus is thrown open to the families of employees.In an exclusive interview to TOI, RIL’s HR leads — Ashwani Prashara (hydrocarbons), and Sanjay Jog (Jio) — said the culture change is about responding to the needs of young employees. Jog said, “Our campus looks like a college campus. Is it a change which is cultural? It is. The important thing is not that the facilities are present, but that they are being consumed any time of the day. A gymnasium is not being consumed only in the morning before work or after work, it is being used all day.”RIL’s disruptive entry into consumer-facing businesses like telecom (Jio) could have played a role in accelerating these changes. What is also said to be a driving factor is Gen Next leaders — Akash and Isha Ambani.Jog, however, junks the argument that it is merely the consumer businesses that are bringing about the change. “The core group for executing retail and telecom came from the hydrocarbons businesses, because they understand the DNA of the group,” he added. According to Prashara, with the whole ecosystem changing, it’s about the flexibility to change with the changing times. “People demand flexible timings and the trigger was not retail or Jio, it was the need that was there and we moved to provide flexible timings. People choose to come in at any time of the day, while sticking to core hours,” Prashara said.The $51-billion RIL still draws a significant chunk of its turnover from refining and petrochemicals, but in terms of people strength, its consumer-facing business now contributes more than 50%. The strength of the consumer-facing businesses (telecom and retail) would only increase further. Jio’s current employee strength is over 1.50 lakh. “Turnover wise, the traditional businesses are big. But you need to view a business through people actually. People-wise, retail and Jio are big,” Prashara said.The average age of employees at RIL too has come down. The average age in retail and telecom is 27-28 years, while in the non-consumer facing side it is 32. Jog said, “To me, 32 itself is a significant change. It would have been higher earlier.”Prashara said, “The opportunity canvases have increased. Newer people are coming in and there are newer areas and avenues. People are aspirational, looking at growing, and if you don’t provide them the opportunities, you can’t hold them. As an organisation, the way we have grown is by betting on our people talent and capability.”The top executives from RIL’s HR division were in Hyderabad at the SHRM Tech conference, which RIL is partnering. Reliance’s presence at SHRM was a surprise to many. The group has not spoken at length about its people processes. The stress on digital, however, is not restricted to the new-age businesses of RIL. Manufacturing is going to be tech- and AI-driven as well. “We are passionate about two things. One is digital world, and the other is people. Both these need to go hand in hand to ensure that, as we get on with these, we don’t lose either in the process. That’s where it’s becoming that much more important to start getting into tech, and we are also convinced about the fact that digital is the new life, as our chairman calls it,” Prashara said.“The context is simple. The earlier workforce that was coming in had to learn from word processing to power point to excel — which at that time were the high-end technical skills in the people world. Now, the millennials are completely up the curve. Organisations are having to catch up to cater to what they want from a needs stand point, because millennials are already far ahead of the curve and very adaptable and flexible,” Prashara said.Given the scale of RIL, the HR teams are leveraging synergies across platforms. So, while the hiring and on-boarding platform was copied by retail and Jio from what existed in the hydrocarbons business, the latter is now borrowing the learning and development platforms from retail and telecom businesses. Though numbers are not available for RIL, there has been a significant shift in the needle on gender diversity as well. At Jio, women form around 30% of the total strength. Jog said, “When you are in 6,000 talukas in India, traditionally women who did not migrate earlier do not have to do so now. The opportunity set has increased. That’s another reason why the intake is a little more, particularly of women engineers. Our presence in small towns changes the whole dynamic.”Like some of the global organisations that have shunned the bell curve, RIL is only using it as a guideline, not as a mandate. The company has also moved from a six-day work week to a five-day one. The management said that providing flexibility at work has not compromised on productivity. “You don’t need a structure to say it’s a five-day week or a six-day work week. People by choice do so,” said Jog.What drives productivity, said Prashara, is employee engagement. “If you are engaged, you will put your heart and soul into it,” he said. So when Jio was in building stage, people wanted to be part of the excitement. When they worked, it didn’t matter for how many hours in a day or days in a week. Jog said, “Same would have been the energy when Jamnagar refinery was being set up.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-industries-ushers-in-cultural-change-with-hr-moves/articleshow/63937219.cms

In sales, the company had earlier set a record of Rs 1,18,038 crore in the December quarter of 2013, data compiled from corporate database Capitaline showed. The numbers were aided by a strong performance in the petrochemical segment, which gained on higher volumes on account of a ramp-up of the recently commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (ROCG) and petchem expansion projects. The world's largest ROCG at Jamnagar with a capacity of 1.5 mmtpa, along with downstream plants and utilities, was commissioned on January 2 this year. In a statement, the company said the surge in revenue was primarily because of a volume increase with the commissioning of petrochemical projects and oil price-induced jump in realisations for refining and petrochemical products. ""The increase in consolidated revenues reflects robust growth of 134 per cent in retail business and continuing growth momentum in wireless subscriber additions for Digital Services business,"" it added.

2018-04-28,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries’ quarterly net profit rose 17.3% to Rs 9,435 crore as the conglomerate turned a new leaf, with its booming petrochemicals business delivering higher earnings than refining for the first time in a decade while the newer retail and telecom ventures grew briskly in the improved economic environment.Consolidated turnover in March quarter rose 39% to Rs 1,29,120 crore, driven by higher oil prices and production and commissioning of new petrochemicals projects. The conglomerate’s new businesses made healthy contributions to its performance. Organised retail revenue rose 134% to Rs 24,183 crore while operating profit jumped 291% to Rs 951 crore, reflecting much higher operating margins from its operations across 3,837 stores in 750 cities.Its disruptive telecom business continued to expand aggressively and reported its second consecutive quarterly profit as it lured another 26.5 million customers with tariffs that its rivals blame for their plunging performance. Reliance Jio Infocomm reported a standalone net profit of Rs 510 crore on operating revenue of Rs 7,128 crore.Consolidated net profit rose 20.6% to Rs 36,075 crore while turnover rose 30.5% to Rs 4,30,731 crore in the full fiscal year FY18, which chairman Mukesh Ambani said was a landmark year for the firm’s operations and performance including the strong foundations RIL has built in the retail and digital services.Refining margins to stay firm “The growing Indian market provides exciting opportunities to scale up these businesses and maximise long-term shareholder value in the coming years,” Ambani said.Revenue from its refining and marketing business rose 28.8% to Rs 93,519 crore as its Jamnagar refinery, the world’s largest, earned $11 from every barrel it processed. The refining margin was much higher than its global peers, but slightly lower than $11.5 it reported in the same quarter last year. The segment’s operating profit was 10.9% lower at Rs 5,607 crore, which was also due to lower crude processing because of a planned maintenance shutdown. The company said refining margins in Asia were likely to remain firm in the near term.“The volatility in the market is expected to continue in the coming quarters but we feel the GRMs (gross refining margins) still look constructive,” V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer, told reporters.Exports of refined products rose to $6.3 billion from $5.1 billion in the same quarter last fiscal year.The petrochemicals business reported an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of 87% at Rs 6,435 crore, making the operating profit higher than the refining and marketing operations’ EBIT of Rs 5,607 crore. Petrochemicals revenue rose 44% to Rs 38,113 crore.Srikanth said RIL’s investment in the petrochemicals business is complete and capacities are now fully operational.“The volumes in the fourth quarter were good and we ended the whole year with 31million tonnes output. At this level of production, we would have around 35 million tonnes in FY19,” he told reporters.He was optimistic about the business. “Petrochemicals has done well driven by higher volume and better margins; this improved in the fourth quarter and should continue in the new financial year”, he said.Sharekhan research analyst Abhijeet Bora said net profit was marginally higher than estimates. “We believe that the recent surge in oil prices would improve the economics of RIL’s petcoke gassification project, which in turn would benefit refining margins.We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating on RIL,” he said.Reliance Industries’ shares closed up 2% at Rs 994.75 on the BSE before the company announced its earnings.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-profit-rises-17-3-in-q4-petrochemicals-outshines-refining/articleshow/63946905.cms
2018-04-28,"Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s net profit rose 1.2% in the March quarter from the preceding one, its second straight quarter in the black, helped by strong user additions despite average revenue per user (ARPU) dropping due mainly to the sharp cut in its base offer to JioPhone users.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company, which has upended the market since its entry in September 2016 first with free voice and data and now much cheaper mobile Internet services, has posted a net profit of Rs 510 crore compared with Rs 504 crore in the October-December period. Revenue rose 3.6% sequentially to Rs 7,128 crore. Voice calls are still free.India’s fourth-largest telco by user base started reporting results from the three-month period ended September when it posted a loss of Rs 271 crore. This compares with the first net loss for Bharti Airtel’s India operations in nearly 15 years in the January-March period.Idea is expected to widen its fourth-quarter net loss when it reports on April 28. For the full year, Jio posted a net profit of Rs 723 crore on revenue of Rs 20,154 crore.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) amounted to Rs 6,734 crore while the ebitda margin was 33.4%. “The strong financial results of Jio in a competitive market environment demonstrates the robustness of the Jio business model and ability to offer the most value to our customers and partners,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman, Reliance Industries, Jio’s parent. “Jio has demonstrated that it can scale and sustain its strong financial performance.”FALL IN ARPU The new telecom entrant’s average revenue per user (ARPU)—a key performance parameter—fell to Rs 137.1 from Rs 154 in the third quarter. Ebitda for the quarter was Rs 2,694, up 2.5% sequentially.Jio’s performance came a few days after market leader Bharti Airtel reported a Rs 652-crore net loss for its India business, before exceptional items, hurt by cuts in international termination rates interconnection usage charges, besides the ongoing price war. Revenue fell 13% with ARPU at Rs 116, its lowest ever.Anshuman Thakur, Jio’s head of strategy and planning, told reporters that the company’s accounting was in line with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind-AS).Some analysts had said the company had been able to declare a profit in the third quarter by keeping costs low thanks to the unit-of-production method of accounting.They had also pointed out that Jio had accounted for six months of revenue in the three months to December.“Revenues are recognised as and when services are provided,” Thakur said. “The tariff plan clearly mentions that the revenues would be recognised in the last month of the first recharge cycle, and now all our current revenues are for the quarter, so when they recharge we render the service and we recognise the revenue.”The accounting method may colour perceptions, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president, markets and corporate affairs, IIFL.“But still, with ebitda positive and ARPU at Rs 137, Jio is clearly an outperformer,” he said. “Against Rs 116, which is the lowest I have seenin so many quarters, from the country's largest operator Bharti, they've got an upside of 17-18%.” He added that the just-ended quarter had been the worst as far as pricing goes, but Jio still enjoys a lead on ARPU, despite this falling on quarter.“ARPU dip was the result of the price action that happened earlier on in the quarter. It was around Rs 50 reduction in tariff plans that has been impact on ARPU, but we have been more than able to make up on it through the subscriber goal,” said Thakur.He was referring to the cut in its base offer to JioPhone users to Rs 49 from Rs 90, to attract more users to its network.The quarterly ebitda margin though contracted to 37.8% compared with 38.2% in the preceding one, on higher costs and muted revenue growth. Airtel, in comparison, had a margin of 28.4% for its India mobile services business.Network operating expenses were around Rs 1,812 crore, compared with nearly Rs 1,737 crore in the third quarter, while depreciation and amortisation costs rose to Rs 1,199 crore from Rs 1,193 crore. Total expenses rose to Rs 6,345 crore from Rs 6,109 crore.SUBSCRIBER ADDITIONJio, which added a net 26.5 million subscribers to end March with 186.6 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network that have more users, and is thus a net payer of interconnection usage charges (IUC), which were reduced by the telecom regulator by 57% from October 1. In the latest quarter, Jio paid nearly Rs 1,065.9 crore as IUC, compared with Rs 1,082 crore in the preceding one. The company had paid nearly Rs 2,140 crore in the July-September quarter.Total wireless data traffic in the quarter was 5.06 billion GB, up 14% on quarter and much higher than its more established rivals such as Bharti Airtel, which recorded around 1.5 billion GB.Average data consumption per user per month was 9.7 GB while average voice traffic was 716 minutes per user per month.Airtel, in comparison, recorded 670 minutes per user, while data usage per subscriber was 6.6 GB. Jio saw 0.25% of users moving to another network, compared with Airtel’s 2.8%.Debt stood at Rs 57,000 crore, on an equity base of over Rs 1.02 lakh crore.The company recorded capex of about Rs 14,000 crore in the March quarter, compared with Rs 7,000 crore in the third quarter.“This spurt has been because we are completing our wireless network and deliveries happened in this quarter. We will cover 99% of the population this year,” said Thakur.Jio inked a pact to buy spectrum, fibre, towers and nodes from Reliance Communications and its affiliates in an all-cash deal for Rs 18,000 crore in December, but the deal closure, expected by March end, has been delayed due to cases against the Anil Ambani-owned telco. “Yes, it has taken a bit longer because of all lawsuits,” Thakur said.“We can watch from the sidelines. Most of the other conditions precedence for closing the transactions have been made, but till such time that there is clarity on legal front, we cannot go ahead and close the transaction.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-earns-black-belt-once-again-posts-net-profit-of-rs-510-crore-in-march-quarter/articleshow/63946956.cms
2018-04-28,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Investors in Reliance Industries (RIL), India’s biggest private company by profit, will likely watch one key metric while assessing Jio’s future valuations: Its return on capital employed (RoCE).The telecom arm of the company owned by India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has been at the vanguard of a data revolution in the country, playing a leading role in the re-rating of the Reliance stock over the past couple of years. Jio’s price and capacity-driven strategy to gain revenue market share has forced a consolidation in the telecom industry, making meaningful data packs affordable to millions of Indians.In the March 2018 quarter, the average revenue per user (ARPU) of Jio was Rs 137, compared with Rs 154 in the previous quarter, while the subscriber base at the Mumbai-based company rose to 186 million from 160 million in the three months.According to estimates by Kotak Institutional Equities, Reliance Jio had an RoCE of 1.1 per cent in FY18, and it is expected to jump to 8.9 per cent in FY23, with an upward traction in ARPU visible from 2020. For now, however, ARPUs across the industry may remain subdued, declining 12 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in FY 18 and FY19.Jio’s rival Bharti Airtel has also talked about lower competitive intensity. In the post-earnings call, the Airtel management said that while the downtrend in ARPU continues, the worst may be over and the key topline metric for the industry may recover in the long term.The telecom venture of Reliance has been posting positive operating profit in the past three quarters and had a profit of Rs 723 crore in FY18. It uses the unit of production (UoP) accounting method to compute depreciation, analysts say. Not conventionally used by telecom companies, UoP requires costs to be amortised based on cumulative production over the economic life and, analysts say, is traditionally used in sectors with finite resources such as oil and gas.At Jio, depreciation will be computed on the basis of network utilisation. By contrast, other telecom companies use the straight-line method to compute depreciation. Final profit figures using the two methods would be different. Hence, the Street is looking closely at the RoCE to assess the future valuation of the telecom business.Separately, the scope for earnings surprises from the conventional business such as refining and petrochemicals is limited, with the Street already factoring in incremental growth due to the commissioning of new complex units such as the refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) and petcoke gasification.On the conventional business vertical, the petrochemical segment’s operating profit rose 87 per cent to Rs 6,435 crore due to higher volume of new paraxylene, recently commissioned ROGC plant and downstream units of PE and MEG. In the refining segment, RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) dropped to $11 per barrel from $11.6 in the December quarter due to adverse Brent-Dubai differential and lower crude throughput. The Street is pricing in GRM of $11-12 per barrel in the projected earnings for FY19 due to incremental gains from petcoke gasification unit.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-adds-lustre-to-reliance-stock/articleshow/63948177.cms
2018-04-28,"Reliance Industries clocked record profits of Rs 9,435 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, up 17 per cent, on higher margins from its petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses. This indicates that RIL makes around Rs 105 crore a day. Higher earnings from petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses helped the company offset the lower contribution from the refining and oil & gas ventures. RIL’s consolidated profit was Rs 8,046 crore a year earlier.The digital services business, run under the Jio brand, posted a net profit of Rs 510 crore in Q4FY18. This is the second time in a row the telecom unit has declared a profit. RIL had launched the telecom services in September 2016. Jio is six times more profitable than Bharti Airtel, whose consolidated profit in Q4FY18 was Rs 83 crore. The digital services business posted an operating profit of Rs 1,495 crore compared to an operational loss of Rs 32 crore. Revenues of the business stood at Rs 8,421 crore in Q4FY18, helped by a 16 per cent rise in subscribers.RIL’s consolidated revenues climbed 39 per cent to Rs 1.29 lakh crore on strong volumes from its petrochemicals business due to newly commissioned projects and higher product prices, and a134 per cent surge in its retail business. For the full financial year 2017-18, RIL, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, recorded a profit of Rs 36,075 crore, an increase of 21 per cent while revenues were up by 31 per cent to Rs 4.3 lakh crore. Operating profit expanded nearly 34 per cent to Rs 74,184 crore ($11.4 billion).“FY 2017-18 was a landmark year for Reliance where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters. Reliance has become the first Indian company to record operating profit of over $10 billion with each of our key businesses — refining, petrochemicals, retail and digital services achieving recording earnings performance,” Ambani said in a statement.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-is-now-logging-rs-100-crore-profit-a-day-on-petchem-retail/articleshow/63948326.cms

Edited excerpts:ET Now: The ARPU number for Jio is at Rs 134, which is very impressive if you compare it with Bharti. I am not sure how Reliance arrived at it given a lot of freebies being distributed with Jio plan. What’s your take?Sanjiv Bhasin: Bharti’s ARPU stood at Rs 116 this quarter. This is the lowest we have seen in last many quarters and Rs 134 is a substantial beat. Like you said there are a lot of freebies and how they are managing that is questionable but then again Rs 134 is a standout number. It shows that Jio business has turned Ebitda positive and over a period of time it will sustain given that cash infusion is there.ET Now: The valuation almost went to $100 billion, just Rs 40 shy of that. The stock has run 8% this week alone and now, 15.5% overall margins are lower than the Street's expectations. Petchem Ebitda is slightly on the lower side and refining Ebit softening. Do you think the stock could come under pressure when we open for trade on Monday?Sanjiv Bhasin: Reliance deserves to be in the $100 billion club. It may not happen next week and may happen probably by next month, but definitely it is on course.This quarter maybe slightly sluggish and there may be many reasons for that. It's not that oil has been high; there must have been inventory and other issues at work. The 15.5% margin is about 150 bps lower than what we were factoring in.

2018-04-30,"Talking to ET Now, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC, though there was a revenue rundown in for R-Jio in this quarter, it was not bad in comparison with its competitors.Edited excerpts: We were talking about RIL joining the $100 billion market cap club but do you think Rel Jio can stall those plans? Reliance will do well and R-Jio will also do well. In this quarter, there was a revenue run rate slowdown for Jio, but if you look at the other telecom incumbents -- the competitors are not in a great shape in terms of their balance sheet and the leverage.Reliance is in a very strong position and the quality of service is as good or better depending upon the circle. Against this backdrop, a company which is holding on to its market share is more important. I would see that Jio will do well and as a result Reliance as a stock will also perform well. Its other businesses like petchem are doing extremely well and the stock overall does very well from here.With the exception of ICICI Bank, private banks have started rising and PSU banks have stopped falling, given that the Reserve Bank of India is aware that the provisioning norms will have an impact on bank’s balance sheets. Is a strong trade possible in an SBI, BoB or for that matter Union Bank?Two things. You just have to step back a little bit on the loan growth for corporate banks including ICICI and Axis is close to 0% -- there is no growth. On the other hand, for the retail banks, it is 15-17% which means there has not been any accretion to their bottom line.They are loss-making companies. As far as PSU banks are concerned, RBI has stepped in and allowed them to spread the losses a little bit for the following quarters. More than anything else, that depends on two factors. One, the 12 NCLT cases resolution and second, a large amount of kitchen sinking of the NPAs in this quarter and next. All this is well-known in the marketplace. Against this backdrop, as long as the new NPL formation slows down, the stocks will do well from here because the valuations are cheap.Do you also believe that ICICI Bank is perhaps a better bet than Axis right now?Both the stocks will continue to do well because they are facing very similar situations. Both are likely to see new CEOs. In the case of Axis, new CEO search has already begun. ICICI is probably going that way. Axis has kind of put out all its NPAs in this quarter. We hope ICICI will do the same but the June quarter will continue to be of the same trend and there will be more bad results. Against this backdrop, it is a question of who is the new CEO and whether the new CEO is growth oriented or not.

2018-04-30,"The entry of online smartphone brands Xiaomi and Motorola into offline helped Mukesh Ambani’s consumer electronics and smartphone retailing business, Reliance Digital, enter the $2-billion league.According to two senior industry executives aware of the details, the business grew by 31% to reach Rs 15,100 crore, or about $2.3 billion, in the year ended March 2018 from Rs 11,480 crore in 2016-17.This performance excludes sales of Reliance Jio connections and recharges, which are done by Reliance Digital and smaller format Jio Stores that are part of the same business.While Reliance attributed the growth to “focused assortment and bringing online brands offline like Xiaomi and Moto (Motorola)” in an investor presentation of its Q4 earnings announced last Friday, industry analysts said competitive pricing and offers at par with top online marketplaces, Flipkart and Amazon, have driven sales at Reliance Digital.The company said its electronics retailing business continues to “outpace market growth across key product categories”.The business has more than 220 large format Reliance Digital stores and over 1,800 smaller format neighbourhood Jio stores, which also sell smartphones and do catalogue sales of television and appliances.With this, Reliance Digital is more than four times the size of its nearest rival, Croma chain of the Tata Group.While Croma’s financial performance for FY18 is yet to be declared, the business had clocked Rs 3,268 crore sales in 2016-17 as per latest regulatory filings to the Registrar of Companies. Reliance Digital had raced past Croma in sales in 2014-15.The earnings release and presentation did not reveal the annualised revenue break-up of the consumer electronics retailing businesEmailed queries sent to Reliance Retail on Saturday remained unanswered till Monday press time.An industry executive said Reliance Digital has been able to grow despite the return of deep online discounts in categories like smartphones and television during the last festive season and the introduction of the single levy goods and services tax (GST), which had impacted the industry.“Reliance Digital has grown not just in smartphones, but also in TVs and appliances, including its private label Reconnect. The revenue also includes the service business, which is currently small with 70 service centres but is poised to become a major driver going forward,” he said.Devangshu Dutta, CEO at Third Eyesight, a retail and consumer goods consulting company, said while margins are low in consumer electronics and smartphone segment, Reliance Retail is pushing volume sales, which would then make sense of margins in aggregate.“ For Reliance, the consumer electronics retailing business is quite strategic in pushing sales of digital devices like smartphones, connected TVs and appliances which in turn will drive Jio data consumption,” he said.Reliance Digital had become the largest contributor to Reliance Retail revenues in 2016-17, accounting for 34% of overall business by overtaking the grocery segment.

2018-04-30,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will endure more financial pain through FY19 with Reliance Jio Infocomm unlikely to slacken its pricing aggression in its bid to maximise customer acquisitions and close the gap with its rivals, analysts said.The price wars, they said, would continue as Jio is focussed on retaining and increasing its almost 187 million-strong subscriber base.“The price war will continue as (parent) Reliance Industries (RIL) is very firm about the strategy going forward on (telecom arm) Jio, which continues to be focused on customer acquisition and is open to further tariff cuts based on actions of incumbents,” BNP Paribas said in a note to clients seen by ET.Analysts at JP Morgan backed the view, saying, “Jio clearly wants to offer the most competitive tariffs and gain a higher subscriber share, and its core business cash flows are strong enough to support this strategy, especially as core project spending drops.”Jio’s future pricing strategy, according to the brokerage, could induce its financially stressed rivals to increase tariffs even though this could “effectively lead to a loss of market share.”What could be particularly worrisome for the telcos is that Jio believes “it can be profitable in the current tariff environment” and continue to invest, JP Morgan said.Last week, Jio Infocomm outclassed listed operators Airtel and Idea, reporting a 1.2% sequential growth in net profit to Rs 510 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 with higher average revenue per user and voice and data usage.Bharti Airtel shares rose 0.15% to Rs 409.55 at the close on the BSE on Monday, while Idea’s shares gained 0.36% after reporting a lower-than-expected Rs 930.6 crore net loss in the March quarter, helped by a reduction in costs and higher other income. The Reliance scrip fell 3.2% closing at Rs 963.10.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said the telecom industry is “unlikely to witness any tariff hike for the next 3-to-6 months at least” as it expects both “Jio and Bharti to focus on poaching customers” of the emerging Idea-Vodafone combined entity, which is widely expected to shed some revenue market share, post-merger.“Jio intends to keep its tariffs at a discount to peers, and we don’t see the company in a rush to raise ARPU as its primary focus remains on subscriber additions,” the US brokerage said in a note after Jio’s earnings call.For the country’s older telcos, Jio’s entry in September 2016 with its disruptive tariffs compelled them to respond, putting further pressure on their revenue and profit. This competition triggered consolidation in the sector.Brokerage Nomura International expects the pace of Jio’s subscriber additions to remain robust, given that “nearly three of every four new incremental 4G LTE phone buyers opt for Jio’s service and the pace of JioPhone additions remains strong too.”Analysts said Jio has indicated it will step up its activities around the fibre broadband and enterprise business fronts, with phased commercial rollouts likely soon.“Jio believes in the currently underserviced enterprise market, it could outplay rivals, given its strong data network,” BankAm-Merrill Lynch said.With Jio users spending close to an hour a day on average on their phones, the 4G telco sees an emerging “ad monetisation opportunity,” the US brokerage added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jio-to-inflict-more-pain-to-bharti-airtel-vodafone-india-and-idea-cellular/articleshow/63978695.cms
2018-05-02,"Sharekhan has a buy call on Reliance Industries Ltd. with a target price of Rs 1110. The current market price of Reliance Industries Ltd. is Rs 973.5 Time period given by analyst is year when Reliance Industries Ltd. price can reach defined target.  Reliance Industries Ltd., incorporated in 1973, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 610169.40 crore.Outlook – Robust margin outlook for core businesses of refining and petchem; Telecom financials to improve with growth in revenue market share: We expect RIL to benefit from higher refining margin as the economics of its petcoke gasification project would improve given the recent surge in oil price. We highlight here that every $10/bbl increase in crude oil price could add $0.4/bbl to the GRM of RIL as a result of cost savings from the petcoke gasification plant. Moreover, recently commissioned downstream projects especially Refinery Off Gas Cracker (RoGC) have stablised and expected to benefit from the likely firming-up of propylene and MEG margins. We expect improvement in the financials of the telecom business, given our assumption of growth in RJIO’s revenue market share and improvement in margins on account of operating leverage.Valuation – Maintain Buy rating with unchanged PT of Rs. 1,110: We have fine tuned our FY2019 and FY2020 earnings estimates to factor in higher subscriber base and marginally lower APRU for the telecom business. We maintain our Buy rating on RIL with unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 1,110, as we remain positive on the earnings growth momentum (expect 13% EBITDA CAGR over FY2018-FY2020E) on account of the recently commissioned RoGC project and ramp-up of petcoke gasification project along with gradual improvement in the financials of the telecom business. At the CMP, the stock is trading at 13.9x its FY2019E EPS and 13x its FY2020E EPS.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-reliance-industries-target-rs-1110-sharekhan/articleshow/63995359.cms

The current market price of Reliance Industries Ltd. is Rs 952.4.The time period given by analyst is year when Reliance Industries Ltd. price can reach defined target.  Reliance Industries Ltd., incorporated in the year 1973, is a large-cap company with a market cap of Rs 609852.63 crore. Investment rationale by HDFC Securities: RIL’s standalone numbers continued to impress, led by higher Petchem volumes and margins. Petchem production volumes were up 10% QoQ and 42% YoY to 8.8 mT owing to ROGC ramp up. EBIT/kg of sales volumes stood at Rs 17.87/kg (Rs 17/kg in 3Q, 13.2/kg in 4QFY17). EBIT margin was up 356bps YoY to 17.2%. Q4 EBITDA came in at Rs 134.25bn (+19% YoY). Higher interest cost, depreciation charges and taxes partially offset growth, and PAT stood at Rs 86.97bn (+6.7% YoY).Strong GRMs should continue, helped by a delay in the net addition to global refining capacity and strong demand growth with improving economic activity. RIL’s capex of USD 18.5bn in Refining and Chemicals is nearing completion. Some projects are already operational, and will boost EBITDA in the core business over FY17-20E. During the last five years, high capex in Telecom and Core business has dragged RIL's FCF. Rising dividend payouts are likely hereon. Jio continues to gain 4G subscriber share, making us constructive on the business.

2018-05-10,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Infratel on Thursday stressed on its desperate need to sell its towers and fibre to Reliance Jio to pare debt, saying it was in public interest. The company’s views, which were backed by lenders headed by State Bank of India, in an ongoing case between the tower arm of Reliance Communications and minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments, in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).During the day, HSBC Daisy Investments countered SBI’s stand, arguing that lenders had no locus in the matter.Justices SJ Mukhopadhaya and AIS Cheema also questioned the bank on its locus standi, and said that SBI should go for mortgaged assets to get its dues, and instead head to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code courts for their grievances as the present case was that of oppression of minority shareholders in the company.The case will be heard next on May 14, and then HSBC Daisy Investments and minority shareholders will argue their side on May 16 and 17.The bench was hearing Reliance Infratel’s appeal against a March 12 order of the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which barred it from selling its tower and fibre assets.The Anil Ambani-owned company has inked a deal with the telecom arm of elder brother Mukesh Ambani to buy its wireless assets including fibre, towers, spectrum and network nodes for about Rs 18,000 crore, which will be used to trim Reliance Communication’s debt of Rs 45,000 crore.While the Supreme Court allowed RCom to proceed with the sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes and real estate -- in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati -- a legal clearance on selling fibre and towers of the company is still hanging fire. The minority shareholders had alleged in the Supreme Court that they were being oppressed and alleged mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company.Out of 43,000 towers owned by Reliance Infratel, 32,000 towers are already leased out to Reliance Jio, the company had told NCLAT earlier this week.RCom is also battling Swedish equipment maker Ericsson, which filed a petition in the NCLT, seeking liquidation of the carrier to recover Rs 1,150 crore in owed dues. According to Ericsson, RCom had not paid it for equipment and services for two years, and instead issued only a few post-dated cheques.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/desperately-need-to-sell-towers-fibre-in-public-interest-reliance-infratel-tells-nclat/articleshow/64112266.cms

Tata Power Company Ltd., incorporated in the year 1919, is a Large Cap company (having a market cap of Rs 22125.05 Crore) operating in Power sector. Investment rationale by Reliance SecuritiesTata Power Company (TPCL) has posted consolidated (reported) Rs14.8bn net profit in 4QFY18 vs. Rs2.3bn net loss in 4QFY17 led by exceptional gains to the tune of Rs12.4bn. Its consolidated revenue rose by 14.2% YoY to Rs78.5bn vs. Rs68.8bn in 4QFY17. However, adjusted PBT declined by 31.5% YoY to Rs2.5bn from Rs3.6bn in 4QFY17 owing to lower dividend from associate companies, higher losses at Mundra Plant (CGPL) along with higher interest and depreciation cost.

Thus, we maintain our HOLD recommendation on the stock with an unrevised Target Price of Rs90.Outlook & Valuation: Looking ahead, we believe lower earnings from CGPL will continue to weigh on TPCL’s overall earnings.

Further, its core operating profit dipped by 18% YoY and 17.1% % QoQ to Rs41.9bn led by lower other income and muted growth in NII. Despite continued growth in domestic loan and sustained higher CASA base, its NII remained subdued at Rs60.2bn (+1% YoY and 5.5% QoQ). Nevertheless, the Bank managed to report PAT of Rs10.2bn (-49.6% YoY & -38.2% QoQ) on the back of one-time gain of Rs33.2bn from sale of stake in ICICI Securities via IPO and tax write-back of Rs2.2bn.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/hold-icici-bank-target-rs-325-reliance-securities/articleshow/64119066.cms
2018-05-11,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Ambuja Cements Ltd. with a target price of Rs 285. The current market price of Ambuja Cements Ltd. is Rs 220.15. Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Ambuja Cements Ltd. price can reach defined target. Ambuja Cements Ltd., incorporated in 1981, is a large-cap company with a market cap of Rs 43763.62 crore.Investment rationale by Reliance SecuritiesReported operating performance of Ambuja Cements (ACL) has slipped our estimate albeit marginally 1QCY18 led by higher-than-expected operational cost. EBITDA stood at Rs4.1bn (+12% YoY and -7% QoQ) vs. our estimate of Rs4.3bn. Operating cost/tonne surged by 5% YoY and 2% QoQ to Rs3,783 mainly led by spike in input cost (due to higher fly-ash and gypsum prices), higher freight cost (led by increase in lead distance, FOR sales and diesel prices) and power & fuel cost (owing to higher petcoke prices). EBITDA/tonne stood at Rs655 vs. Rs606 and Rs750 in 1QCY17 and 4QCY17, respectively. EBITDA margin rose by 34bps YoY (-210bps QoQ) to 14.7%. Notably, average cement realisation came in marginally above our estimates at Rs4,438/tonne mainly aided by increasing contribution from premium products. Further, we believe that clarity on royalty payment to Holcim by maintaining 1% of net sales bodes well for the stock, as there were apprehensions among the investors about the possible increase in royalty charges. Though we tone down our EBITDA estimate by 5% and 8% for CY18E and CY19E, respectively mainly to factor in higher operational cost and target multiple from 13x to 12.5x on capacity constraints, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised Target Price of Rs285 (from Rs310 earlier).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-ambuja-cements-target-rs-285-reliance-securities/articleshow/64119121.cms

2018-05-11,"MUMBAI: Union Bank of India and Vijaya Bank have classified loans to Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Naval and Engineering as non-performing as of March 31, a move triggered by the regulator’s decision in February to scrap all the restructuring schemes.This could force a bunch of banks to follow suit in the Rs 9,000 crore of loans extended to the ship builder, said bankers who did not want to be identified.“Many other banks will also classify this account as non-performing loan this quarter,” said a banker who did not want to be identified. “We are surprised why some private banks have taken a contrarian view,” said the state-run banker.CEOs of Union Bank of India and Vijaya Bank declined to comment citing client confidentiality.Some private banks have not classified the loan to Reliance Naval as bad loan, said independent research analyst Hemindra Harazi. Banks have lent more than Rs 9000 crore to RNE, which was earlier known as Reliance Defence and Engineering.Over the last several quarters the account was classified as SMA2 account in the books of most banks. SMA2 are special mention accounts where banks have not received dues for over 60 days but less than 90 days.“Union Bank and Vijaya Bank have taken the right and prudent decision to classify RNE as NPA. When RNE’s auditor has questioned the viability of the company as a going concern, other banks need to explain to their shareholders and respective regulators as to why they are classifying the account as standard asset,” said Hazari.Other banks such as State Bank of India and IDBI Bank with large exposures to Reliance Naval are yet to declare their fourth quarter results.Banks and Reliance Naval were working towards restructuring the loan but it did not work out since all banks did not agree on the terms, said the sources. If a resolution plan is not in place within 180 days from the day of default, banks will have to refer it to the bankruptcy court as per RBI norms.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/union-vijaya-banks-put-npa-tag-on-reliance-naval-loans/articleshow/64122106.cms
2018-05-12,"Financially strapped Reliance Group led by Anil Ambani has vacated its corporate headquarters, Reliance Centre, at Ballard Estate.The finance-to-defence conglomerate, which has been selling its assets to reduce debt, will now operate out of its corporate office at Santacruz.The group, with a total debt of around Rs 60,000 crore, sold its power distribution business in Mumbai to Adani Group for Rs 18,800 crore in March this year.The group’s flagship Reliance Communication has offered a 51% stake to its lenders. The company will repay the rest of its Rs 27,000 crore debt by raising Rs 17,000 crore through sale of spectrum it controls and mopping up another Rs 10,000 crore by selling off its real estate asset across the country.The group’s power generation arm, Reliance Power, is also struggling. Its market value currently stands at Rs 11,400 crore, Rs 300 crore less than the Rs 11,700 crore it raised through an IPO in 2008.A senior group executive, who did not wish to be identified, said: “For all practical purposes group’s corporate office has moved to Santacruz and the entire top management, including Anil Ambani, sits there. So, it did not make sense to maintain an office in south Mumbai.” For the past few years, the Ballard Estate Office was used only for important occasions such as board meetings and press conferences, he added.The group will continue to control around 6,000 sq ft spread across three floors at Reliance Centre. While officials refused to reveal what the group planned to do with this space, a real estate consultancy firm said it can earn Reliance up to Rs 10 lakh a month in rental.In the past decade or so, a number of corporates – including Hindustan Unilever, Merck, Siemens, and Johnson and Johnson – have moved out of south or central Mumbai to the suburbs.Built on Mumbai Port Trust land, the Reliance Centre (previously called Crescent House), was owned by ICI, a Kolkata-based company. The property came into Reliance’s possession when the then undivided Reliance Industries took over some ICI businesses in the early 1990s.Reliance Group was in a dispute with state government’s civil supplies department, which occupied some space on the third floor of the building. In January 1997 Reliance got the department to vacate the space so that repairs and renovations could be carried out. But when the rationing officers tried to reclaim their office space post-reconstruction in January 2002, they were denied entry which led to a protracted legal battle between the two. In September last year, the Supreme Court ruled in the favour of the state government.Emails and phone calls made to Reliance Infrastructure’s spokesman remained unanswered at the time of going to the press.

A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud directed listing of the matter on Friday before an appropriate bench. ""List on May 18, 2018 before an appropriate bench, as per roster,"" it said after the matter was mentioned before it by advocate K R Sasiprabhu. A division bench of the High Court on May 10 had modified its single judge's interim orders and questioned the maintainability of the suit filed by RJIO alleging that Airtel's advertisement was ""deceptive and misleading"". The single judge in his May 2 order had asked Airtel to use font of 12 pixels in print media and that too in a prominent and visible place and not at the bottom. The high court had however allowed the first interim order of April 13 to continue to operate. In the April 13 order, the single judge had asked Airtel to carry a disclaimer in bold stating that under its 'live and free access offer' only subscription to video streaming platform Hotstar would be free and data charges according to the subscriber's plan would apply. The May 2 order had said, ""So far as the video clips/television advertisements are concerned the disclaimer should start running from the word the girl says 'Seasonal Pass-------------' and it should be displayed in sync with the voice over. The disclaimer in bill boards and hoardings be also at prominent place."" During the hearing of the appeal by Airtel, the high court bench said it had ""grave doubts"" about maintainability of the suit by the RJIO. The RJIO, in its suit, had claimed that the advertisements ""falsely proclaim"" that Airtel was offering ""live and free"" access to T20 cricket coverage and also ""falsely represent that a subscriber need only obtain a 4G sim from the defendant company and download the Airtel TV app to obtain a virtual season pass, that is live and free access to T20 coverage"".",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ipl-coverage-sc-to-hear-reliance-jios-plea-against-delhi-hc-order/articleshow/64163495.cms

RIL recently completed a massive capex that upped the downstream integration, improving its business profile.RIL's GRM (gross refining margin) improved to USD 11.6 a barrel in FY18, from USD 11 a barrel in FY17, in line with strong industry-wide margins, Muralidharan said in the note.""While we expect industry-wide refining margins to moderate, we expect RIL's GRMs to remain strong, supported by benefits of its capex. It completed the first phase of a gasification project in H2 of FY18, with the balance scheduled for completion in the H1 of FY19,"" he said.But the rating agency noted that its digital services business, Jio, is still small and evolving, and faces intense competition from incumbents.

2018-05-17,"MUMBAI: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power has exited the ultra-mega power project (UMPP) that it had bagged in Tilaiya by selling it to the state-run Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam for Rs 113 crore, after the project didn’t take off and the company terminated power purchase agreements with different states.Sources told ET that the company is now planning a similar exit from its other UMPP which was to be set up at Krishnapatnam.“The company has transferred its entire holding of 1,49,900 equity shares of Rs 10 each, aggregating Rs 14,99,000 held in Jharkhand Integrated Power Limited, a special purpose vehicle created for development of Tilaiya UMPP, to Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam, the lead procurer, acting on behalf of procurers of Tilaiya UMPP,” the company informed the bourses.Reliance Power bagged the Tilaiya project, which was to run on captive mines in 2009 and had plans to commission it by 2015. The company managed to bag it amid competition with an aggressive bid of Rs 1.77 a unit and had signed power purchase agreements with 18 procurers in 10 states. But after years of delay, which the company blamed on the state government’s inability to hand over the land and inordinate delays in getting approvals, the company decided to drop the project.“Reliance Power gets Rs 113 crore, and the bank guarantees worth Rs 600 crore that were with procurers have also been released. Tilaiya UMPP is a closed chapter for the company,” a source close to the development told ET.In April 2015, Reliance Power initiated the process to exit the project and terminated agreements with the discoms, and that is when the lead procurer state Jharkhand decided to step in and acquire the project.Reliance Power was the only power utility to bag three of the government’s ambitious UMPPs—in Sasan, Krishnapatnam and Tilaiya. While all three projects were marred with challenges and delays, the company managed to complete the Sasan project.The company is believed to have approached the Andhra Pradesh government for a similar exit from the Krishnapatnam UMPP, which it had bagged in 2007. This project was to be fuelled by imported coal and with increase in coal prices, the company has said that the tariff of Rs 2.33 was unviable.Under the UMPP policy, the government identifies a project and sets up a shell company that secures land and other clearances. The shell company is then transferred to the developer who is willing to develop the project for the lowest tariff.Fuel accounts for almost 70% of the generation cost for a company. Typically, developers quote lower charges for escalation in fuel prices to make their bids more competitive and so the onus of the risk related to the fuel charges is on them.Reliance Power and Tata Power had bagged Krishnapatnam and Mundra UMPPs with bids based on imported coal from Indonesia, factoring in low to almost no escalation in prices, but the country changed its pricing policy which hurt the viability of these projects. While Tatas had already built the project, Reliance Power pulled the plug on the Krishnapatnam project during early stages.In a separate development relating to its Sasan ultra-mega power project, the company has filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the levy of tax on value of mineral-bearing land for captive coal mines allocated to the unit by the government of Madhya Pradesh, Reliance Power informed the bourses on Thursday.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-power-divests-holding-in-spv-for-tilaiya-umpp-to-juvnl-for-rs-113-crore/articleshow/64203977.cms
2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI: Several expats holding senior positions at the Mukesh Ambani-led 4G telco, Reliance Jio, have quit the company in a quick succession. Tareq Amin, Senior Vice President of Technology Development, Ayush Sharma, Senior Vice President of engineering and technology and Nikola Sucevic, Assistant Vice President and data science head have recently quit the company, people familiar with the development said.Jio’s senior vice president, Aayush Bhatnagar, is now leading Amin and Sharma’s technology-related projects for the company, another person said.A query sent to Jio didn’t elicit any response.The exits take place as Jio seeks to expand beyond mobile phone services to tap areas such as the Internet of Things, for which it has launched a pan-India network in partnership with Samsung. The telco is also offering fiber-to-home (FTTH) broadband pilot services and it will soon launch it commercially.Amin, who joined Jio in 2013, had been a prominent global face for Jio, having represented the telecom operator at various international platforms, including the Small Cell Forum.At Jio, Amin was responsible for overseeing all aspects of the technology development and automation organization, including innovation, development, and operation. He served companies like Huawei and T-Mobile in the US before joining Jio in Mumbai, India.Sharma, on the other hand, was brought on board from Silicon Valley as senior vice president of engineering and technology in January this year to drive the business around IoT and other technologies such as mobile edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence and blockchain.Sharma had joined the company after working on his own venture, MotoJeannie, in the United States, and worked for telecom gear makers Huawei and Ericsson, and Cisco in the past in the US. At Jio, Sharma was building a team of engineers to deploy and develop new technologies.Jio’s chief product and innovation officer, Rainer Deutschmann, had also left the company in September last year and is currently working as Chief Operating Officer at Dialog Axiata PLC in Sri Lanka. Caroline Seifert, Jio's chief brand, and design officer left the company in April last year after a stint of over two years.Sucevic, who served Jio for over two years, was leading data analytics development in the area of radio coverage and capacity, network modeling, telecom data mining, and other R&D projects.He has now joined Indonesia's PT Smartfren Telecom Tbk as Chief Data Scientist and Head of Analytics.

2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Reliance Communications and Ericsson are in advanced talks to settle their dispute over the telco’s dues outside the insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings, said people aware of the matter, a move that drove the carrier’s shares as much as 70% higher on Thursday.“Right now, talks are on but no formal proposal has been made,” one of the people said. Another person said, “The amount to be paid is being discussed for settlement.”Swedish equipment maker Ericsson has sought an undertaking that State Bank of India, one of RCom’s lenders, will pay up the dues if the Anil Ambani-controlled telco does not clear the settled amount, one person said.A third person said that the latest settlement amount being discussed is around Rs 700 to Rs 800 crore, after Ericsson rejected an initial offer of Rs 400-500 crore. “SBI is likely to come up with a bank guarantee of the settlement amount”.Ericsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom’s nationwide telecom network, is trying to recover over Rs 1,000 crore in dues.The talks to settle the dues came two days after the National Company Law Tribunal admitted three petitions filed by Ericsson against the telco and its subsidiaries and ordered bankruptcy proceedings against RCom. If a pact is reached, the two parties would need to approach a higher court to get the NCLT order repealed.A settlement outside the insolvency process, if allowed, may help RCom to move ahead with a plan to sell its wireless assets – spectrum, towers, fibre network and switching nodes – to Reliance Jio Infocomm for Rs 18,000 crore and pare debt of Rs 46,000 crore.The RCom stock surged as much as 70% to Rs 17.90 on the BSE on Thursday, before closing at Rs 16.55 with a 57% gain. The share price had fallen as much as 20% on Wednesday, a day after the NCLT admitted the insolvency petitions against RCom.A third person said any settlement between RCom and Ericsson could strengthen the case by HSBC Daisy Investments and other minority shareholders against RCom’s tower unit, Reliance Infratel, in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. HSBC and the others oppose the sale of Reliance Infratel’s tower and fibre assets to Jio to protect their interests.RCom declined to comment on the possible settlement of the dues. Ericsson said it doesn’t respond to market speculation. SBI did not reply to ET’s queries.Earlier Thursday though, the NCLT had rejected RCom’s plea to put off delivering the full order citing its talks with. The full order was made public later in the day, triggering insolvency proceedings against what was once India’s second largest carrier.According to the NCLT order, insolvency proceedings against RCom were to have started from May 15. The interim resolution professional, who is yet to be appointed, would have 270 days to come up with a solution to bring RCom back, failing which the company could face liquidation. RCom became only the second telco, after Aircel, to be admitted to bankruptcy proceedings.Ericsson has suggested two to three names as the interim resolution professional and is awaiting approval from the NCLT, one of the people said.The tribunal, in its order which was seen by ET, admitted Ericsson’s petitions on the grounds that the aspects of debt and default from RCom’s side were proven by the Swedish company. When the gear maker filed the petitions in April 2017, RCom owed it Rs 978.72 crore and the carrier continued to default on payments without disputing the amount or the services provided. The order states the dues to be about Rs 1,012 crore.“The petitioner (Ericsson) proved existence of debt and default… we are of the considered view that these petitions are fit for admission,” the two-member panel headed by BSV Prakash Kumar said. The bench ordered that a public announcement of the insolvency resolution process be made.“It appears that Reliance (RCom) failed to adhere to the terms and conditions entered in between Ericsson and Reliance by failing to make payment amounting to approx. Rs 1,000 crore,” it said, adding that the company would not be able to sell or transfer its assets to anyone.It added that all other legal proceedings against RCom would not move further and this includes Ericsson’s case against RCom in a separate arbitral tribunal.The order jeopardised RCom’s plan to use funds from the deal with Jio to repay a group of 28 lenders led by SBI. RCom shut its wireless operations in late 2017 after a merger attempt with Aircel fell through. It was unable to sustain operations in an intensely competitive market after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-communications-ericsson-in-talks-to-settle-dues-outside-nclt/articleshow/64212016.cms

2018-01-02,"MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) has commissioned a giant cracker project, completing its massive petchem capex programme, which Mukesh Ambani said marks a paradigm shift in the profitability of the petrochemicals business.With the commissioning of the refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) unit, the company completed its largest ever capex of around $15 billion on petrochemicals business, which could potentially double the revenue of the business.“The world’s first ROGC and downstream plants marks a paradigm shift in the profitability and sustainability of RIL’s petrochemicals business,” Chairman Ambani said in a statement.The ROGC complex uses off-gases from RIL’s two refineries at Jamnagar as input, making the raw material cost for the unit almost nominal. This will boost the profit margin and help the company compete with low-cost producers from the Middle East and North America.Analysts have pegged the commission of this unit as value accretive, with the full impact of it kicking in the next few quarters.The ROGC plant will act as a link between the refinery and petrochemical units run by the company. It will turn the off-gas from the refinery to ethylene and propylene, which will go through further value addition at the perches units to deliver high-value polymer.RIL said there are 270 ethylene plants globally with a combined capacity of over 170 million tonne per annum (mtpa). With the commissioning of this unit, RIL has a total ethylene capacity of 4 mtpa across five sites.“RIL joins the distinguished league of top petrochemical producers globally by doubling its ethylene capacity...With ROGC and imported ethane, RIL has one of the most competitive and flexible cracker portfolio,"" the company said.In the year ended 2016-17, RIL’s petchem division clocked revenue of Rs 92,472 crore with operating profit of Rs 12,990 crore. Industry watchers believe the newly commissioned petchem units could drive the revenue and profits to surpass that of its core refinery business.The company said the ROGC complex was built in record time with approximately 40% lower capital cost compared to the similar projects globally.RIL has capability to produce entire range of PE grades covering all end-uses in the Indian market.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-industries-completes-16-billion-expansiondoubles-ethylene-capacity-to-4-million-metric-tonne/articleshow/62339484.cms

2018-01-03,"MUMBAI: GIC Re has provided reinsurance support to Reliance Industries’ refinery and petrochemical plants at Jamnagar and Hazira in Gujarat. The mega risk policy of Rs 2 lakh crore is shared with 10 insurance companies, said two people familiar with the matter. Reliance Industries has paid a premium of Rs 625 crore for the cover. New India Assurance is in the lead, with the support of nine other insurance companies in the mega risk policy.The refinery has the highest asset value at a single location in the world, and is also one of the largest refining complexes, with an aggregate capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day. The policy has come into force from December 31, 2017, and about half the risk is placed in the international reinsurance market.“Such risks cannot be absorbed by any single insurance company or even a single reinsurance company and that is where such risks are shared among a number of reinsurers globally,” said a source aware of the development. GIC Re executives declined to comment.Usually, one reinsurer, known as the leader, decides the terms of such covers. Other reinsurers then adopt the terms decided by the leader and write the risk. GIC Re is also providing significant support to other large players in the oil and petroleum sector, such as ONGC, Bharat Petroleum, Mangalore Refinery, Indian Oil and Cairn Energy. This practice also applies to infrastructure, airlines, oil and energy risk, exposures and agriculture insurance, or any exposure that goes beyond the balance sheet strength of an insurer.Insurers mostly find themselves short of required financial strength to write such risks on their own.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gic-re-backs-rs-2l-crore-cover-to-reliance-industries-units/articleshow/62347445.cms

ROGC will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals.It is in advanced stage of commissioning petcoke gasification plant, which will convert coal and coke, the lowest-cost fossil fuels, into gas.CLSA said monetisation of the two plants will boost the operating income of the company but full benefits will come only in the next financial year.""Although it has indicated potential annual benefit of USD 2-2.5 billion, we model a smaller amount of USD 1.8 billion from these two projects.

2018-01-04,"Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani spoke to Devina Sengupta & Romit Guha in his first interview in 10 years. Edited excerpts:What’s your view on the 2G court ruling?Truth prevails. No individual or corporation should undergo this humiliation, slander, damage to individual and corporate reputation. Reputation that you have built over years and years can be broken in an instant.The legacy of the one-time charge came from the 2G spectrum. The Tatas thought 850 MHz was junk, so they went and surrendered their spectrum because of the one-time charge. The legacy of the one-time charge came from the 2G spectrum case. Similarly, the case filed by the COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India) against us and the Tatas on dual technology was again based on the 2G case.Will you be looking at filing for damages against the government or individuals?It is premature to talk of any action. Various people will look at their options. Telcos will look at damages caused by cancellation, which are corporate actions. Individuals will start thinking of their own. Still too many moving parts to pick any direction.So, you do not rule it out?You cannot rule out anything. What will you do, when will you, how can you do? There are so many constituents in the 2G constituency. Somebody does something, there is a collateral damage from the other side. It is complex, not simple as yes or no, it is not black and white.Did you pay the price of being rich and famous?I am neither rich, nor famous. I am just a common man.When did Reliance Communications (RCom) see the writing on the wall?In 2015-16, the telecom market was under consolidation. Competition was waning a little, the strong were becoming stronger and the weak were becoming weaker. At that time for Reliance Communications, we had that choice that shall I be consolidated or shall I be a consolidator.We had discussions with Bharti. We also had a discussion with Vodafone — those were the two big boys. We also had a discussion with the Tatas. On the ‘consolidator’ part, we had discussions with SSTL, Telenor and Aircel, whom we could effectively acquire.Why didn’t deals with Bharti Airtel or Vodafone go through? And did you talk to Jio as well?Clearly, when we looked at Bharti and Vodafone, (we) faced the challenge of the 2G controversy, which was still unresolved in the courts. Vodafone also had its arbitration issues, Tatas were going through a transition in their group leadership. So we looked at Aircel, SSTL and Telenor. Our first choice was SSTL. That deal just got consummated, so that speaks volumes about the difficulties of completing M&A transactions in India. The processes are so slow, the permissions so many, the delays are so many and the legal systems are so vast and so complex. No one can put a timeline to any deal getting done.Then came in Jio, and we did our spectrum sharing and trading deals in the 850 MHz band with them.Why did the Aircel and Brookfield deals fail?(On Aircel) clearly, there were legal challenges—there was a matter of Maxis in the 2G case in the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) court, but it had nothing to do with our deal. There was also a PIL (public interest litigation) in the Supreme Court, which gave an order that no sharing or trading deals could be done by Aircel as Mr Ananda Krishnan (the Aircel promoter) was not appearing before the court.Also, our discussions with lenders and the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) made it absolutely clear that unless the SC (Supreme Court) matter is resolved, the DoT will not give its final approval to the merger with Aircel. We tried for six months, but after that, what doesn’t work doesn’t work.Was Jio the single most important factor in forcing you to close down wireless?In the run-up to the proposed merger with Aircel was the launch of Jio. So, for 10 years, 40 quarters, RCom showed EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth, revenue growth, declared dividend, and then landscape changed in Indian telecom sector. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India), in April, also cautioned banks, disallowed new funding and brought in higher provisioning. Those were cascading effects. As I mentioned at my AGM (annual general meeting) in September, I called it creative destruction.We looked at opportunity in adversity. This was a learning from my father. November 1, we put the entire monetisation programme to work.We basically decided to exit mobility, because that was the cash burn. Other businesses were doing well, with 50-60% EBIDTA, an annuity nature and long-term contracts. With marquee companies like Facebook, Yahoo!, Amazon and Alibaba coming to India and buying space in data centres, there’s a huge growth opportunity and this trend is to continue.Please share some specifics of your recent asset sale deal with Reliance Jio? What does CDB (China Development Bank, a lender) get?As you are aware, the evaluation of all the bids, as part of RCom’s asset monetisation plan, was carried out by the oversight committee put in place for this exercise. Jio emerged as the highest bidder after a competitive and transparent bidding process, for assets such as spectrum, towers, optic fiber and related infrastructure. All proceeds from this sale will be solely used for pre-payment and repayment of debt.""You had initially planned to sell your enterprise business, but that’s now not part of the assets that have been sold. Why? Did the bids come in lower than your expectations?The new RCom is a strong company focussed on global and enterprise business. We will have a strong strategic partner coming in in the next few months.You faced headwinds in the process of tying up the asset sale deal. Why did CDB move the insolvency court against you?It is a humongous task to work with 38 banks, rating agencies. We were engaged with Chinese lenders — by far the largest lender to the group. Their exposure is multifold compared to that of SBI (State Bank of India). So, they (CDB) made a request to pay them around Rs 200 crore of interest as part of resolution so that their provisioning is taken care of. We went to the banks and asked them to give us an NoC (no-objection certificate) to pay <Rupee>200 crore, which we would arrange ourselves. Indian lenders strongly opposed… They are an invitee to the JLF (joint lenders’ forum), as being a foreign bank, they cannot be members. So CDB went to NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) to protect their interests. As a secured creditor, it is a matter of one or two hearings and it is bound to get admitted.Why did the JLF accept the latest proposal and not the first two?We had CDB in NCLT and Indian banks and lenders simply said no on all issues. We told the banks—you have a choice of CDB taking you to bankruptcy, you have a choice of Indian banks supporting CDB and the company goes into bankruptcy. And the choice that the company files for bankruptcy on its own, as it has a full plan for resolution. (We) told the Chinese that the solution is there and let us go to court and ask for adjournment. If you see on January 5 that there is progress, you take a few weeks more of adjournment.I said at the end of the meeting: “When you have money, more money comes. When you have no money, no money comes.”What is your takeaway?I am guided by moral financing. I morally owe you money—this is not a grant, this is not a gift, this is not charity… The Dhirubhai Ambani legacy is protected—we have kept our word and our moral commitment, which is most important.Was 2017 the toughest year for Reliance Group?It has been a remarkable learning—year 2017. Getting rid of the clouds and of 2G, where I had to personally go to the CBI, face interrogation, go to the trial court as a witness for the prosecution, had to drag my wife Tina to the court. Never ever again do I want to experience such issues.In 2017, we were strangulated from all sides, and with the banking system saying do not expect any resolutions or approvals (for other group companies) till the RCom issue is resolved. So, while we talk of separate corporate ratings and separate entities, as far as lenders are concerned, you are one.We had enough stress in this period. There are just a handful of people who stood by me. People would not return calls, not want to engage, not want to be seen with me. You have to go through all of that. At times like these, you get a good feel and flavour of who is actually with you, who is standing by you or not standing by you, and who is making false excuses.If I went to my father with this and told him, he would have looked at me and said: “Why are you surprised? This is called tempering of steel. A steel rod goes into the fire and out, and in again and out again many times, and that makes it stronger. This is going to make you stronger.” We have emerged stronger.We did the Reliance Nippon IPO, a huge success. So, we were clear that brand equity of Reliance is very strong and will continue to strengthen and what we have achieved with RCom will further go to strengthen our equity.I think the whole concept of flagship is irrelevant. Each corporate entity is valuable by itself.How big a hit has brand Reliance taken?After 3G auctions, we needed Rs 10,000 crore, so we went to meet the head of CDB. A 65-year-old gentleman asked me about my father, read through the book on him written by my mother, asked me about my mother. Then asked how much money do I need. I said $1.3 billion. Asked for what it was. I said it was to participate in the spectrum auctions and to pay the government and to support exports from China. It was Monday and I had the money by Friday. He said, “I was trying to understand what you stand for, what is your value system, whether I can trust you and rely on you. And I am convinced, I can trust you and rely on you.”Sir, that is why the company is called Reliance. It saddens me to say this. All of us in the corporate sector, all of us so-called leaders, we have far, far more respect outside India than we have in India. And that saddens me, that our own country doesn’t value our own leaders.How badly did the issues related to RCom impact your other businesses such as infrastructure and power? What is the group debt?You will have a halo or a shadow around you at different times. If there is light, there will also be shadow on another side. Banks told me: “You will first need to resolve RCom.”Is that phase over?Yes. We are already seeing our proposals with various banks now moving ahead. The sharp rise in stock prices of our various listed companies, which had been beaten down for no fault of their own, also tells its own story.RCom in effect has shrunk. What does the future hold?New RCom will be stronger and be India's largest B2B business. It is capex light and we are very conservatively structured. If the revenue size is much smaller than the mobile market, then so it be. IDC (international data centres) business is set to explode. There is huge opportunity and as opportunity for India grows with $400 billion in reserves and good ratings, we will grow as well.I told DoT that I am not quitting telecom, I am exiting the mobile business. We are in cloud, IoT (internet of things), data centre, submarine cables.What according to you is the future of the mobile business?From a consumer perspective, in 2018-2019, consumer choice will shrink. We blame DoT, government, corporate rivalries. But there should be introspection. If we do not see something coming at us, we should not blame others.We saw the tsunami coming against us way back 2015-16 and started the process of consolidation. But today, as I see the future of mobile business, whatever size the industry structure may be, this sector is a cash guzzler. Our projections are that this sector will spend $100 billion over five years to keep up with technology and changing demands of the consumer.The industry has Rs 9 lakh crore of debt — Rs 2 lakh crore of foreign debt, Rs 2 lakh crore of bank guarantee and Rs 5 lakh crore worth of rupee debt. I wish people in the mobile business all the very best because the times are going to be very tough.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/i-am-neither-rich-nor-famous-i-am-just-a-common-man-anil-ambani-chairman-reliance-group/articleshow/62359599.cms

2018-01-04,"By Denise WeeThings are looking up for investors in billionaire Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. after the Indian phone company staved off insolvency by agreeing to sell assets to the chairman’s brother. But lenders still face a potential hit on their earnings.That’s the view of some observers including Pavitra Sudhindran, credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., who warns that provisions connected with nonperforming loans could sting. “That could hurt their earnings, though we don’t know the extent of the provisions they have already made and are yet to make,” she said.Such a development would underscore the challenges creditors to Ambani’s company still face, even after his brother Mukesh, India’s richest man, agreed last week to buy spectrum, mobile phone towers and fiber assets.The firm, which defaulted on its dollar bonds in November, said last week that there would be “zero loan write-offs” for lenders and bondholders. But creditors face several uncertainties, including the exact valuation of the deal with Mukesh, the timeframe over which the proceeds would be received, and how the proceeds would be divided among various creditors, according to a Nomura research note on Tuesday.A Reliance Communications spokesman was unable to immediately comment.Reliance Communications debt totaled almost $7 billion as of the end of the fiscal year ended March. Debts were nine times earnings, or the second-highest ratio among Asian phone companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The banking sector will have to make additional provisions of at least 10 per cent of their exposure to Reliance Communications for the quarter ended December if it is classified as a nonperforming asset, according to the central bank’s asset classification rules.“The Indian banking industry is going to see a spike in corporate NPAs and credit costs on account of this single company in the quarter ended December 2017,” according to a note published last week by analyst Hemindra Hazari on Smartkarma research platform.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-communications-lenders-seen-facing-earnings-hit/articleshow/62364248.cms
2018-01-05,"MUMBAI: China Development Bank (CBD) plans to withdraw its insolvency filing against Reliance Communications (RCom), leaving Swedish equipment maker Ericsson the sole foreign company battling to recover dues from the Anil Ambanicontrolled telco. The hearing in the case is slated for Friday in the National Company Law Tribunal.“CDB has already received some payment and is happy with the deal it is being offered,” said a person familiar with the matter. The Chinese bank, RCom’s largest lender, will still have the right to refile this application if the final settlement is delayed, the person said.It is unlikely that operational creditors — vendors with outstanding payments — and unsecured lenders will receive significant payments, if any at all, another person close to the developments said.Ericsson, an operational creditor, is aiming to recover Rs 1,150 crore from RCom, while CDB, a secured lender accounting for 37% of RCom’s total secured debt, has dues worth Rs 11,460 crore.“Yes, we will continue with the insolvency petition,” Ericsson said in an emailed response to ET’s query. RCom and CDB did not respond to ET’s queries on the matter. RCom is trying to find solutions to the problems of unsecured lenders and operational creditors, Ambani said at a media briefing late December.Ericsson told the courts earlier that RCom had not paid it dues for two years and only a few post-dated cheques were given. In September last year, it filed for insolvency in the NCLT to recover the dues from the operator for services and equipment supplied. Negotiations for an out-of-court settlement have failed.CDB moved the NCLT in November against both RCom and its subsidiary Reliance Telecom for its dues.But RCom Chairman Ambani said that the telco had reached an out-ofcourt settlement with Chinese lenders, without disclosing details.ET had reported that CDB and other Chinese lenders were in advanced talks to take up 70% in the development of Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City (DAKC).In an interview to ET, Ambani had said that all lenders were on board RCom’s plans to repay a chunk of itsRs 45,000 crore debt by March. The plan envisages selling its wireless assets, including spectrum, towers and fibre, for under Rs 24,000 crore to Reliance Jio, monetising its real estate assets in DAKC to generate Rs 10,000 crore, and divesting stake worth Rs 4,000 crore in the residual RCom, which consists of the global undersea cable business, data centres and enterprise business, to overseas private equity investors.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/china-development-bank-plans-to-withdraw-plea-against-reliance-communication/articleshow/62375940.cms

The Chinese lender, however, warned that it retained the right to file an application again if it does not recover its dues from the telco, which is in the midst of strategic debt restructuring (SDR). While Khambatta didn’t spell out the specifics of any out-of-court settlement with RCom, ET had earlier reported CDB and other Chinese lenders were in advanced talks to take up 70% in the development of Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City. Arguing for Ericsson, Khambatta told the bench comprising Justices BSV Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy that RCom “has miserably failed to make payments” and listed out the multiple exchanges between Ericsson with RCom and its affiliates on dues for its services according to the contractual agreements signed in May 2012. The court will hear RCom’s arguments on January 18. ET on Friday reported CDB planned to withdraw its insolvency filing, while Ericsson planned to continue to fight it out. Shares of RCom surged 7% post CDB’s call, to finally close at Rs 34.05 a piece, up by 2.10% on the BSE on Friday. RCom, weighed down by Rs 45,000 crore of debt, had invoked the SDR programme in 2017. Last month, it announced that through asset monetisation, it will repay its lenders and exit the SDR process. The sale of spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes (MCN) to Reliance Jio for under Rs 24,000 crore is part of this strategy. In a regulatory filing on Friday, RCom said it is working ‘expeditiously'to close asset monetisation programme and “expects to close the same in a phased manner during January-March,” subject to approvals. “Asset sale proceeds shall be utilised to pay the company’s debt, including non-convertible debentures (NCDs) as may be decided by the joint lenders forum,” said the telco. “The company shall not pay or fix any record date for payment of interest on NCDs till the completion of the restructuring process.” CDB, which is RCom's largest lender and Ericsson, had moved the National Company Law Tribunal last November and September respectively, against the operator and its affiliates in a bid to recover its dues. According to the 2012 agreement, Ericsson was responsible for network management and maintenance and after initial few years, payments stopped coming in from 2016 onwards. “Payments became a dribble and then stopped. There was no dispute on the quality of service,” said Khambatta, representing Ericsson. According to court proceedings, the Anil Ambani-owned telecom company had assured that the dues would be cleared, detailing out the turbulence in the industry.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/china-development-bank-withdraws-insolvency-petition-against-reliance-communications/articleshow/62379700.cms

2018-01-06,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) unleashed another price disruption in an heavily debt-riddled industry, wherein all existing tariff plans with 1GB data have been revised to offer either 50% more data or a Rs 50 discount, amove which could hit the average revenue per user of rivals such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.The Mukesh Ambani-owned telco, with some 160 million users, has slashed the prices of four of its plans by Rs 50. So, for example, customers who were paying Rs 199 for 1GB a day will now pay Rs 149 for that amount of data for 28 days. To target the data guzzling subscribers, the new entrant has plans at Rs 198, Rs 398, Rs 448 and Rs 498 with 1.5 GB a day for 28 days, 70 days, 84 days and 91 days respectively. This means while a subscriber gets 1GB a day for Rs 198-199 under the price plan offered by the incumbents such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India, he or she will get 42GB data for a similar price under Jio.For 1GB a day, a customer can also opt for plans priced at Rs 349, Rs 399 and Rs 449 with validity of 70 days, 84 days and 91 days respectively. Competitor Bharti Airtel offers 2GB a day for Rs 349 which is valid 28 days. Jio’s Rs 399 plan, which has been amongst its most popular offer, has been revised to offer 20% additional data with increased validity of 2 additional weeks.Analysts say the new plans, available to the customers from January 9, could hit the average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key industry metric – of incumbents by 20-30%.“How can the incumbents match up? The ARPUs will take a severe beating since incumbents will now have to play catch up,” said a telecom analyst who did not want to be named. And if incumbents match what Jio is offering, their subscribers may want to opt for those lower priced plans, diluting ARPU.ET had earlier written that the industry under a debt of Rs 5 lakh crore has seen a 40% drop in ARPU in the September end quarter compared to same period last year.The telecom industry, engulfed in brutal tariff war, was hoping for stability this year, since the Mukesh Ambani owned telco had inched their tariff plans upwards a couple of times last year.Analysts say that the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology used by the operators is allowing the new entrant more flexibility, say industry analysts. “Jio uses VoLTE which allows more data services at cheaper costs while incumbents are on mainly on 4G LTE services and for them these new plans are cash guzzlers,” said a second analyst who did not want to be named as well.While Jio’s entire network is built on VoLTE while Airtel has just rolled out the technology for its users, and is expanding it across India. Vodafone and Idea have said they will roll it out shortly.“The telco (Jio) is covering customers across all price bands, ensuring more will join them and those who have been their subscribers remain satisfied with the huge data benefits,” said the analyst quoted above. Till now for Rs 149 plan in Jio, a subscriber would get only 4GB data a month.The new offers are meant for telco's Prime subscribers, who are the set of subscribers that have taken up the one-time annual membership fee of Rs.99.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-slashes-tariffs-again-may-hit-rivals-arpu/articleshow/62388378.cms

2018-01-09,"MUMBAI: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) today said it has filed an application before state electricity regulator MERC for approval to sell its Mumbai power business to Adani Transmission (ATL).""RInfra has moved an application before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) for its approval to assign its transmission and distribution licenses and transfer the integrated Mumbai power business to ATL,"" the company said in a statement issued here.The company has sought approvals from MERC for assigning its licenses and transfer the businesses to RInfra's wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Electric Generation and Supply (REGSL), which will then be acquired by Adani Transmission.In December last year, RInfra signed a definitive binding agreement for 100 per cent sale of its Mumbai power business with Adani Transmission for a total deal value of Rs 13,251 crore.In addition, regulatory assets under approval, which is estimated at Rs 5,000 crore and net working capital on closing, estimated at Rs 550 crore, will flow directly to RInfra. This will take the total consideration value to Rs 18,800 crore.With this deal, RInfra, which is sitting on a debt of nearly Rs 20,000 crore, would become debt-free, with up to Rs 3,000 crore cash surplus, the company said.RInfra currently caters to nearly 30 lakh residential, industrial and commercial consumers in the city's suburbs, covering an area of 400 sq km.In November, last year, RInfra completed the sale of its Western Region System Strengthening Scheme transmission undertakings to Adani Transmission for Rs 1,000 crore.The assets under the transaction include Western Region Transmission Maharashtra Project comprising 2,089-circuit km (Ckm) of transmission lines, and Western Region Transmission Gujarat project comprising 974 Ckm of transmission lines.With this acquisition, ATL's total network will be around 11,350 Ckm, of which approximately 9,000 Ckm are under operation.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/reliance-infra-moves-merc-for-sale-approval-of-mumbai-power-biz-to-adani-transmission/articleshow/62430423.cms
2018-01-09,"MUMBAI: The recent tariff reduction by Reliance Jio, which has already left the once-sunshine industry bleeding, will further delay a recovery in rivals' average revenue per user (Arpu) level, which is a key profitability gauge for the industry, warns a report.Reliance-run Jio had last week announced another Rs 50 reduction in its existing plans and/or 50 per cent more data per day on plans ranging from Rs 199-498.""The latest price cut indicates pricing discipline may still be uncertain and highly dependent on consumer behaviour despite industry consolidation paving the way for long-term structural improvements. This move will further delay Arpu recovery,"" India Ratings warned in a note today.""Although current competitive tariffs do not seem sustainable, the short-term Arpu outlook remains subdued, indicating another tough year for the telecom sector,"" it said.Two large telecoms registered an Arpu decline of 25 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, while Jio reported an Arpu of Rs 156 in the same quarter, which was higher than Rs 84 recorded by the industry.While for Jio the entire customers are in broadband data subscribers, for the industry this constitutes only 20 per cent. Non-broadband subscribers are typically low Arpu-generating customers.According to the agency, top telecoms would focus more on increasing their subscriber market share than revenue market share in 2018 and the dual-SIM phenomenon will continue for longer-than-expected, given the low customer loyalty and high price sensitivity.""Thus, the industry pricing trend is moving towards competitive on long validity plans (70-90 days) to increase customer stickiness,"" it says.Mounting pricing pressure, debt burden and capital outlay needs have led to the exit of small telecoms, while the larger ones have prepared themselves for the continued challenging environment through asset sales, besides industry consolidation.The agency had previously predicted a recovery in Arpu in mid-to-late fiscal 2019 as it had expected a stabilisation of industry tariffs at higher levels that would have led to user consolidation.Jio had increased pricing by 40 per cent last October but after that it had reduced the validity on the Rs 309 plan to 49 days from 84 days.

2018-01-10,"In an interview with ET Now, Manish Gunwani, CIO-Equity Investments and Amit Tripathi, Head-Fixed Income, Reliance Mutual Fund, discuss the outlook for the short and the long term. If the fiscal numbers are broadly in order, markets would stabilise over the next two to three months, especially the G-Sec part.Edited excerpts: We have put out two very interesting data points for Reliance Growth and Reliance Banking scheme. Reliance Growth since inception has given a CAGR return of nearly 24%. Reliance Banking Fund has also given a compounded growth return of 25% versus the benchmark. This is after commission and charges. A mutual fund document also contains a red herring line which is that past performance is no guarantee for future return. You have given great returns in the past but what does the future hold?Manish Gunwani: From a market perspective, while the valuations are slightly on the higher side, clearly the earnings cycle has been in the down cycle for a long period of time. So there are serious reasons to believe that the earnings rebound will happen over the next two three years because we are seeing almost unprecedented global growth which we have not seen for seven-eight years. We have a very low base because of GST, demonetisation etc. A lot of election related spending is likely to happen in the next 18 months. Given all these reasons, if we get a good earnings growth which we believe over the next two, three years, equities will continue to remain the preferred asset class for Indian investors and it should give somewhere in the double digit range over three to five years.Equity markets seem nonchalant about the weaker macro which is again odd but given the way the bond yields are moving, it seems that the bond markets are getting extremely stressed about the weaker macros, inflation and the overall impact thereof. Also, with the crude spiralling up at $68.5, do you believe that , these weaker macros are going to daunt equities or is there so much of a missed out feeling in the bull market and with gush of inflows coming in on a day-to-day basis, equity markets would continue to hold on?Manish Gunwani: It is a question of deciding where in the Indian business cycle we are? Are we in the early stage or the later stages? Any business cycle uptick either in India or in emerging markets in general is characterised by rising commodity prices and rising bond yields because by definition when growth comes back, these two will go up. Now the question is whether these are a symptom of growth and whether they lead to macroeconomic instability, typically manifested either in high inflation or high current account deficit. The question today is whether our bounce back in exports will happen because of global growth. Our bounceback in remittances and other foreign exchange earning items will offset the additional drain on forex because of higher commodity prices, especially crude. The key to track is not only crude prices, it is whether our trade deficit number goes beyond a certain threshold of about $15-16 billion.Right now, you are seeing crude as a negative effect on trade deficit but we also have to see as how this whole global growth paradigm supports our export growth. As long as we are below that $15-16 billion trade deficit. I would wait for that kind of indication to be really concerned about crude.What we are seeing in the bond and the fixed income markets is rising yields and falling prices. Now there are two ways to look at it; one, there is expectation that with the economy doing well or the economy recovering, things will look up. If with rising crude oil prices, inflation picks up, then there would be some sort of headroom to raise rates going forward. We are slowly and steadily stepping into a tighter liquidity environment globally and India is not an exception to that and which is why the Indian bond yields are also reacting to the same trend. However, Bill Gross is calling for a big bear market in bonds. So, there are two contrarian dominant views in the market where the jury is still out. Can investments in bond and fixed income markets still generate decent returns?Amit Tripathi: What the markets are clearly pricing is that the best of macro improvements are behind us. The macro improvements that we saw between 2014 and 2017. At least from an incremental perspective, the market does not seem to suggest that we are going to see incrementally more or better macro improvement that what we have seen in the past. If you look at the Indian context as the domestic macro matters much more. The two major variables that markets would anytime track would be the fiscal stance and the fiscal impact and second is inflation. Now while the track record of this government has been excellent, in terms of the fiscal track record, this year has been a bit of a let down from a market perspective given the additional borrowing. What the market is very closely looking at is how does the government approach the FY19 budget. Remember, that while there was some amount of bounty that the government did receive from oil excise duties etc there was some amount of heavy lifting also that the government was doing on behalf of the private sector since private capex was weaker. As we get into FY19, the market would very closely the track the fiscal numbers. If the fiscal numbers are broadly in order, the markets would stabilise over the next two to three months, especially the G-Sec part of it. As far as inflation is concerned, clearly last year’s average of below 4% cannot be repeated in 2019. We are clearly inching towards the 5% and above 5% kind of a mark. If you look at the average numbers for 2019, the oil prices are something that are concerning the markets right now. Unfortunately, oil has a triple impact on the Indian economy. It has impact on inflation, on current account and also on fiscal. So the market is clearly concerned there. The best way to play 2019 possibly would be to look at a combination of three things; one, would be obviously carry. Carry has improved across portfolios in fixed income schemes because of the recent increase in yields. Second, is to have a neutral duration stance given that the visibility in terms of macro improvements is not very great today, while it might stabilise again like I said incremental improvements might be more difficult to come by. And third is how do you play liquidity because there would be seasonality in liquidity, core liquidity still remains reasonably positive and you will see opportunities of making decent returns in products such as ultra short-term funds, short-term funds and FMPs. So, these would form the bulk of strategies clearly within the short term fund category which is doing very well in the last three years which will continue to do well going forward would be the accrual space as well. The neutral duration, focus on carry and wherever potentially you can get rolled on benefits is what the market would want to do more and more in 2018-19. Beside equity funds doing well all of last year and a flood of money coming into the markets through the SIP route, one key theme that stands out for investors is essentially investing in balanced funds. Those funds have also done well in trending market. Where is the opportunity balance that you see between equities and debt at this point? Manish Gunwani: Clearly balanced funds are a good way for investors to manage their asset allocation because it gives them a mix of debt and equity but it is very important to communicate to investors that recent returns should not influence their asset allocation and I guess it is always a natural tendency to look at equities the Nifty is up 30% last year and midcap index is up 40% odd.There is a natural inclination to allocate more to equities which is not advisable because the asset allocation has to be part of a long-term goal and while the balanced fund obviously offers a good mix of debt and equity, it is very important for investors to take into account their current asset allocation based on a mark to market and look at whether something like equities which has done well over recent times whether that is in control because you do not want people to flock to equities purely because of last one year returns. If someone has a long-term goal of say having 50% of net worth in equities, clearly it is not advisable that he or she goes to 70-80% right now. I do not think this is a market where you under allocate to equities but I also do not think it is a market where you over allocate to equities because on a valuation versus earnings growth trade off, you are somewhere in the middle. It is important for people to look at the overall equity asset allocation including the component of equity in balanced funds and keep it in line with the long-term goal.Amit Tripathi: If I can add from a fixed income perspective, the fixed income and equity themes we discussed here is that in portfolios where equity has an overweight in terms of overall allocation, the fixed income PEs has to essentially ensure that it gives a reasonable carry for the portion which is being invested into fixed income without giving too much of volatility.As an asset class, at least in the short run, equity as an asset class would have a slightly higher volatility. Our job here is to ensure that the stability that investors look for when they are investing in balanced funds is being provided by the fixed income allocation there which would typically been neutral duration with a reasonable carry so that investors keep on getting that comfort in balanced funds. Depending on the percentage of equity allocation, the fixed income support strategy would keep on changing. It would be different in a balanced fund whereas in MIP, the fixed income part might be slightly more proactive sort to sayManish, do you think 2018 could be a year of negative returns? We are debating that returns could be in double digit or single digit, but given world economies are unlikely to grow at the 3.2% they clocked in 2017, that global volatility is coming back, markets slowly and silently will recognise that crude is at $70 and macros are not looking great. What are the chances Manish and Amit that we could be in a year of negative returns?Manish Gunwani: I do think that volatility is too low for comforts. It is not only about equities. If you look at all major asset classes globally, whether it is currencies, commodities, bonds, and equities, the volatility is at multi-decade low. You have to budget for the fact that it will come back. Unlike last year, where equities had a unilateral secular run, clearly we have to be prepared for more volatility. However, I would not back a negative return purely from the fact that FY19 earnings are likely to be at the top end of double digits. In a year like that, it is very unlikely to get negative returns although in equities it is better to look at longer time frame as short-term tends to be volatile and could happen but I would not back it.Amit Tripathi: From a fixed income perspective, I would look at it in a slightly more optimistic manner. Once we have done our asset allocation which would predominantly be in the short-term accrual space, I do not think the chance or the case for negative returns actually arises because a large part of your returns has been made through carry. Any which ways we have been trying to tell investors at all points in time, which Manish also mentioned, volatility is one aspect which should never be underestimated irrespective of market conditions and hence you have to decide on the type of funds depending on the tenure. If you are only talking about a one year tenure here and you want to ensure that you do not get negative surprises of a one-year tenure stick to products which are focussed much more on providing a larger part of your returns to carry, stick to reasonable duration. Do not go for very high duration, if your investment horizon is just one year and I do not think you are going to get any negative surprises in spite of whatever is happening around us right now.What are thoughts on pharmaceutical and telecom sectors?. Do you sense contra money could in any which way find its way into these two segments of the market?Manish Gunwani: We are very positive on pharma as a space. We generally think that earnings bottom has happened in this year and from next couple of years, the earnings growth will be healthy. We have been saying that this is the theme which is very attractive at this point of time. We have been recommending our pharma fund which has a good track record of long-term wealth creation as a fund where people can allocate their money. The timeframe is a bit uncertain because when you have global growth lot of the cyclical sectors are likely to do well over let us say six months to one year but from a three to five years perspective, I think it is a sector which plays to India’s competitive strength in terms of talent, in terms of a scale of domestic business which allows companies to scale up and then export. These kind of competitive advantage are very strong in that sector. As for telecom, whenever industries consolidate, historically the equity returns in that sector have been very healthy. While it is a mature sector, the top line growth is not going to be gangbuster but given the fact that the margins and the capital intensity have seen their worst times, we think that the industry dynamics are going to improve from here on.As of now, markets are convinced that earnings recovery is round the corner. Now, this conviction has got challenged in last 12-18 months. What are the chances that we could be in for another round of disappointment on the private capex/economic recovery theme? If the earnings recovery does not start this quarter or next, will markets get impatient, will fund managers like you be forced to rethink your position in cyclicals or industrials?Manish Gunwani: You have to break it up between different parts of the economy. Frankly, from one-to-two-year perspective, we think that heavy private sector capex will come back but we also have to be cognisant of the fact that a fair amount of Nifty earnings or market earnings are linked to global growth. If you look at metals, commodities, energy, lot of exporters of manufacturing companies, they are all linked to global growth and what gives me lot of comfort today is as I said that after seven-eight years you are seeing the kind of economic data globally is very-very strong. That will definitely give a boost to earnings. Second, even on the domestic side, clearly the base is very low. If you look at metrics like bank credit growth, passenger vehicle sales, etc, on a five-six year CAGR basis, are low single digits which has not happened for 25-30 years. So, there are multiple reasons to believe that earnings growth will happen and in that part of the market, which is a bit more cyclical both on the global and domestic cycle, valuations normalised for cyclical earnings are not very stretched. I know that over last five-six years, we have started out maybe positive but ended up with 3% or 4% CAGR on Nifty earnings. I do think that from this base. next two-three earnings growth is going to be very strong.I was just looking at your holdings within the Reliance Equity Opportunities Fund and you have an exposure of about 7% to SBI. Do you see the opportunity in PSU banks or is it just the large cap names that you have conviction with?Manish Gunwani: We do have a preference for the large corporate lending banks with a high CASA ratio and good retail business. Basically, the strong parts of the franchise today are being clouded by credit cost related to corporate lending and if you look at next two-three years, a lot of the credit cost will trend down and the strength of the retail franchise will show up more and more in the numbers and these kind of stocks relative to market valuation look quite attractive. That is the kind of theme we are playing.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/for-next-2-3-years-equities-could-remain-preferred-asset-class-for-investors-manish-gunwani-reliance-mf/articleshow/62442280.cms
2018-01-11,"By Saket Sundria and Bhuma ShrivastavaRichest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s telecom venture is on course to record its first-ever quarterly profit this financial year, aided by the government’s decision to slash interconnection fees, people with knowledge of the matter said. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., a unit of the nation’s most valuable company Reliance Industries Ltd., may report a net income this month itself when it lays out its December-quarter performance, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.The crucial financial milestone would come less that 18 months after Jio, as the company is known, stormed into India’s mobile-phone market with free services that triggered a tariff war and forced consolidation in the sector. Achieving profitability would be one of the parameters that will decide the company’s path to an initial public offering after Ambani pumped at least $31 billion into the venture. Parent Reliance Industries has surged 77 per cent since Jio started operations and dislodged rivals to become the nation’s No. 4 wireless carrier.A Reliance Industries spokesman didn’t respond to an emailed query on Jio’s timeline for reporting profits.“We are ahead of our schedule in terms of the returns that we are generating,” billionaire Ambani had said at a Dec. 1 event without giving any timelines.Jio reported a surprise operating profit in the September quarter, the first time the unit’s results were segregated. It had a net loss of 2.71 billion rupees ($42.5 million) on revenue of 61.5 billion rupees.Costs have since declined substantially after a reduction in the fee an operator pays its counterparts for allowing calls to go through. The saving will flow directly into Jio’s net income, the people familiar said.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India reduced interconnect charges by 57 per cent to 0.06 rupees a minute starting Oct. 1 last year. The fee is set to drop to zero from Jan. 1, 2020.Jio spent more than Rs 21 billion on access charges in the quarter ended September 30, or more than a third of its revenues, according to a company statement.Interconnection CostsThe reduced interconnection costs will be pitted against any increase in depreciation charges and in the interest Jio pays on loans, which would erode net income. If these charges are high enough, the telecom unit may print a loss for the last quarter.“Unfortunately a (unknown) portion of costs are still capitalized as RIL has notyet commissioned its entire telecom infrastructure,” Sanjay Mookim, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst in Mumbai wrote in a January 9 note, explaining why Jio’s earnings numbers are hard to pin down.Cost structures are also likely to change once Jio completes the acquisition of spectrum, tower and fiber assets from debt-laden Reliance Communications Ltd. The deal won’t dent Jio’s December earnings as it is expected to close between January and March.Profits for Jio may be around the corner, boosted by a customer base that has swelled to about 160 million and tariff hikes in October, Jefferies analysts led by Mumbai-based Somshankar Sinha wrote in a Jan. 8 report.Telecom could turn profitable in the three months to December 31 despite higher capital charges, Sinha wrote in the report, describing it as “a quarter of many firsts” for Reliance Industries earnings.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-looks-all-poised-to-register-profit-in-december-quarter/articleshow/62457430.cms

Kindly advise. — UMMED SOLANKIThe merger proposal of Capital First with IDFC Bank is at around 12 per cent premium for Capital First as per the last Friday’s closing prices. Also post-merger, the valuation multiple for the combined entity would be still be comparatively cheaper as compared to other new private sector banks. Hence, hold the stock for the long term.I have 100 shares of ITC at Rs 262.50. How long do I have to hold it to make money? — PS RANAYou may have to hold beyond one to two years to get any significant profits from ITC as the cigarette business is likely to continue to face adversary tax environment and its other FMCG (other than cigarettes) is yet to show any significant profit growth.I have got 5,000 shares of Sintex Industries at an average price of Rs 33 per share after its de-merger. Please suggest whether it will reach Rs 60? — TEJINDER SINGHHold Sintex with a target price of around Rs30. I doubt whether it can touch your target price of Rs60 even in the next three years considering its balance sheet status.I bought 4,000 shares of Udaipur Cements at Rs 31.85. Please advise what to do? — HARMESH ARORAThis loss-making cement company is fairly priced in terms of enterprise value to cement capacity also. Hence, you may consider selling it if it rises another 5 per cent to 10 per cent.I hold 1,000 Cummins India bought at Rs 974.50, 1,000 Shiva Cement bought at Rs 34.70 and 700 Sintex Plastics at Rs 85.40 for past few months now. Planning to keep for a year or so. — P KULKARNISell Cummins India if you recover the cost as at that price it would be valued around 34PE on FY19 expected earnings. You may hold Shiva Cement as JSW Cement has consolidated its holding in it. Plastic producers would have a tough time in near future as crude oil prices have shot up.

2018-01-15,"A young Sajjan Jindal would attend the AGMs of Tata Steel, Birla Group and Reliance Industries to observe the industry leaders at work.  Today, the role of a good mentor in business is more important than ever, and most HNIs and industrialists are willing to share their knowledge with budding entrepreneurs. Some have even created platforms to exchange such ideas. The scene, however, was very different in the mid-1980s, as JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal recalls.  As a young entrepreneur, tasked with the job of turning a sick steel unit into a profitable one and creating a legacy of his own, Jindal didn’t have the “good fortune” of having access to such platforms. So, what did he do? He attended AGMs of other companies like Tata Steel, Reliance Industries and Birla Group.  From the AGMs, Jindal says, he gained insight into how the business leaders of the day tackled stressful situations.  “I would sit in a corner [at the Tata Steel AGMs] and look at the chairman [JRD Tata]. Even Dhirubhai Ambani. Every year, as a ritual, I would sit in the meetings and just observe them. What their reaction was,” says Jindal.  The way each industry leader handled shareholder queries or complaints also gave a peek into their personality. “For instance, Dhirubhai Ambani would react to the shareholders. If someone complained, he would respond very passionately. Aditya Birla would reply calmly, while JRD Tata would just make copious notes till the end of the AGM. Then he would say, ‘My CFO or company secretary will take care of all your questions’. So, as a young person, I learnt a lot from these stalwarts of Indian industry,” Jindal says.  Hero worship It’s no secret that Jindal is an admirer of Jamsetji Tata. When building his own steel factory, his benchmark was Tata Steel. “Jamsetji Tata built the steel plant when there were no drones or satellites to tell you about the location of minerals. Still, he could find the best location in the world to build Tata Steel,” Jindal says. “Jamshedpur is close to the iron ore and coking coal. There cannot be a better site in the world to build a steel plant. I often wonder how he managed to find such an amazing site way back in 1890-95. That’s why he was a real hero for me.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/master-class-sajjan-jindal-learnt-business-skills-by-attending-agms-of-tata-steel-reliance-industries/articleshow/62503130.cms

The Mukesh Ambani-led 4G operator had a net 3.8 million subscribers who opted out of other networks at the end of October, a tiny proportion of the company’s overall users, according to analysis by Kotak. The trend shows that a Jio connection is not the primary number for a good proportion of its subscribers and a large number of its customers continue to also use the services of rival operators, Kotak said. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Jio were the only net gainers from mobile number portability, a facility that allows subscribers to switch their service providers without losing their mobile phone numbers, from the time it started in January 2011 until October 2017, according to data by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The analysis showed that Jio’s net port-in pace increased to about 0.7 million per month between June 2017 and October 2017 from about 0.1 million per month between September 2016 and June 2017. “It is important to note that until end-March 2017, Jio’s services were free and the customers did not really have to make a ‘which operator gets my spend’ choice. Once Jio started charging in April 2017, the customer has had to make a choice between similarly priced bundles of Jio and the incumbents,” Kotak said. According to the Trai data, Idea topped with 25 million net gains, followed by Vodafone and Airtel with 19.4 million and 18.4 million, respectively. Other operators lost a net 66.6 million subscribers, including 21.5 million users from Reliance Communications, 15 million from Tata Teleservices, 13.1 million from Aircel and 6.6 million from Telenor. Although the pace of gross portouts has increased for Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular in recent months, net port-ins remain in the positive zone. While Bharti Airtel lags Idea and Vodafone on cumulative net MNP gains, it has led since Jio’s launch with 9.1 million net gains since September 2016 compared with 6 million for Vodafone and 5.4 million for Idea, Kotak said. The data showed that Bharti’s outperformance versus Idea and Vodafone gained pace between end-June 2017 and end-October 2017, when Bharti gained a net 5million subscribers versus about 2 million each for Idea and Vodafone.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jio-not-preferred-operator-for-mnp-report/articleshow/62530640.cms

2018-01-19,"Despite weak expected refining margin, net profit of Reliance Industries (RIL) is likely to grow 13 per cent year-on-year to Rs 8,496 crore for the December 2017 quarter, according to Bloomberg estimates. A better performance by the petrochemicals segment due to commissioning of new plants will help the country’s largest private sector company by earnings to offset the impact of moderation in refining business.RIL, which owns the world’s largest refinery complex, is scheduled to declare its quarterly results on Friday. Earnings are likely to be driven by the petrochemicals segment, which accounts for almost a quarter of the consolidated revenue and onethird of the operating profit (EBIT) of RIL. The segment will be benefitted by new paraxylene plant and import of ethane. Under the ethane substation project, RIL would lower its dependence on feedstock such as propane and naphtha that are used in ethylene products. RIL has guided to add up to $300-400 million to FY18 due to the ethane import project.These factor will result in another record operating profit for the petrochemicals segment of the company. CLSA, a brokerage, expect petrochemicals volumes to increase by 25 per cent to 4,260 kilo tonnes (KT) in the December quarter compared with 3,386 KT in the year-ago quarter. The prices of most petrochemical products such as HDPE, LDPE, proplyene, paraxylene inched up 3-10 per cent on sequential basis in the December quarter. The EBIT of the petrochemicals division is expected to increase by 57 per cent year-on-year to Rs 5,182 crore.The oil refining business, on the other hand, may see some moderation due to softening of the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) — a gauge for regional refining margins. It is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of the refined products.The Singapore GRM dropped by $0.3 from the previous quarter to $7.2 per barrel in the December quarter as the realisations on petrol and diesel dropped.RIL’s GRM is expected to drop by $ 0.5 sequentially to $11.5 per barrel in the December quarter. Though the refinery volume is expected to remain flat compared with the previous quarter, the 4 per cent appreciation in the rupee against the dollar during the period may hurt realisation. Operating profit of the refining segment may rise by a tad 1 per cent year-on-year to Rs 6,255 crore.Company’s telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm, which turned positive at the EBIT level in the previous quarter, is expected to report net profit of Rs 25-250 crore for the December quarter. The fall in the interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise from 14 paise effective from the beginning of the December quarter will help Jio’s performance.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-q3-net-likely-to-grow-13-on-petrochem-boost/articleshow/62563476.cms
2018-01-19,"Private banks, housing finance and select private insurance companies still offer secular growth opportunities, says Sanjay Parekh, senior fund manager (equity), Reliance Nippon Asset Management. In an interview with Prashant Mahesh, Parekh, who manages Reliance Banking Fund with assets of ₹3,100 crore, reiterates that the outlook for banks looks better in 2019 and 2020. Edited excerpts:What is your outlook for the banking sector? The size of opportunity in banking is large as India is still an underpenetrated market. Any bank which has a strong franchisee on both asset and liability sides is best poised to take advantage of the upcoming economic recovery. Those with a higher retail book and the ones which are managing risk better have commanded premium valuations.We are seeing some signs of an economic recovery and this is showing in credit growth which is now at 11% from 5-7% earlier. We don’t have a full-blown recovery, but we certainly have a gradual recovery. The results will be visible in the March quarter. An economic recovery directly benefits the banking sector, as you will see credit offtake happening. We will see asset-quality resolutions falling in place and overall recovery in credit growth. Wherever credit growth happens, it helps them to participate in the lending cycle. All those things are work in progress, which will show results even in corporate banks where the retail part of the business has been doing exceptionally well.Banking stocks have been one of the best performers in 2017. How are valuations looking?Retail private banks are trading at a price to book of 3.5 to 3.8 times based on 2018-19 earnings. Public sector banks, including corporate banks, and adjusting for subsidiary values, have been in a range of 1.2-1.7 times, and are reasonably valued. If a recovery happens, you could see rerating for corporate banks and there is a good scope for that. However, we believe it would be in sync with the receding of asset-quality problems.How have PSU and corp banks handled the bad-debt problem so far?The bad debt issue is large. We have a ₹10-12-lakh-crore problem, and there is a provisioning of 35-40% on total stress. Every year, when provisioning is done, their coverage also goes up. Resolutions happen through M&A or insolvency proceeding. So, the problem reduces over time. Let’s say on a GDP of ₹160 lakh crore, the gross problem was ₹12 lakh crore. In two years, the GDP would be ₹190 lakh crore. So, if problem reduces and coverage improves, the impact of bad loans seen earlier will be less visible. Also, many stressed sectors like steel are doing well, due to the rise in prices. Gradually, recovery will percolate to other stressed sectors in 2019 and 2020. So, ultimately coverage will go up and credit costs will come down which will lead to higher return on equity (ROE). We believe that 2020 will look better than 2019.Where will you place your bets?We want a blend of private banks with retail focus and very less asset quality problems. We like corporate banks where the worst is behind us. In the next two years, banks with retail franchisee will see good appreciation. We believe there are secular opportunities in private banks, housing finance and select private sector insurance companies.Analysts believe NBFCs, mainly HFCs, are about to see a lot of stress while their valuations are rich...Housing finance companies are not cheap with valuations ranging from 3.5 times to 6 times price to book (P/B). Select NBFCs are expensive while in certain pockets, there is overvaluation as well. Wholesale borrowers which are not able to pass on higher rates could see a squeeze in margins. When the interest rates cycle was low, liquidity was ample, they benefitted as they did not pass on low rates. But now that the 10-year (benchmark bond) has gone up, it will reflect in incremental borrowing at higher rates and in select pockets they will not be able to pass on. Hence, one needs to be careful and take a case by case approach.There were a number of IPOs in insurance? Do you find value there?If you compare India with China, the opportunity in insurance is very large, due to low penetration. We are underinsured and there is product innovation in insurance. Private players are a decade old now, investing in strong franchisees, and return ratios are very good and they could look up further. Regulator is also supportive.

2018-01-19,"Talking to ET Now, Sudeep Anand, Head of Research, IDBI Capital, says petchem will be a big booster for the company and a strong EBIT margin of around 18.3% is expected.Edited excerpts:What is it that you are hoping to hear from Reliance on their GRM trajectory?We are expecting strong numbers once again from Reliance and this time it will be driven by petrochemical rather than refineries. In refineries, we are expecting a GRM of around $11.5 per barrel. Last year, it was $10.8 per barrel but petrochemical would definitely be a big booster for the company and we are expecting a strong EBIT margin of around 18.3%.What is it that you are making of the stock price movement given the kind of expectations that the market has on the oil and gas front as well as the Jio business. The fact that the stock is already at 15 times the estimate of an EPS of about Rs 62 per share and given the kind of run up that we have already seen in the stock would you say that there is scope for the stock to move even higher if the numbers were as per the street estimates?Reliance has almost completed all its capex plan and the company is expected to give very strong results over the next two to three years. We believe that 15 times can easily go up to around 17 times as Nifty and Sensex are trading at much higher level. We believe that with strong performance continuing,, this multiple may go up. So we maintain our buy rating and we have a bullish view on the stock.On Reliance Jio, what kind of commentary do you want to hear on the expansion and what would you be expecting for in terms of subscriber addition for R-Jio?Instead of subscriber addition, the key thing is watch out for the company’s capex plan. We believe that your capex plan on Reliance Jio should be moderated and so quarter on quarter, we are expecting a significant slowdown in your capex and the guidance on the capex for FY19-FY20 so that would be a key trigger and definitely Reliance Jio subscriber addition and kind of data usage the company is having that is would be quite interesting to know and also the kind of ARPU that the company is generating because last quarter the ARPU was at a very high level. We believe that it should come down in this quarter but the kind of ARPU that company report would be a key thing to watch out for.What is the expectation on the petchem and the chemical margins for RIL? We are expecting it to be fairly strong this time?On petrochemical side, we are expecting about 4% quarter-on-quarter jump in terms of petrochemical EBIT and overall EBITDA is expected to grow by about 22% year on year to around Rs 130 billion and net profit is expected to grow by around 4% year on year to around Rs 83.7 billion.I know you talked about how petchem perhaps is of more significance at this juncture than the refining business for Reliance, but please throw in the numbers that you are expecting to hear from Reliance with regards to the GRMs. We are working with an assumption of $11.5 versus about $12 to a barrel on a sequential basis. What are the numbers that you are working with?For this quarter, our expectation is $11.5 per barrel and if you look at the light heavy differential and even the Dubai and Arab heavy differential has contracted by around $0.5-0.7 per barrel. Even on GRM side also, Singapore refining margins have come off. Overall, we are not expecting a very significant jump in your refinery EBIT but because of some of the inventory gains that the company is expected to report, we believe that refinery should also do well.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/petchem-to-drive-reliance-profits-this-quarter-sudeep-anand-idbi-capital/articleshow/62568912.cms
2018-01-19,"Talking to ET Now, Manish Gunwani, CIO-Equity Investments, Reliance Nippon Life AMC, says over the long term, he still thinks that double digit returns should be possible. Edited excerpts:Two weeks from now, the Budget will be presented. This will be the last full Budget of the current government. How exactly is the market positioned, approaching this budget in your view as a market master and a fund manager yourself? As an investor you want macro stability and so you want a low and credible fiscal deficit number. Second, you clearly want a big spend on infrastructure, a way of reviving the rural economy and one of the more important things could be a clear roadmap for PSU bank recapitalisation which has been announced but finer details will be appreciated by the market. The Budget is also a platform when the government actually comes out and talks about the income and expenditure and gives out a message to the market and various stakeholders of the economy. What kind of message would you want from the government regarding the shape of the economy and the sectors and areas they would like to focus more on? For all governments and in particular Indian government, the cost structure is broadly fixed. For the Indian government, almost 80% of salary cost, defence expenditure, interest etc. are broadly fixed. Therefore, the scope for constrainting cost is very limited. The best way to manage the economy from a fiscal deficit angle is to ensure productive expenditure which enables growth leading to higher tax revenues which will give you the top line growth to finally reach a lower fiscal deficit. My view has been that you present a credible budget and if the budget has a slightly higher fiscal deficit but you are able to convince the market than you are going to spend the money on things which improve productivity which keep inflation and current account deficit low, the market will look through the number and we will reach a phase where bond yields do not panic on fiscal deficit. That is the ideal way to do the budget to my mind. As a fund manager, how are you looking at the market right now? Overall, we have crossed 35,500 on the Sensex. The Nifty too is almost knocking at 11000. Are valuations becoming more challenging for you now?If you look at what the market has done especially on the mid and small cap side, clearly after the last 18 months, a fair amount of value has gone out of the market in the sense that the price to earnings, price to book valuations are reasonably high versus historical standards. But the good part is that from an earnings cycle viewpoint, over last four-five years. we have seen market earnings compounding at only 4% in economy when nominal GDP is much higher than that. We clearly think that the earning cycle is about to take off. Given these two effects we broadly think it is a middling market and you should have realistic returns. But over the long term, I do still think that double digit returns should be possible. The year gone by has been very good, particularly from the DII side in terms of flows, almost Rs 6000 crore coming in every month. How do you see the flows picture pan out in 2018? On the one hand, do you expect DII flows to continue and on the other do you see FII flows come back? How would this FII versus DII on the flow front pan out in 2018?If you look at what has been happening on the global front, emerging markets have been getting lot of flows. In the calendar year 2017, India got relatively less flows because the emerging markets, which had gone down a lot between 2011-2016, the commodity dominant countries like Brazil, Russia etc got probably higher allocation on flows. The emerging market as a basket seems to be growing very well and if that happens, I do see that emerging market funds will get flows and this year India will probably get a better allocation in which case the FII flows to India will be very strong. Earnings season is clearly panning out right now. How are you seeing the script from hereon? Do you expect earnings momentum to only improve? What has been your analysis of the numbers which have been declared so far?I do think that over the next two three years, we should get a very strong earnings cycle because global growth is strong. We are coming off a very weak year because of DeMon and GST. Elections are coming up and spending is expected to stimulate the economy. I do think we are heading into a couple of years of fairly strong earnings growth.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/want-a-credible-budget-with-productive-expenditure-manish-gunwani-reliance-capital-mf/articleshow/62569382.cms

2018-01-19,"NEW DELHI: The telecom regulator has directed Reliance Communications (RCom) and its unit Reliance Telecom (RTL) to return unspent balance and security deposits to customers after it closed voice services in several circles. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Friday said it has issued notices to the Anil Ambani companies, asking them to return the unused balance of the telcos’ prepaid customers and security deposit of the postpaid subscribers by February 15, and report compliance by March 31. RCom had told Trai in October 2017 that it would close 2G services in several circles from December 1. In November, RCom and RTL informed the regulator that both companies would close their voice services in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh and Mumbai, and in the licensed service areas of Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh, North East, Orissa, and West Bengal by RTL, with effect from December 29. In the last week of December, Ambani announced that RCom’s optical fibre network, towers and spectrum would be sold to elder brother Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm, to resolve its outstanding debt issue with lenders. The deal size is estimated to be Rs 23,000-24,000 crore. Trai’s directive is aimed at benefiting RCom’s prepaid subscribers who after the discontinuation of RCom’s 2G GSM and CDMA voice services were unable to port out to other networks.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/trai-directs-reliance-communications-to-refund-unspent-money-of-mobile-customers/articleshow/62571452.cms
2018-01-19,"Reliance Jio Infocomm posted a net profit of Rs 504 crore for the fiscal third quarter, its first within 15 months of start of commercial operations, buoyed by strong subscriber additions and cost efficiencies, including sharply lower payments on account of interconnect charges.The Mukesh Ambani-owned company, which upended the market since its entry in September 2016 with its initially free voice and data and now much cheaper mobile internet services, has posted a revenue of Rs 6.879 crore, up nearly 12% on quarter. India’s fourth largest telco by user base had recorded a net loss of Rs271 crore in the previous three-month period ended September, which was also the first quarter when it formally reported results.“Jio’s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives. Jio has demonstrated that it can sustain its strong financial performance,” Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries Ltd., also Jio’s parent.The new telecom entrant’s average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key performance parameter - stood at Rs 154, the same as in the fiscal second quarter. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) was Rs 2,628 crore in October-December period, surging over 82% sequentially, with an Ebitda margin of 38.2%, compared with 23.5% in the previous quarter.Jio, which added a net 21.5 million to end December with 160.1 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network which have more number of users, and is thus a net payer of interconnection usage charges (IUC), which were reduced by the telecom regulator by 57% from October 1. In the latest third quarter, Jio’s paid nearly Rs1,082 crore as IUC, less than half of the nearly Rs2,140 crore it paid in the previous quarter.“The (IUC) reduction will continue as IUC rates have been slashed,” Anshuman Thakur, Jio’s head of strategy and planning, told reporters. “We are creating enormous capacity. Costs have been incurred, now it will be on more revenue generated. That scale benefit is contributing to improving the profits number and this revenue will go up, not costs,” Thakur added, indicating higher profitability going forward.Network operating expenses was at around Rs1,737 crore, compared with nearly Rs1,372 crore in the second quarter, while depreciation & amortization costs rose a tad to Rs1193 crore from 1184 crore. Total expenses fell nearly 7% sequentially to Rs6,109 crore.Jio’s performance came a day after market leader Bharti Airtel posted a 39% on year drop in its net profit to Rs306 crore, hurt majorly by he cut in IUC and the ongoing price war, on a 13% decline in revenue, with ARPU at Rs 123, its lowest ever. Airtel’s India mobile business revenue was at RS10,751 crore, down 22% on year, while Ebitda at Rs 3,509 crore, slumped 34%.""The (Jio) results reflect a strong quarter the growth in data and subscriber base, which continues to be impressive,"" Mritunjay Kapur, head of telecom, media and technology at KPMG India.However, not all analysts were convinced.""The numbers in turning positive on EBIDTA & PAT are difficult to accept in such a short period given the high cost. But they're there, and it is quite clear that Rel Jio has benefited from IUC cut where others have taken a hit. Airtel's numbers are down and Idea will follow suit,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, an analyst at brokerage IIFL. Jio has come out with tariff plans across price ranges and even cash back offers to get more market share, and such offers will continue, said Thakur. “We will offer more to customers, we have the capabilities to do so. Cashback offer impact will be seen in the next (ongoing quarter),” Thakur said, also noting that the company had raised rates twice in the recent past.Chief Financial Official Srikanth added that the recent rate cuts by Jio were a reaction to competitors’ dropping prices.Total wireless data traffic in the quarter was 431 crore GB, far higher than its more established rivals such as Bharti Airtel which recorded 110 crore GB. Average data consumption per user per month of 9.6 GB while total voice traffic was 694 minutes per user per month. Airtel, in comparison, recorded 575 minutes per user, while data usage a subscriber was 5,349 MBs.Jio saw 1.4% of users moving to another network, compared with Airtel’s 3.3%.Debt stood at Rs51-52,000 crore, on an equity base of 100,000 crore. The company recorded capex of some Rs7,000 crore in the December quarter, said Thakur.On a buying spree, last month Jio inked a definitive agreement to acquire wireless assets of Reliance Communications and its affiliates in an all-cash deal for upto Rs 24,000 crore.“We are getting approvals (for closing the RCom asset buys). These are not related party transactions,” Thakur said.On being asked if Jio will be keen on the balance some 130 Mhz of spectrum that RCom still holds, Thakur said, “We will be looking at all spectrum available”.After a rapid start when Jio hit a record 100 million users in 170 days, the pace of subscriber addition slowed as it began charging for data – albeit at sharply lower rates than others – from April and due to the limited number of 4G smartphones in the market. The company then launched the JioPhone – the 4G VoLTE featurephone – and have claimed to have sold more than 600 million so far, in its attempt to target the 600 million odd basic phone users. “There were certain supply constraints that we faced, which have been overcome. Now you will see more of such phones, demand has been phenomenal and our way of empowering 530 million odd consumers who did not have Jio network,” Thakur said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-reports-net-profit-of-rs-504-crore-in-q3/articleshow/62571929.cms

2018-01-20,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries reported a 25% rise in quarterly earnings to a records, exceeding expectations, as its giant Jamnagar refinery again delivered hefty margins and the petrochemicals business boomed, while the Jio telecom unit that disrupted the market with cheap data and free calls quickly turned profitable.The company said the outlook for its main businesses is positive as it gains from acceleration in India’s economic growth and a favourable global environment. Consolidated net profit for the December quarter rose to Rs 9,423 crore while turnover rose 30.5% to Rs 1,09,905 crore from the year earlier. Standalone profit rose 5.4% to Rs 8,454 crore against expectation of Rs 8.394 crore.Reliance Jio Infocomm, the conglomerate’s newest venture, reported a net profit of Rs 504 crore in the quarter, making its first positive contribution to the balance sheet. Jio has grown rapidly since its commercial launch in September 2016. Its 160.1 million subscribers are using an average 9.6 gigabytes of data and 694 minutes per month, it said.“Jio’s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives,” chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a statement.Petchem Operating Profit up 73%“Jio has demonstrated that it can sustain its strong financial performance. We are excited about the prospects of both our energy and consumer businesses due to strong growth in Indian markets and constructive macro environment,” he said.CFO Alok Agarwal said the company expects to gain from stronger growth at home. “After some temporary headwinds in India, we are seeing acceleration in growth in India and strong growth across each of the products that we manufacture,” he said.The company’s petrochem segment, which is delivering strong earnings, is expected to make handsome gains from new capacities. “Our capacities in petrochemicals are coming on stream at a time when the global macro environment is positive and looks to remain so for several years,” Agarwal said.Ambani said the outlook was exciting with the Jamnagar refinery achieving impressive double-digit margins for 12 consecutive quarters, heavy petrochemicals starting to show results and bright prospects for the consumer businesses.The petrochemicals segment’s operating profit rose 73% toRs 5,753 crore, while EBIT margin expanded to 17.1% in the quarter from 14.6% a year ago.The refining and marketing business saw revenue rise 23% to Rs 75,865 crore in the quarter that saw crude prices rise to a three-year high. Refining margin, or the money it makes from producing fuels from each barrel of crude oil, rose to $11.6 in the quarter from $10.8 a year ago. Operating profit was Rs 6,165 crore, slightly lower than the yearearlierRs 6,621crore.The segment’s exports rose to $5.8 billion from $4.9 billion. Demand is buoyant, the company said.“Global oil demand growth is estimated at 1.5 m barrels/day for 2017 driven by growth in China and other Asia-Pacific markets,” it said. “The current forecast for global oil demand growth for 2018 is encouraging at 1.3 m barrels/day.”In the organised retail business, which runs 3,751 stores in 750 cities as well as 479 petro outlets, revenue more than doubled to Rs 18,798 crore from Rs 8,688 crore in the quarter in which it added 71 stores.

2018-01-20,"Reliance Industries Ltd.’s third-quarter net profit of a record Rs 9,423 crore exceeded street estimates by 12% and may reinforce investor confidence in earnings growth, which is being driven by the commissioning of new plants.RIL invested close to $20 billion in hydrocarbon projects, which started commissioning in phases in the previous financial year. The latest earnings could translate into an upward revision in the consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the current year.This could rekindle investor interest in the stock as returns in the past three months were lower than that of the benchmark stock index. The consensus EPS for FY18 stood at Rs 54.41 before the quarterly results, while the nine-month EPS of RIL in the current financial year is Rs 45. This indicates room for upward revision.The combination of higher volume growth in the petrochemicals business and profitability of Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom wing, were the principal reasons for the earnings bettering expectations.Revenue in the petrochemicals business increased 47% to Rs 33,726 crore due to higher volumes and prices. The switch to ethane that cut dependence on propane and naphtha as feedstock for ethylene production, helped RIL’s operating profit in the petrochemicals segment rise 73% to Rs 5,753 crore.The substitution project requires RIL to import 1.6 million tonnes of ethane from the US every year. The company has indicated that the ethane import project could add $300-400 million to FY18’s operating profit in the petrochemical segment and this appears to have started showing in the December quarter financials.Profitability will likely remain buoyant in the petrochemical segment as the company recently commissioned a $4.5 billion refinery off-gas cracker plant, which will produce higher value-added polymer derivatives with off-gas from its two refineries. The returns of the RoGC units are expected to be superior for the company thanks to the lower project cost compared with similar gas crackers installed in the US.The petrochemical segment helped to offset moderation in earnings of the refining segment due to softness in the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM)—a regional oil processing benchmark. GRM is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products.The Singapore GRM dropped by $0.3 from the previous quarter to $7.2 per barrel in the December quarter as realisations on petrol and diesel fell. As a result, the RIL’s GRM declined $0.4 per barrel to $11.6 in the December quarter from the previous quarter. The base GRM is expected to improve in the range of $0.8-1.5 per barrel with the commissioning of the pet coke gasification project worth $5 billion.The company said the pet coke project would be commissioned in the fourth quarter of the current year. Higher crude oil prices have a greater potential to improve the cost economics of the pet coke gasification project.Reliance Jio, the telecom division, posted its first quarterly profit of Rs 504 crore, which was almost double the street’s expectations, on a better operating profit. Jio’s operating profit improved to 38.2% in the December quarter from 23.5% in the previous quarter as interconnection charges were cut by 57%.With a subscriber base of 160 million and average revenue per user of Rs 154, Jio’s focus should now shift to monetisation of its industry-leading capacity. The street will keenly watch the trajectory of ARPU from its smartphone users, the ramp-up of its 4G feature phone, the launch of home broadband and the start of enterprise solutions.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-ltd-s-record-net-profit-of-rs-9423-crore-beats-estimates/articleshow/62577251.cms
2018-01-20,"Talking to ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says for Reliance, refining should do well but the petchem side of the business can be something of an outlier.Edited excerpts: ET Now:Reliance Jio profitability is at Rs 500 crore, what is your reaction?Mayuresh Joshi: It is a phenomenal number and after the last quarter when they had really done well both on the top line and on the EBIT front, it is a commendable performance to report profits specifically on the Jio business. Again, a large part of the market believes that a significant amount of capital expenditure on the telecom side is largely behind and to that extent, the incremental capex is going to be far lesser and the synergies in terms of pricing, specifically in terms of even their lowest priced pack should ensure that ARPUs are probably maintained and the trajectory remains on the higher side. It is a very positive number from Jio to help the consolidated numbers of RIL along with its core businesses. ET Now: The stock was up 1.5% going into the number, do you think it will witness some profit taking purely from the traders point of view with this kind of performance on Monday?Mayuresh Joshi: It is a possibility but the petchem business was operating out of a very tough environment because Reliance is an integrated player. They have probably seen better margins than most players at least on the petchem side because LDP, HDP prices have actually moved up. Even if you look at the deltas, the gasoline deltas were probably lower and the aiding aspect would have come from jet deltas. Naptha deltas are probably aiding that but with the off gas cracker coming through specifically on the petchem side, the future quarters numbers will look far better.At the same time, since they have started importing ethane, the costlier part of which was in the form of naptha, there will be significant cost savings happening on that front. And even the ethylene production should increase significantly. The petchem margins have been quite reasonable in my opinion and they should improve because of the integrated nature. The GRMs are on expected lines and over the next few quarters, as the gasifiers start coming through on the balance sheet in terms of that capex getting over again, it will prove to be the one aspect which can aid the earnings growth. A large element of the next few quarters is going to be at the core business earnings, showing stability and improvement in earnings metrics and that will improve the results as whole. It is a possibility that there might be some profit booking but remember it is a good set of numbers specifically on the EBIT front because of the tough environment that RIL was working at this point of time, specifically in the petchem. ET Now: How do you rate the refining environment right now? The trajectory around $12 has been maintained for six months now but there are sections of oil and gas industry globally which believe that refining may start turning soft going into 2018. What are your thoughts on refining as a whole for Asian refiners and refining margin trajectory?Mayuresh Joshi: For Asian refiners, there might be some marginal softness creeping through but the dynamics are very much in favour of large refiners because the kind of demand situation that we are seeing at this point of time and the kind of additions that we are probably seeing in terms of refining capacities getting put up, somewhere, the refiners are going to benefit because of this demand-supply dynamics. Secondly, if you look at how the core spreads are expected to pan out, it is a mix. Every quarter will probably see some amount of elevation or some amount of softness happening in either of the core constituents whether it is naphtha, jet or gasoline. The spreads is something very critical from a refiners’ perspective but somewhere the complexities that Reliance is able to manage and the way it does that because of the complexity of its refining plants, is the entire premise why it gets that premium of around $4 odd compared to the Singapore GRMs. To a large extent, the softness can happen but Reliance is a better place because of its complexities and demand supply dynamics. Going into 2018 should actually favour refiners more and the margins should get protected with not a great downfall in terms of margins getting deteriorated. Refining should do well but the petchem side of the business is something that can be an outlier for Reliance. ET Now: Do you think that is something that the street needs more clarity on whether or not the Jio business is going to suck in more money because it is a cash guzzling business?Mayuresh Joshi: Absolutely. And again, that is one important figure that the markets will tend to watch out for and largely the kind of moves that we have seen so far in terms of pricing moving up, pricing moving down, that environment can still continue. Blended ARPUs can actually get reported.The revenue market share that Reliance can actually garner going forward, what they do in terms of their capabilities on the fibre optic broadband is something to be observed, specifically in terms of R-Com assets. Further clarity from Jio could bring in higher estimates if they are able to clarify on an SOTP basis. But the core businesses are doing fine and as certain elements of their core businesses start coming through like petcoke gasifiers, the incremental earnings from the core businesses should come through. They did a $17-billion capex in FY17. If the capex is expected to taper off this year and in coming years as well, unless they have ambitious capex plan which then again reworks a lot of numbers.I remain positive on the stock. I am not ascribing any numbers unless I hear the concall, but the positive nature in terms of earnings outlook should continue and a disclaimer we own the stock in our funds.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/jio-numbers-phenomenal-helped-consolidate-ril-profit-in-q3-mayuresh-joshi-angel-broking/articleshow/62578319.cms
2018-01-20,"Within 15 months of starting commercial operations, Reliance Jio Infocomm turned profitable, posting a net profit of Rs 504 crore for the third quarter of the fiscal year. It had posted a net loss of Rs 271 crore in the previous quarter. It clocked a revenue of Rs 6.879 crore, up nearly 12% on quarter. Jio's rivals are facing tough times. Bharti Airtel's third-quarter net profit plunged 39%, missing estimates and dropping for the seventh straight quarter. Idea Cellular, too, is expected to post a loss as it has been doing for quite some time.A major reason for Jio's profit and loss of Airtel is the 57% cut in the interconnection usage charge (IUC) by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India from 1 October last year. IUC is paid by telcos generating calls to networks that receive them. Bharti Airtel, India's largest telco with over 289 million mobile customers, along with Vodafone India and Idea Cellular account for over 60% of the country's mobile users. They are net receivers of calls. With the in IUC, they were net revenue losers. Jio, which added a net 21.5 million to end December with 160.1 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network which have more number of users, and is thus a net payer of IUC. In the latest third quarter, Jio’s paid nearly Rs 1,082 crore as IUC, less than half of the nearly Rs 2,140 crore it paid in the previous quarter.While it's first quarterly profit is an important milestone and the IUC gives it an edge over its rivals, Reliance Jio's ascendancy is fuelled mainly by its disruptive strategy. The Jio juggernaut rolled into the market on low prices and freebies and it is likely to keep giving trouble to its rivals as its further sharpening it strategy. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani is the man who has his finger on the pulse of Indian consumer. In a speech at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence recently, Ambani said when the fashion was to invest abroad, Reliance took a contrarian bet to invest Rs 3.5 lakh crore in India and that has paid off handsomely. Ambani was talking of his telecom venture, Reliance Jio, that disrupted the sector with freebies and a flood of cheap data. After its smashing entry and now the first profit, Jio is making another contrarian bet. When retail companies are logging into India, Ambani is betting big on Bharat. Amazon and Flipkart may be putting billions of dollars in e-commerce wars, Ambani plans to ride high on the corner shops—the small kirana stores.

It will not spend its own money on discounts. It will only mediate between manufacturers and kirana stores to benefit its subscribers. While manufacturing brands will get free publicity, kirana stores will have more customers. And it will be an effective way to add and retain subscribers for Jio. The company is running a pilot project of this scheme at a few cities before it rolls out the scheme some time this year.The clever plan to link brands, kirana shops and consumers through the growing Reliance Jio network can spread like wildfire in the hinterlands. This will be yet another wave of disruption by Jio.The launch of Reliance Jio last year disrupted India's telecom market—and kept on disrupting it. Its stormy entry into $26 billion Indian telecom market riding on big freebies last year changed rules of the game. Apart from free voice for life, Jio didn’t charge for data for the first six months. It started charging for data from April 1, but at much lower rates than rivals. That wasn't the end of disruption. It came out with another disruptive ploy—a 4G feature phone, which was virtually free of cost, targeting predominantly rural feature-phone users who wish to switch to a smartphone but find it expensive. With its kirana venture, Ambani will prove that disruption is the chief strategy of Jio. He is sure to keep rivals on their toes.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/after-reliance-jios-first-profit-mukesh-ambani-is-ready-for-another-contrarian-bet/articleshow/62579912.cms
2018-01-22,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio's positive earnings played a decisive role in RIL's quarterly show, which was powered by the petrochemical business where margin surprised many. Analysts noted that the grandiose $20-billion capex too has started yielding results, pointing to a significant lift in earnings for Reliance Industries in days to come.Post results, analysts have upped the target of the oil-to-telecom major, suggesting up to 30 per cent upside from the prevailing level. CLSA has a fresh target of Rs 1,125 for the stock, from Rs 1,080 earlier, while Nomura India has a target of 1,220 on the scrip.The revision in targets has come at a time when another foreign brokerage UBS gave the stock a 'sell' rating on fears that $60-billion mega investments by the company are unlikely to start generating cash anytime soon. Reliance’s premiums to Singapore complex are likely to further widen as it starts its petcoke gasification project over the next few months, said Nomura India. ""Petcoke gasification (PCG) will use bottom-of-barrel petcoke as feedstock to produce higher value syn-gas. The syn-gas will be used as fuel in refining and petchem complex and release higher value off-gases for use as feedstock in refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC). Once fully on-stream, we expect PCG to expand Reliance’s premiums to SG benchmark by further $2-2.5/bbl,"" the brokerage said, adding that the refining and chemical cycle upturn since 2015 will likely last for another 24 months.The oil major on Friday reported a 25.10 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 9,423 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 7,533 crore in the year-ago quarter. Gross Refining Margin (GRM) for Q3 FY18 stood at $11.6/bbl as against $10.8/bbl in Q3 FY17. The company's GRM outpaced Singapore complex refining margin by $4.4/bbl. GRM is likely to remain strong due to structurally low utilisation in Latin America and Africa, which are home to 12 per cent of global capacity, said Motilal Oswal Securities. The brokerage noted that petrochemical deltas have shown strength due to strong demand and a delay in the commissioning of new projects in the US.""Although petcoke gasifier has been delayed further to FY19, completion of the rest of the projects would help generate strong free cash flow, going forward.

2018-01-23,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) may soon topple Idea Cellular and Vodafone India individually in revenue market share, on the back of Mukesh Ambani-led telco's ability to spend more in capital expenditure. Jio’s revenue though is expected to surpass that of the Aditya Birla group telco in the fiscal third quarter itself, say analysts.""In our view, Idea could lose some market share in the near term as its spend on capex remains significantly lower versus Bharti/Jio,"" said brokerage firm Goldman Sachs in its report. It added that Jio’s reported revenues of Rs 6,900 crore likely translates into a market share rank of three. ""We forecast Rs 6,300 crore (wireless) revenues for Idea in third quarter,"" said Goldman Sachs.JP Morgan estimates Idea's revenues to be at Rs 6,700 crore. India’s current No. 3 carrier is expected to report a net loss—its fifth successive quarterly loss—in the October-December period, when it declares its third quarter results on Wednesday. In comparison, Jio, which upended the market since its entry in September 2016 with its initially free voice and data offerings, posted a profit of Rs 504 crore and a 12% on-quarter increase in revenue to Rs 6,879 crore for the third quarter. Airtel’s India mobile services revenue was at Rs 10,571 crore.At end of FY18, Goldman Sachs estimated revenue market share for Bharti Airtel at 31.7 per cent, Vodafone India at 21.4 per cent, Idea Cellular at 17.2 per cent and Jio at 12.1 per cent. By FY19, Airtel’s share is expected to slip to 30.6 per cent, Vodafone’s to 20.2per cent, Idea’s to 16.2 per cent while Jio’s is likely to rise to 21.5 per cent. Idea and Vodafone, which are in the process of merging operations, should become the combined No. 1 with a combined share of 36.4 per cent.The Kumar Mangalam Birla-led operator had in the beginning of the financial year announced a capex plan of Rs 6,000 crore and had utilised Rs 3,200 crore by the end of the second quarter. The balance amount was kept aside for the third and fourth-quarters. In contrast, Jio's capex for the third quarter was Rs 7,000 crore.According to analysts' estimates, Idea Cellular's average revenue per user (ARPU) for the third quarter will be around Rs 115 compared to Jio and Airtel's ARPU at Rs 154 and Rs 123 respectively. The slash in interconnect user charges (IUC) rates would “negatively impact” Idea’s mobile revenue by 10per cent on quarter, ICICI Securities said in a report. The decrease in IUC hurt Airtel’s gross revenue by Rs 1,061.5 crore, and mobile ARPU by Rs 16.Bank of America-Merril-Lynch in its report said Idea’s expected churn of 5.8 per cent, compared to Jio's 1.4 per cent and Bharti Airtel's 3.3 per cent. The brokerage firm estimates that the Birla-owned telco may get 2.6 million subscriber additions in the December end quarter while Jio added 21.5 million and Bharti Airtel added 8.1 million in the same period.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-likely-to-surpass-idea-vodafone-revenue-market-share-individually-shortly-analysts/articleshow/62621420.cms

Overall featurephone shipments surged by 51% on-year and a massive 32% sequentially, when compared to the 10-12% and 6-7% that the industry generally ships, respectively.“JioPhone brought in huge volumes in the quarter, due to which it was able to surpass Samsung, which typically leads this segment,” said Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint. “The device saw traction as featurephone users moved to the JioPhone and could use the similar form factor device to consume data as against the voice only earlier.”Jio has recently said it would look at a strong ramp up and relaunch of JioPhone from next month, after having resolved supply issues of battery and chipsets that had constrained shipments initially. It had sold over 6 million handsets in the first phase since start of bookings late August. Bookings were discontinued soon after, and resumed in November.People familiar with the matter added that Reliance Retail has shipped over 15 million JioPhones in the October-December period, of which most came in during the latter months. Of this, around 80% have been sold to consumers.Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio did not comment on future shipments, sales or tariff plans, while Samsung did not comment on the changed rankings.“There were certain supply constraints that we faced, which have been overcome. Now, you will see more of such phones,” Reliance Jio’s strategy head Anshuman Thakur had said.To make the JioPhone more attractive, Jio has further increased daily data allowance for Rs 153 a month plan, including Rs 99 as Prime membership for a year, associated with JioPhone to 1.5 GB from 1 GB, starting January 26.

That shorting opportunity is not there yet. As both the market and RIL are on a strong footing, shorting the stock may not be a great idea at this point. The stock may be on the verge of a big breakout after registering lifetime highs after December quarter earnings, said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.He said traders should make use of dips to go long on this counter. “Best buying opportunity shall arise in the Rs 940-934 zone for a target of Rs 1,020,” he said.RIL posted a 25 per cent rise in third quarter profit on the back of higher refining margins and profits on the book of its telecom arm Reliance Jio.Consolidated net profit in October-December stood at Rs 9,423 crore while standalone earning grew 5.4 per cent to Rs 8,454 crore.Brokerage Edelweiss Securities says RIL’s core performance was mixed in Q3FY18 with refining EBIT coming in below estimate at 8 per cent, even as GRM missed estimate by 2 per cent. However, petchem EBIT surpassed estimate by 17 per cent amid robust volume growth, healthy polypropylene and downstream polyester margins and benefits from recent downstream projects.Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory says he does not see any shorting opportunity on the counter as of now.“The stock has achieved a breakout from a sideways consolidation of last three months when it moved past the Rs 955 mark. The retracement from the high of Rs 996 is nothing but a classical throwback,” he said.Throwback occurs when a stock returns to the same point from where it had broken out on the upside. Throwback mainly occurs because of the overbought nature of the security and this usually happens with lower-than-average volume. This was exactly the case on the RIL counter. Vaishnav expects the stock to take support around the Rs 953-955 levels. Only, if this level is breached, will the breakout fail and fresh shorting opportunity arise, he said.Brokerage firms Kotak Securities and CIMB have ‘reduce’ ratings on RIL with price targets of Rs 835 and Rs 770, respectively.

This will be Jio's second tariff revision in the new year and price war is mainly on data packages. Brokerage UBS said Jio’s management had suggested the company’s focus on market share gain and offering higher value to customer compared to incumbents. “We believe APRU increase for the industry is more likely a CY19 story as top three operators continue to vie for market share stability in CY18.”The Mukesh Ambani-led company, which upended the market since its entry in September 2016 with its initially free voice and data offerings, posted a profit of Rs 504 crore and a 12% on-quarter increase in revenue to Rs 6,879 crore in the three months ended December.The new offers are meant for telco's Prime subscribers, who are the set of subscribers that have taken up the one-time annual membership fee of Rs 99.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-republic-day-offer-50-more-data-on-offer-various-plans-now-cheaper-by-rs-50/articleshow/62621667.cms
2018-01-24,"MUMBAI: Reliance Retail has got into the list of top 250 global retailers list this year, at No. 189, validating the country's strong growth in consumer spending, a recent report said.""Reliance generates the bulk of its sales from its (fast moving consumer goods) FMCG banners. The company recorded a robust 59.2 per cent growth in retail revenue in the financial year 2015-16,"" said the report on global powers of retailing by Deloitte Global.The retailing subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL), also operates in the apparel and accessories space with its Reliance Trends and Reliance Footprint nameplates, and in hardlines through its Reliance Digital consumer electronics chain.""The India retail story continues to be promising. Having faced demonetisation and GST, the retail sector in India will soon be poised for a CAGR of more than 10 per cent in the coming year,"" Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte India said.""Opening up of FDI for single brand retail trade has provided a stimuli for global retailers to decide their Indian entry and presence,"" he said.The consumption potential continues to be strong and attract retail companies to focus on new ways of tapping the Indian market. Digitisation and technology are predicted to play a key role in the strategy of the Indian retailer, the report noted.Some of the trends as stated in the report are sighted in India as well like innovation, collaboration, consolidation, integration and automation.""Further, these need to be looked at from the lens of the young consumer. Thus, the overall theme of transformative change and reinvigorated commerce resonates well with the Indian retail market,"" Talreja added.With the advent of these trends in India as well as regulatory support, it is very likely that Indian companies will start showing up on the global list very soon in the coming years, he further pointed out.The retail growth in the country has been strong all along, in part due to the fact that the country is not dependent on commodity exports.Lately, growth has decelerated owing to the temporary effect of structural reforms such as demonetisation and implementation of a new goods and services tax.Yet the longer-term outlook remains strong, especially as those reforms are likely to have a positive long-term benefit, the report said.It pointed out that top 250 global retailers generated aggregated revenues of USD 4.4 trillion in 2016 fiscal year, representing composite growth of 4.1 per cent.The top five largest retailers maintained their positions on the leader board.""A combination of organic growth, acquisitions and exchange rate volatility shuffled the rest of the Top 10-which now accounts for 30.7 per cent of the overall Top 250's retail revenue, compared to 30.4 per cent last year,"" the report said.Europe's share of the Top 250 dropped again, with 82 retailers based in Europe and the gap widened versus North America, it added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-breaks-into-top-250-list-of-global-retailers/articleshow/62635685.cms
2018-01-24,"NEW DELHI: Mobile data rates will see a further drop to as low as Rs 2.7 per GB with Reliance Jio announcing extra 500 MB data for its users of select plans as part of 'Republic Day offer', says a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.As per calculations done by the BoFA-ML analysts, per GB data will cost Rs 2.7 under the Jio's Rs 448 and Rs 498 plans, under which the company will offer 2GB 4GB data per day and speed will reduce after the limit is consumed.These plans have validity of 84 and 91 days, respectively.Earlier, under the 'Happy New Year offer', Jio had reduced cost of data per GB to Rs 4.""The new tariffs imply 25-33 per cent implied tariff cuts. This is the second ""implied tariff"" cut by Jio this month and signals Jio's intention to continue to focus on sub additions until it reaches a particular scale. Jio also introduced a new plan for Rs 98 that provides access to 2G data per month - this looks more like a feature phone offering,"" the report said.Jio's closest rival Bharti Airtel data cost per GB has dropped to Rs 4 under its new schemes.The tariff of Rs 2.7 per GB data is about 99 per cent lower compared to Rs 249-259 per GB charged by established big operators till August 2016 -- before commercial launch of Jio services.Jio's announcement of Republic Day scheme, under which users will get 500MB extra data per day across existing plans, within days of Airtel announcing the scheme priced at Rs 399 offering 1GB 4G data daily with 84 days validity.""It is very logical to assume that, after Jio's strong signalling at its analyst day, Airtel knew that Jio would follow up on any tariff cut. Despite this, Airtel launched these new offers. We believe that it is investing heavily to build a strong network that can sustain high traffic. We now see the market moving to 1.5GB per day plans from 1GB per day. We find smaller telcos vulnerable in this ""network capacity war,"" BoFA ML report said.A Credit Suisse report said that in over the last three weeks, effective tariff, measured as Rs per GB daily allowance, would have come down by 40-50 per cent.""In our earlier note, we had highlighted our concern that the Rs 149 plan could become the de facto ceiling on monthly spend for customers (thus limiting average revenue per user). This was also alluded to by Bharti Airtel management on their earnings call that there is some room for ARPUs to decline further,"" Credit Suisse report said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/users-to-pay-rs-2-7-for-per-gb-data-after-new-reliance-jio-offer-report/articleshow/62637251.cms
2018-01-24,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s new mass-connect Rs 98-a-month 4G plan, seen as a highlight of its second successive cut in effective rates in two weeks, is likely to cause another round of market disruption and more revenue erosion for incumbents Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, analysts said.Brokerage JP Morgan said Jio’s Rs 98/month plan – offering 2GB of data with a 28-days validity span -- “could really hurt incumbents”, as it is aimed squarely “at attracting the next layer of 4G data subscribers”.This plan, the brokerage said, “would cause another round of ARPU (average revenue per user) downgrades in the industry for plans catering to entry-level data subscribers”, adding that Jio’s strategy in the immediate term appears to be cornering “a mass segment of incumbents’ price sensitive voice/non-data subscribers on to its Rs 98/month plan, which is its most affordable 4G plan, in step with its rapid market share expansion ambitions.Credit Suisse said Jio’s Rs 98 plan could become “a meaningful catch all plan” that would drag down ARPU for most high-end smartphone users to just Rs 83,” causing further revenue losses and financial pain to incumbents in the coming quarters.Late on Tuesday, Jio revised its tariff plans for a second time in as many weeks, effective January 26, saying it was bettering bitter rival Bharti Airtel's recent offers.On Wednesday, Bharti Airtel's shares fell 6.51% to close at Rs 458.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, while Idea’s dropped 5.38% to close at Rs 94.05.The telecom sector, already plagued by brutal price competition and debt of Rs 5 lakh-crore, has had another poor quarter. Jio’s latest tariff cuts are likely to further drag ARPU – a key performance metric -- by another 20-30% in the coming quarters.Unlike Jio, which clocked in a strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the December quarter, Airtel and Idea’s fell to Rs 123 and Rs 114, respectively, stung by the cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC), which compounded pressures on their voice and data businesses amid continuing price wars.Morgan Stanley said Jio’s new plan could trigger “churn of low-end 4G data users from incumbent carriers to Jio, or tariff down-trending” if Airtel, Vodafone and Idea match the tariff.“A 10% churn of Airtel’s low-end 4G data subscribers could lead to 3% and 8% impact on its India wireless revenue and Ebitda respectively, and a 4% impact on its consolidated Ebitda,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.Alternately, if Airtel matches Jio’s Rs 98/month 4G plan, the US brokerage said the move would lead to “2% and 6% impacts” on the market leader’s India wireless revenue and Ebitda respectively, and “3% on its consolidated Ebitda”.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said Jio’s Rs 98/month tariff plan “looks more as a feature phone offering,” coming as it does when the Mukesh Ambani-led telco’s JioPhone has become the No 1 feature phone brand in the quarter to December by shipments, overthrowing market leader Samsung in the segment for the first time.“With these implied tariff cuts (from Jio), incumbent telcos may not see positive operational leverage, which pushes the recovery story further out and also makes the ARPU improvement story more gradual,” said Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.According to analysts, the fact that Jio also generates much more data traffic on its 4G network than all incumbent carriers combined would only exacerbate the financial blues for the Big 3 of Indian telecom.Swiss brokerage UBS, however, downplayed the potential impact of Jio’s Rs 98/month tariff plan, saying it is likely “to be a niche plan with a limited subscriber base as the data allowance of 2GB is significantly below other plans”.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jios-new-mass-connect-plan-to-further-hurt-incumbents-analysts/articleshow/62640542.cms

2018-01-29,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm is gearing up to harness Internet of Things (IoT), focusing first on enterprises and industries while initiating talks with car manufacturers and consumer durable companies as well, among others, for the consumer segment. The 4G entrant has brought on board Ayush Sharma from Silicon Valley as senior vice president of engineering and technology, to drive the business around IoT and other technologies such as mobile edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence and blockchain.“Jio is looking at these technologies to enable world’s largest programmable network with alternate technologies available,” Sharma said. “It will take at least around a year to enable consumer IoT, but the large focus is on enterprise IoT. We are working on specific use cases.”Sharma has joined the company after working on his own venture, MotoJeannie, in the United States, and has worked for telecom gear makers Huawei and Ericsson, and Cisco in the past in the US. At Jio, Sharma is building a team of engineers to deploy and develop these technologies.“The idea is not just to launch IoT products and solutions for consumer IoT but also for enterprise and industries,” Sharma said, adding that the parent company, Reliance Industries, is looking to use these technologies initially within in-house verticals such as retail and logistics to make them intelligent. For consumer IoT, Jio is working with a variety of technology vendors and bringing car manufacturers, consumer durables and appliances players, among others, on board to build a complete ecosystem, Sharma said. “We are building our own platform with big data strength,” he said.Jio’s 4G network will complement IoT for enterprise and industrial use cases that required bandwidth and latency, he said.The company had recently said that it had started offering enterprise solutions along with fibre-to-the-home on a trial basis in a few locations.It also has a plan to roll out home broadband-powered home automation that will allow users to convert basic electronic products into smart products with the installation of six-seven smart plugs. These smart plugs will allow users to control the entire home with the help of smartphones or tablets.Jio is also planning to launch a complete suite of home surveillance comprising smart camera, smart doorbell, smart lock and chime alarm. All these products can be managed from the user’s mobile devices, ET had earlier reported.The company’s bigger rival, Bharti Airtel, is also planning to enter the home automation or smart home segment with its IoT and machine-to-machine solutions in a move aimed at expanding its revenue base. The home automation segment is in its nascent stages and real application of use cases and processes have just started to crystallise for the industry. According to a study by Zion Market Research, the global smart home market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.5% between 2017 and 2022. The market revenue is expected to grow from $24.10 billion in 2016 to $53.45 billion by 2022.Jio plans to focus on leveraging the open source ecosystem to unlock potential in the telecom sector. Sharma, who was involved in the ONOS project, an open source community hosted by The Linux Foundation, will also be involved in the open source related efforts.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-now-looks-to-disrupt-iot-space-in-india/articleshow/62690233.cms

Security experts warn users to stay away from downloading any such app. Fake apps have traditionally been about mining personal data, but this time the threat could be different. Shomiron Das Gupta, founder of cyber security firm NetMonastery, says that at least some of these apps could be hiding a new kind of malware, which uses the processing power of your phone to mine crypto currencies in the background. The upward curve in cryptocurrency prices through 2017 had triggered huge demand for system resources. While mining the older crypto currencies like Bitcoin would require massive processing power, smaller cryptocurrencies, Das Gupta says, could even make do with mining activities spread over thousands of infected phones.The most downloaded apps with Jio Coin in their name require the user to give permission for finding accounts on the device, finding contacts, sharing precise location access to modify or delete photos and other files, receiving data from the Internet, viewing network connections, running at startup, controlling vibration, providing full network access, and preventing the device from sleeping. That is a long list of potentially dangerous permissions.Security researchers have pointed fingers at Google for letting fake apps fester.

While mining the older crypto currencies like Bitcoin would require massive processing power, smaller cryptocurrencies, Das Gupta says, could even make do with mining activities spread over thousands of infected phones.The most downloaded apps with Jio Coin in their name require the user to give permission for finding accounts on the device, finding contacts, sharing precise location access to modify or delete photos and other files, receiving data from the Internet, viewing network connections, running at startup, controlling vibration, providing full network access, and preventing the device from sleeping. That is a long list of potentially dangerous permissions.Security researchers have pointed fingers at Google for letting fake apps fester. Unlike Apple’s App Store that allows apps to be listed only after a stringent verification process, Google’s more open Play Store allows developers to list apps easily. While developers can apply for verification, this process can take time and is not mandatory.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/reliance-jio-coin-at-least-22-fake-apps-on-play-store/articleshow/62695209.cms
2018-01-29,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio’s Rs 49 per month offer to JioPhone users could force the top three telecom operators — Airtel, Vodafone and Idea — to switch off their 2G legacy networks and shift to more cost-efficient VoLTE-based 4G networks to protect their rapidly falling average revenue per user (ARPU), analysts said.They said that the latest JioPhone offer — the sector’s lowest price plan offering free voice for life and a GB of data at 4G speeds over a 28-day validity period — is likely to attract many more low-end 2G voice customers across India who have so far hesitated to adopt 4G.Brokerage JP Morgan said the offer “would draw 2G voice subscribers” away from Airtel, Vodafone and Idea as “Jio’s feature phone pricing is as much as 30-50 per cent cheaper than incumbents’ rates”.This is expected to cause more financial pain to incumbents as it comes on the heels of Jio’s equally aggressive Rs 98 per month 4G entry-level price plan that is already estimated to shave off ARPU, a critical performance metric, of incumbent telcos by up to a third in the coming quarters.The 2G feature phone user segment, the US brokerage said, constitutes a whopping 70 per cent of India’s billion-plus mobile user base garnering as much as 50 per cent of sector revenues.According to data collated by the telecom regulator, the ARPU of prepaid users is Rs 70, of which the voice ARPU of feature phone users is in the Rs 50-60 range.Brokerage Motilal Oswal said “the latest JioPhone price plan would be at nearly 10 per cent discount to the average feature phone subscriber ARPU”.The telecom sector, already plagued by brutal price competition and debt of Rs 5 lakh-crore, has had another poor quarter. Unlike Jio, which reported a strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the quarter to December, Airtel and Idea’s fell to Rs 123 and Rs 114 respectively, stung by the cut in interconnect rates, which compounded pressure on their voice and data businesses amid continuing price wars.Kotak Securities said Jio’s latest pricing moves targeting millions of 2G feature phone customers of incumbent carriers would further damage the latter’s already weak financials, forcing them to take tough calls like shutting down their 2G and 3G networks ahead of current plans and rolling out VoLTE-based 4G networks on a war footing.“We wonder if there is an economic case anymore for incumbents to keep their 2G networks running if the JioPhone even sees modest success,” Kotak said, adding that “the ultra-expensive 900 MHz spectrum that incumbents are using for 2G would fail the impairment test as 2G spectrum”, especially since the steep cut in mobile termination charges has “anyways killed the incoming ARPU leg of 2G network economics”.According to Kotak, Jio’s aggressive Rs 49 price point also suggests “Jio has ironed out all supply-related constraints on the JioPhone”, a view also endorsed by Deutsche Bank.The German investment bank said Jio had indicated at a recent analyst meet that it had “worked with its Chinese vendors to build inventory prior to the current JioPhone offer”, although “the price plan is lower than expected”.The JioPhone, which was launched by Jio’s sister company, Reliance Retail, comes for a Rs 1,500 deposit, refundable after three years on return of the device. To avail themselves of the refund, subscribers need to recharge for a minimum Rs 1,500 a year.Under the new plan, JioPhone users would need to top up the minimum monthly charge of Rs 49 with additional sums to reach the Rs 1,500 annual recharge figure, if they wish to avail themselves of the full refund. Part refunds are also allowed for those surrendering the device earlier.Sector experts expect the latest price move to intensify competition with incumbents who are already dishing out cashback offers on their alliances with smartphones. Recently Idea, Vodafone and Airtel announced cashback offers on their 4G smartphones, bringing down the effective price of the devices to under Rs 1,000.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jios-rs-49-per-month-offer-may-force-airtel-vodafone-and-idea-to-shift-to-volte-based-4g/articleshow/62685940.cms

2018-01-31,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm has warned that it could take legal action against those misguiding the public in the name of the company by soliciting investments in crypto currencies through fake JioCoin Apps, and said it doesn’t offer any such apps.In a statement Wednesday, Jio said it has come across media reports and other websites about the existence of purported JioCoin apps on the Internet that are soliciting investments in crypto currencies.“Any such apps using the JioCoin name are fake and people are advised to refrain from dealing with any of them. Reliance Jio takes a serious note of such fraudulent attempts by unscrupulous persons to misguide the public in the name of Jio and reserves the right to take appropriate legal recourse,” the new telco said.Et had reported in its January 30 edition about the existence of fake websites peddling Jio Coin, a crypto currency reportedly in the works from Reliance Industries. As on that date, there were at least 22 apps which had Jio Coin in their name available for download on the Play Store. They ranged from Jio Coin, to Jio Coin Buy and Jio Coin Crypto Currency. While most of these apps had fewer than 1,000 downloads, there were three which had been downloaded between 1,000 and 5,000 times and two which had been downloaded between 10,000 and 50,000 times.

2018-01-31,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular may seek to compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm’s Rs 49 per month offer by unveiling attractively priced tariff plans with some data bundled in to keep the new telecom operator from cornering millions of their 2G feature phone users.“There is always a possibility of coming up with a similar bundled plan or something even more compelling than the Rs 49 JioPhone offer to hold on to our significant feature phone user base,” a senior executive of one of the top three telecom operators told ET on condition of anonymity, without specifying a time frame.Feature, or basic, phone subscribers using mainly voice on 2G account for 65-70% of India’s billion-plus mobile user base and 50% of sector revenues, thereby making it critical for India’s older operators to prevent migration to the new entrant, according to analysts.Jio’s Rs 49 a month offer – the sector’s lowest price plan offering free voice for life and a GB of data at 4G speeds over a 28-day validity span – could help the newest mobile carrier eat into the feature phone user base of incumbents who currently dominate the 2G market, unless they come up with aggressive matching offers quickly.Swiss brokerage UBS said it “would not be surprised if incumbents respond to Jio’s price plans, albeit at a 10-30% premium”.Goldman Sachs said a likely response by incumbents to Jio’s new feature phone plan could be bundled offerings at similar price points, but in tie-ups with handset vendors.Brokerage CLSA, however, said incumbents run the risk of taking “a 10% hit on ARPU (average revenue per user) and revenue” if they retaliate and match Jio’s offer. Idea, with higher operating and financial leverage, would be “at a greater risk”, it said.ET’s queries to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular on whether they would match Jio’s Rs 49 per month offer did not elicit any responses till late evening on Wednesday.The telecom sector, already plagued by brutal price competition and debt upwards of Rs 5 lakh-crore, recently had another poor quarter. Unlike Jio, which reported a strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the quarter to December, Airtel and Idea’s fell to Rs 123 and Rs 114 respectively, stung by the cut in interconnect rates, which compounded pressure on their strained voice and data businesses amid continuing price wars.Jio compounded worries about a prolonged price battle after it recently cut rates twice in quick succession, including the Rs 49 a month for the users of JioPhone, the 4G VoLTE feature phone.In the interim, another option for the incumbents would be to discontinue their unlimited validity plans on the prepaid services platform to contain potential ARPU losses triggered by Jio’s latest offer.At present, about 30% of the country’s mobile phone subscribers (roughly 300 million) are estimated to be on unlimited validity plans that generate monthly ARPU of as little as Rs 25.Brokerage CLSA said incumbents could “mitigate the risk of ARPU fall by 50% by putting an end to their unlimited validity prepaid plans”, which would force a subscriber to recharge each month and thus increase his or her monthly spending and nearly double revenue flow on such plans.Nitin Soni, director at global rating agency, Fitch, however, downplayed the risk to incumbents, saying, “It remains to seen how many existing 2G users actually opt for the new JioPhone offer as the 4G data experience on a small-screen feature phone will be very limited.”Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said the Rs 1,500 initial deposit for the JioPhone is a likely put-off for many customers.The JioPhone, which was launched by Jio’s sister company, Reliance Retail, comes for a Rs 1,500 deposit, refundable after three years on return of the device. To avail themselves of the refund, customers need to recharge for a minimum Rs 1,500 a year.Under the new plan, JioPhone users would need to top up the minimum monthly charge of Rs 49 with additional sums to reach the Rs 1,500 annual recharge figure, if they wish to avail themselves of a full refund.

2018-02-06,"KOLKATA: Increasing import duty on toys and artificial jewellery will do little to cut the country’s dependence on Chinese imports in these sectors, according to domestic players, who say the government should instead raise the local industry’s ability to compete better.The Budget has proposed to increase Customs duty on toys and artificial jewellery to 20%. Domestic manufacturers say that dependence on Chinese-made toys and costume jewellery cannot be brought down immediately because of their lower prices and Indian units’ inability to match their products due to poor infrastructure. “The increase in import duty will not help the Indian manufacturers immediately. At the retail level, Chinese toys enjoy 80% shelf space,” Manish Kukreja, president of All-India Toy Manufacturers Association, told ET. “This matrix cannot change within a very short span of time. What the government can do is keep stricter watch on entry of Chinese toys through illegal routes.” The Indian toy industry is worth about Rs 9,500 crore.“The government has to take a holistic approach and ensure price stability in raw material for helping the domestic toy industry,” said Kukreja. “Cost of power in India has gone up by 55% in the last five to seven years, whereas it has gone down by 19% in China. Labour cost is also high in India. If we have to compete with Chinese toys, we need to bring down our cost.”Ishmeet Singh, country manager-India, Mattel Inc, said, “As per Budget 2018, there has been a substantial increase in Customs duty to 20% for toys and sports goods. This, combined with the other policy changes that have been implemented over the last six months—which include higher rates of taxes under goods & services tax (GST) and strict import regulations-—will result in an overall increase in the price of toys by 20%.”Electric toys attract 18% GST against the earlier 12% value-added tax (VAT) while other toys attract 12% GST versus 5% VAT earlier.While Chinese toys have nudged out locally manufactured ones in retail stores, cheap artificial jewellery from China has also flooded the costume jewellery market, estimated to be worth about Rs 13,000 crore. The trend is supported by the rising price of gold which pushes buyers towards these items.Import duty on artificial jewellery has been increased from 15% to 20%. “We cannot bring down our dependence on costume jewellery from China. They have now become part of our system,” said Rajesh Chheda, a leading costume jeweller from south Mumbai. “There are customers who want those jewellery and we cannot lose them. Prices will definitely go up by 15% -20% from April. The increase in import duty comes at a time when the market sentiment is not very upbeat and movement of goods is slow.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/higher-duty-on-toys-wont-cut-reliance-on-chinese-imports/articleshow/62799498.cms

2018-02-06,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has slammed Reliance Communications (RCom) for trying to ‘pocket’ the unspent pre-paid balances and security deposits of its mobile subscribers after shutting down its wireless operations, and warned of action if the telco failed to refund users’ money.“We have responded to them (RCom), saying either you refund or face action,” Trai Chairman RS Sharma told ET. “They don’t have any moral, ethical or legal basis to say that they can’t refund the money.”Sharma said that a back-ofthe-envelope calculation shows that RCom has some 50 million customers. “And if there is an average ?30 balance for each customer, they (RCom) will be enriched by ?150 crore. RCom will have to refund,” Sharma said.RCom didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.Trai issued a notice last month to Anil Ambani-owned RCom and its unit, Reliance Telecom, to refund the unused balance of the telco’s prepaid customers and security deposit of the post-paid subscribers by January 31. This, after RCom said it was shutting its wireless operations.RCom responded by asking Trai to withdraw its directive and cited mobile number portability (MNP) rules to argue its case that it is not required to give the money back. The company added that it wasn’t sure under what provisions the regulator had asked RCom to refund the money. The telco wrote a follow-up letter, pointing out that there was no precedent of customer refunds in other cases of operators closing down services in the country.“This is ridiculous. On the one hand, in a way, RCom has left the customer high and dry, and now it has the audacity to say it will not refund the money,” Sharma said, adding that the regulator has received thousands of customer complaints.“We have given directions under the relevant provisions of the Trai Act. We have powers to give directions to RCom,” he added.Further, Sharma said that MNP rules are made for normal situations when customers have the option of shifting between two operational operators.“What is happening today is a very exceptional situation. In a normal MNP case, I typically exhaust all my balance before I port out because I know I won’t get a refund. But in this situation, the operator (RCom) has shut down services, so the consumer doesn’t have the opportunity to exhaust the balance. Therefore, this is a very abnormal situation,” Sharma explained.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/trai-slams-reliance-communications-for-refusing-to-refund-consumers-balance/articleshow/62808703.cms
2018-02-07,"By Bhuma Shrivastava and Saket SundriaReliance Jio Infocomm’s first-ever net income is “a bit too good to believe” for Sanford C. Bernstein analysts, who examined how the phone carrier accounts for some costs.Jio’s “unique approach” results in a slower pace of recognizing depreciation and amortization, which led to a 12 billion rupee ($187 million) charge in the December quarter, according to a Feb. 2 Bernstein report. Using a rate similar to local rivals would have quadrupled that number and turned Jio’s reported profit into a loss of Rs 2,410 crore, analysts led by Hong Kong-based Chris Lane estimated.The carrier, controlled by India’s richest man and a unit of Reliance Industries, posted a net income of Rs 504 crore last quarter, about 16 months after its debut sparked an industry price war that crashed revenues. The result was boosted by Jio’s policy, linking depreciation charges to “its own assessment” of usage and economic benefit, while other Indian carriers amortize telecom assets at a fixed rate over time, Morgan Stanley said in a Jan. 21 report.An email seeking comment from Jio’s spokesman went unanswered.“It’s part of accounts engineering. The assets will depreciate over time whether you use them or not, whether you use them partially or fully,” said Anil Singhvi, founder of Ican Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd. This approach is “just a way of saying I’m profitable sooner,” he said by phone, adding that the focus should instead be on cash flows.Reliance shares traded 0.5 per cent higher at 896.45 rupees at 1:14 p.m. in Mumbai while the benchmark Sensex was little changed.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom unit launched with free services in 2016 and went paid 10 months ago. Morgan Stanley estimates Jio will turn cash-flow positive in the 12 months through March 2020.Bernstein analysts pinned Jio’s profit down to three factors: lower network costs possibly due to favorable tower-sharing deals, reduced interconnect fees and its method of accounting for depreciation which “stands out as an anomaly” when compared to global peers.Jio, which had 152 million subscribers at the end of November, has elbowed aside rivals to become the nation’s No. 4 wireless carrier. Bharti Airtel Ltd. is in the top spot with soon-to-be-merged Vodafone India Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd. at No. 2 and No. 3 respectively.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/worlds-top-investment-research-firm-finds-reliance-jios-first-profit-too-good-to-believe/articleshow/62817626.cms

2018-02-08,"NEW DELHI: India’s oil refining capacity is set to jump 80%, or by 194 mt (mt), by 2030 as state refiners, Reliance Industries and Rosneft line up expansion plans, undeterred by the renewables explosion, hoping to meet future demand.Refiners may be able to process 439 mt of oil per annum by 2030, from 245 mt currently, according to a report prepared by a panel comprising oil ministry officials and top state and private refiners’ executives, which studied multiple scenarios to assess demand and refining capacity equirement by 2040.RIL plans to add 30 mt of refining capacity, a 50% increase, by 2030 and Essar Refinery, now controlled by Russian giant Rosneft, is targeting to more than double capacity by adding 25 mt by 2025, according to the unpublished oil ministry report.State-owned Indian Oil Corp. plans to add 36 mt to its current capacity of 81mt.The projections are based on “firm plans and projects already conceptualised and accepted in principle till year 2030 only,” the report said. Expansion plans beyond 2030 are not available. Refining capacity is expected to reach 259 mt by 2020 and 415 mt by 2025.“India provides huge growth opportunity in hydrocarbon sector, especially in downstream business. We are constantly evaluating options for growth,” a spokesperson for Essar Oil said. “However, we are unable to comment on any specifics at this stage.”RIL did not respond to ET’s query on expansion plans.Planned refining capacity will be higher than the 363 mt needed to meet domestic requirements in 2030. Domestic consumption will rise to 443 mt in 2035 and 533 mt by 2040.The proposed addition includes plant expansion and debottlenecking as well as new projects. A 60-mt refinery planned in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra jointly by Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum is the biggest new project. HPCL is planning a 9 mt new refinery at Barmer.If all the new capacity comes online by 2030, Indian Oil will still be the biggest refiner with a total of 116 mt.ET View: Boost Renewable EnergyThe projections suggest that the demand for conventional fuels would keep rising in the medium-term and well beyond. The energy economy is indeed large and growing. There’s huge scope to boost new, renewable and alternative sources of energy. But it seems likely that even as the latter segment grows by leaps and bounds, the former conventional energy sector would stay relevant for years, perhaps decades. Hence the need for proactive policy and attendant resource allocation to fast-forward the expected transition in the energy system.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/state-refiners-ril-and-rosneft-plan-expansion/articleshow/62829227.cms

2018-02-12,"MUMBAI: The Competition Commission of India has given approval for the proposed 100% sale of Reliance Infrastructure’s integrated Mumbai power business to Adani Transmission, the Anil Ambani-led company said in a statement Monday.In December, Gautam Adani-led Adani Transmission has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure’s power generation and distribution business in Mumbai in a deal valued at Rs 13,251 crore. While there will be an upfront payment of Rs 13,251 crore, Reliance Infrastructure will also get regulatory assets under approval estimated at Rs 5,000 crore and net working capital on closing estimated at Rs 550 crore, making the total consideration around Rs 18,800 crore.Transaction is expected to be completed by March 2018.“Reliance Infra will utilize the proceeds of this transformative transaction entirely to reduce its debt. This monetization is a major step in RInfra’s deleveraging strategy for future growth. RInfra will focus on upcoming opportunities in asset light EPC and Defence businesses,” Reliance Infra said. The transactions entails transfer of a 500 mw power plant based in Dahanu in Mumbai, license for power distribution in the city and related infrastructure.The Mumbai distribution circle of Reliance Infrastructure caters to around three million customers, with a total requirement of 1,892 mw of power, of which 500 mw is sourced from its own power plant.In 2015, Reliance Infrastructure had signed a pact to sell 49% stake in it Mumbai electricity business to the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments) of Canada but the deal fell through.

Since I am switching from one mutual fund to another mutual fund can I invest a lumpsum or should I go through the SIP route? I want to redeem Rs 20 lakh from HDFC Balanced fund and invest it in Reliance Small Cap Fund.--Ravi PandeyYou have not mentioned why you want to shift from HDFC Balanced Fund to Reliance Small Cap Fund. Balanced funds are typically recommended to investors who do not want to take much risk, whereas smallcap funds are meant for investors with very high risk tolerance level.Do you have the required risk appetite to invest in a smallcap scheme? Only if you can stomach high risk and withstand extreme volatility, you should consider investing in smallcap schemes. Since they invest in very small companies, they can go through volatile phases. Also, you should be prepared to hold your investments for at least 10 years to make higher returns from them.You have not mentioned how long you have been investing in HDFC Balanced Funds. If you have been in it for a very long time, you may redeem it and invest a lumpsum in your next fund.

2018-02-15,"Essar Oil has sold its entire production of coal-seam gas or CBM from a West Bengal block to state-owned GAIL India Ltd using the same formula that Reliance Industries used for pricing of its CBM.GAIL will buy 2.3 million standard cubic metres per day of coal-bed methane (CBM) that Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (EOGEPL) will produce from its Raniganj block in West Bengal for USD 7.1 per million British thermal unit.According to an evaluation of bid posted by Essar on its website, GAIL outbid Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, Graphite India Ltd and Positron Energy Pvt Ltd to bag the supplies.The price is more than double of the USD 2.89 per mmBtu price set by the government for most of the domestically produced conventional natural gas.Essar used the same formula which Reliance Industries had first used in 2012 to seek bids for its CBM gas from its Sohgpur block in Madhya Pradesh, and then again last year for selling the CBM. In the first instance, the oil ministry had not approved the price.Like RIL, Essar had sought bids for potential users in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document.GAIL bid a deductible of 1.89, which translated into a gas price of USD 7.12 per mmBtu (on gross calorific value) at today's Brent oil price of USD 64.80. At three-month Brent crude average of USD 65.8, the gas price comes to USD 7.23 on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.Interestingly, GAIL had in the similar bid process run by RIL last year for 3 million standard cubic metres per day of Sohagpur CBM gas quoted a deductible of 3.495. RIL had bid a deductible of 1.836 to win all the supplies.RIL's Sohagpur gas at today's oil price comes to USD 7.15 per mmBtu on GCV basis.The formula used by RIL and Essar is the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to import long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.EOGEPL had invited bids from prospective buyers of gas based on a government notification dated April 11, 2017, which lays out a policy framework for the early monetisation of CBM gas.The policy provided marketing and pricing freedom at arm's length price in the domestic market to contractors of CBM blocks.EOGEPL has invested about Rs 4,000 crore in the Raniganj East CBM block in drilling wells, setting up supply infrastructure, and laying customer pipelines to Durgapur and nearby industrial areas, according to the company.The block has 348 completed CBM wells, alongside robust gas and water handling capacity.The Raniganj East block is India's most prolific CBM block, which has achieved gas production of more than 1 mmscmd (million standard cubic metres per day), which will be gradually scaled up a saleable volume to 2.3 mmscmd.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/essar-sells-raniganj-cbm-block-to-gail-using-reliance-formula/articleshow/62934615.cms

2018-02-19,"Talking to ET Now, Sanjay Parekh, Reliance Mutual Fund, says RBI’s guidelines for recognising asset quality pain via upfront provisioning getting higher coverage, augurs well for the banking system in the long term.Edited excerpts:Let us first start with what is happening in the banking space. There is a huge fraud which has been discovered in PNB and which could have repercussions for the entire sector per se. What do you think this kind of news will do to PSBs at large and PNB in general? We may not be able to comment on a specific stock but broadly of course this is a headwind. But, we believe that this should not spiral and it would not be pervasive. Essentially, if you read this with the RBI guideline, around Rs 8 lakh crore was gross NPA and another Rs 4 lakh crore was through RBI dispensation or SMA-2 or watch list. What RBI guideline said was that you accelerate recognition of NPA, do accelerated provisioning and that would mean higher credit cost for banks which have higher stress and ROA and ROE. This event is of course a dampener but we really believe that the Rs 80 lakh crore credit is not small and markets would see through it. What will follow after that is of course the accelerated recognition to NPA. If the resolutions are in place, then they will move into insolvency proceedings and whether we have bandwidth there has to be seen. But very clearly, we will see accelerated recognition of NPA, accelerated provisioning, higher credit cost and hence less ROA for fourth quarter for sure and of course for FY19. Just when it appeared that PSU banks had recognised all the bad loans, they had swallowed the bitter pill, the books were cleaned up and then they were on road to recovery, an accounting fraud has been discovered. So, for an investor, do you think the messaging is very simple that PSU banks may be cheap but they deserve to be cheap because of poor standards?Yes, there will be surely flight to quality. We have seen this time and again in banks the world over. If you remember, the European banks crisis or even the US crisis in 2008, whenever the sanctity of book is in question, they get derated very much. But when the sanctity of book is restored, there is re-rating and what RBI is doing is getting more sanctity of the book being written which is very good in the long term. In newer terms, such instances do have ramification on specific banks and the overall segment as well. But we believe in the clear larger names -- PNB itself was a very large bank -- but other than that, certainly you need to be top of the line in PSU banks and the smaller ones will have issues on credit quality, on credit cost and definitely in the interim phase they will have challenges.I do not want you to comment on individual stocks but Tata Steel outbid on Bhushan Steel and offered cash of nearly Rs 35,000 crore and 12% equity to creditors. Bankers may have to take a good 27% to 30% haircut. What is your own view on this entire resolution and whether or not the banking sector which in any case is just dealing and grappling with so many NPA issues, can take a such a large hit in light of this resolution?You rightly said that the good part is we have got encouraging bids for a few of the steel assets but we still have the rest of the bids to come and in some of the segments, the bids may not be very encouraging. We will have to see in toto and then we have another 28 companies and then the ones which we expect around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which is either in RBI dispensation which can move 180 days after 1st March or if there is no resolution to IBC. So, we are going to have around 5 lakh crores of cases in IBC and we will have to see the resolution. There is a lot of supply of assets. The promoters rightly cannot participate. There is enough private equity money for the right assets but certainly they would have their threshold of returns and in certain segments, you will see fewer takers and the process is going to take a little longer. While there is lot of good work happening in terms of NCLT codes, the government, the RBI, the bankers, the insolvency professionals, this is a time-consuming process. We will have to be patient. It will be gradual. You have seen some very good bids which is encouraging for the banks because the haircuts would be less, but we will have to watch more of them coming through which is particularly in power we think that the haircuts will be larger than what we have seen in metals. Metal has been certainly a good case.Besides Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel as well as Electrosteel, they have also seen very high interest from investors. Do you see steel sector haircuts to be contained at sub-50%. What would this mean for PSU banks and corporate banks in particular like an ICICI Bank as well as Axis because they too in the same vein have been falling like nine pins all of last week?This is a tailwind. In steel assets particularly, there will be less haircuts and that would mean write-backs in certain cases. In one of the cement companies, the bids have been very encouraging and that is very good. All this put together, around Rs 1.2-1.5 lakh crores assets are being bid quite well. But, for the rest of them, we have to see what is the response, what are the haircuts, whether some of them can go into liquidation and what is the response to those assets.This is very clearly quite encouraging and while we have had this case of fraud which we think is an isolated case, there is clear tailwind in the better bid for Bhushan Steel and we will also see hopefully in Bhushan Power. We have seen that in Binani and I am very sure it will be the same in Essar because all the steel assets are running quite well right now.Also, they are doing quite well and once the transfer happens, they will actually start paying interest at a point on the revised structure. There are encouraging signals but the verdict is yet not out that is what I would say.HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI are your top holdings. Wonder why there is no IndusInd Bank in the list.As you would have referred my fax sheet, we have owned Bharat Finance which is going to be in the process of merger into IndusInd Bank. Without getting into names, we like the private banks which have a retail presence, less asset quality issues and in a calibrated manner, we like the large corporate banks which have its pain but we think that in 2019-20 they would look quite good. Having said that, large corporate banks will also have their share of pain in the fourth quarter of this year and in FY19. But the franchise they have on the retail side -- both the asset and liability side -- are very strong and that is getting underappreciated and the size of the balance sheet is large for them. They are all adequately capitalised. They are not in dire need of capital.As I said, the retail piece is doing quite well and they can move into better ROAs and ROEs in FY20 shortly. We believe that despite this headwind and as per RBI guidelines, it is actually very good over a long term. I believe that in FY20 and in the next 10 years, these guidelines will actually be a blessing for the banking sector. When you do a surgery, there is pain but it is very good for the patient in the long term.

2018-02-20,"NEW DELHI: India’s older carriers have slammed the telecom regulator for a series of regulations over the last 12-18 months which favour only new entrant Reliance Jio at the cost of the existing ones, and said the latest tariff order on predatory pricing violated the ‘fundamental right’ of incumbents to carry out business.In a statement Tuesday, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) called on the government to urgently intervene, saying that regulations and policies that were not based on fair play would further aggravate the financial stress in the industry, kill future investments and leave thousands of jobs at stake.“For some reason these orders seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators…regulation after regulation put out by TRAI has ended up in distorting the competitive landscape in favour of one operator, while putting all other operators at a serious disadvantage,” COAI said.The body, which represents all major operators in India including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Jio, said the Mukesh Ambani-owned new telco – which started operations in September 2016 and triggered a price war which had hurt the revenue and profitability of India’s existing telcos - didn’t subscribe to these views.Rajan told ET that COAI members, except for Jio, will decide over the next few days whether to move court against Trai’s amendment to the Telecom Tariff Order (TTO). The regulator couldn’t be reached for comment while Jio didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.Friday, Trai amended its tariff order, saying predatory pricing henceforth will be determined on the basis of average variable cost and whether there is specific intention on the part of a carrier to reduce or kill competition. It also changed the definition of significant market power (SMP), which a telco needs to have for any of its plans to be deemed predatory, to an operator with more than a 30% share by either subscriber base or gross revenue. Earlier, the SMP parameters included volume of traffic, including data, and switching capacity.In a note to clients, brokerage BNP Paribas said the tariff order “restricts predatory pricing by players with more than 30% subscriber/revenue market share (read:Bharti Airtel, Idea-Vodafone combine) but puts no restrictions on promotions of Jio, which is the dominant player in data with four times more volumes than Bharti or Idea-Vodafone”.COAI’s Rajan said after the changed SMP parameters, “victims have now been made the perpetrators…one operator (read: Jio) who by its own admission is the world’s largest data network may be free to offer any sort of predatory tariffs while older operators are now subject to regulation and cannot compete without falling foul of a new definition of what constitutes predatory pricing.”It also noted that Trai’s latest tariff order that mandated telcos to do away with segregated offers or those provided to retain subscribers “in the garb of transparency and non-discrimination”, took away to a large extent the older operators’ flexibility to counter any subscriber poaching attempt.“In effect, older operators will now be challenged on the basis of revised definition of SMP so as to be prevented from responding to what may be actual ‘predatory tariff plans’. Even more strangely, they will find it practically difficult to offer any discounts/provide benefits to retain their customers if a competitor chooses to poach them, effectively taking away their ability to compete and conduct business,” COAI said, adding this violated the fundamental right to carry out “any occupation, trade or business as enshrined in Article 14 and 19(1) (g)” of the incumbent operators.The body accused Trai of going against the views of all private telcos, except for Jio, on allowing discounted/customized offerings to customers, and accepting the suggestions of only the new entrant.“In fact, it appears the Trai has copy pasted the demands of this one operator across a range of definitions in the new TTO,” COAI said, and gave examples of its claims.COAI said that the industry, which was already reeling from the “regressive regulations” such as cuts in Mobile Termination Rates – which cost incumbent operators over Rs15000 crore a year and benefited Jio by nearly Rs10,000 crore rupees – and in International termination charge, which lowered forex revenue to the government by Rs2000 crore rupees, has now been dealt a “near fatal body blow with the recent amendment to Telecom Tariff Order (TTO).”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/coai-slams-trai-for-biased-rules-favouring-reliance-jio/articleshow/63002196.cms

In its notice, the telco said it is within its rights to take COAI and the three top incumbents to court , seeking damages . ""COAI and Rajan Mathews are hereby called upon to issue a public apology and issue appropriate clarification expressly regretting their callous and defamatory statements through a separate press release issued no later than 48 hours from receipt of this notice,"" said the Ambani owned company in its notice to COAI. The Ambani owned firm has also said that it reserves ""its rights to initiate criminal and civil defamation proceedings, including for damages, against both COAI and incumbent dominant operators (IDOs), jointly and or severally"" . COAI on Tuesday, accused the telecom regulator of issuing a series of regulations over the past 12-18 months, including the latest order on predatory pricing, that allegedly favour Reliance Jio, which started services in September 2016. COAI, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular did not respond to ET's queries on the notice. The notice termed the COAI's comments as"" reckless, wilful and flagrant act of making slanderous and libelous accusations "" against Jio. The latest entrant in the telecom industry demanded that operators' association ""immediately cease and desist from publishing false and defamatory imputations"" against Jio. Jio alleged that COAI used to be the ""official voice of the Indian Telecom Industry"" but has now been reduced ""to becoming an instrument and mouthpiece of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (including Telenor, now controlled by Bharti Airtel)"".Jio alleged the cellular association of scuttling any ""regulatory development aimed towards greater fair market access for new entrants and greater transparency and lowered costs for the consumers"". The Ambani owned operator in its grievances against COAI said that it did not reach out to Jio for its opinion before sending out its release on Tuesday and is being used to put forth the interests of the incumbents at the cost of the industry at large.The notice said the dominant incumbents ""conspired and deliberated on the matter, and instigated the COAI to issue the Press Release with malicious intent to cause harm to the reputation"" of Jio. COAI in its earlier statement had said that Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) tariff order amendments was ""strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of otheroperators. According to Jio, COAI blamed the operator for reforms that will benefit both industry and consumers. The operator with 160 million subscribers said COAI's comments that TRAI'S decision to slash interconnect user charges or definition of predatory pricing would benefit Jio was false and defamatory. Jio also highlighted COAI’s comments on how the latest predatory pricing rules will benefit “one operator”. The crux of the matter in Trai’s latest order is flexibility on pricing given to operators with less than 30% of subscribers and revenue, which top three telcos contend benefits Jio. According to the amended tariff order, predatory pricing would telco’s average variable cost and whether there is specific intent on the part of a carrier to reduce or kill competition. The telecom regulator too has dismissed as “baseless” allegations by India’s top three operators that its recent rulings and policies are biased against them and said the companies are free to move court if they find any anomaly in its orders. Cellular operators have “got into the habit of making allegations that are baseless and lacking in substance,” Telecom Regulatory Authority of India secretary SK Gupta told ET on Wednesday. Jio in its notice said that these rules will apply to all telcos and will not benefit anyone in particular.The telecom industry for the past year and a half has been at loggerheads. Reeling under more than Rs 7 lakh crore of debt and facing a sharp fall in revenue, profitability and free cash flows, forcing many operators to shut down or merge with larger players. Market leader Bharti Airtel has announced its intentions to pick up the wireless business of Tata Teleservices, having earlier bought Telenor India.

2018-02-26,"MUMBAI: Reliance Infrastructure has won an arbitration award of Rs 292 crore against the government of Goa in a case relating to non-payment of dues for electricity supplied by the former, the Anil Ambani-led company said Monday.The matter went into arbitration when Goa state utility delayed payments to Reliance Infrastructure for power supplied from its 48 megawatt-Goa Power Plant in Sancoale.“The tribunal has also ordered payment of interest at 15% per annum on the total award amount if government of Goa fails to pay the entire award amount by the deadline,” the company said.The Arbitration Tribunal, on February 16, ordered the government of Goa to pay Rs 292 crore to Reliance Infrastructure by April 15.

The group said it had raised concerns keeping growth and development of industry in mind.Mathews, on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona over the weekend, ruled out any apologies to the new operator, reiterating that its opinions were not directed to any specific telco.The Ambani owned operator with 160 million subscribers refused to buy the industry body’s reasons. “The attempt on your part and on part of the COAI to belatedly claim that they did not want to aggrieve any particular operator was constituted misplaced attempt to avoid liability, said Jio on Monday.The rift between COAI and Jio started last week when the industry body accused the telecom regulator of issuing a series of regulations over the past 12-18 months, including the latest order on predatory pricing, that allegedly favour the new operator, which started services in September 2016.In its defamation notice sent to COAI and Mathews, Jio had said it is within its rights to take COAI and the three top incumbents to court seeking damages.Again on Monday, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company said COAI had shed any proof, via its statements, that it was acting on behest of the industry and alleged that it was functioning as mouthpiece of dominant telcos-namely Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular.The operator reiterated its opinion and that of Aircel were not included by COAI. It added that COAI's earlier statements that the regulator had “copy pasted the demands of one operator” referred to Jio alone.Earlier, the telecom regulator too had dismissed as “baseless” allegations by India’s top three operators that its recent rulings and policies are biased against them and said the companies are free to move court if they find any anomaly in its orders.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/reliance-jio-again-warns-coai-rajan-mathews-of-legal-action/articleshow/63081562.cms

Only after a nod from the management committee, companies can begin developing these fields. With 60% stake, Reliance is the operator of the KGDWN-98/3, or KGD6 block. BP holds 30% and Niko 10% in the block.Three field development plans approved on Monday relate to MJ and two clusters referred to as satellite fields, according to a BP spokesperson. These three projects are expected to start producing from 2022 and will together have a peak output of around 20 million metric standard cubic meters per day, according to BP.Last June, Reliance and BP had said they planned to pump in $6 billion to produce 30-35 million cubic meters of gas a day phased over 2020-2022. The plan included development of R-series project as well as MJ and satellite fields. The field development plan for R-series has already been approved.Development of these natural gas fields discovered years ago by Reliance was delayed due to lower domestic gas prices. India follows a formula pricing for locally-produced gas, which is linked to international rates but not attractive enough for private investors to deploy their billions.After the government allowed higher prices last year for gas produced from difficult fields such as some of those in the KG Basin, Reliance and BP dusted off their previous plans and submitted investment proposals to the government. The new prices available to gas from difficult fields is more than double that of rates applicable to gas from ordinary fields.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ril-bp-get-panel-nod-for-4-billion-investment-in-kg-basin-dgh/articleshow/63086048.cms

D1 and D2 are the other two fields producing only gas.MA will be the first of the three fields to be shut that initially generated big expectations but began disappointing within years of starting production, creating several controversies and legal disputes on the way.Reliance, the operator of the KGD6 block, has presented the possibility of shutting the MA field by October 2018 in the annual work programme submitted to the government recently, people familiar with the matter said.

2018-03-01,"Flows from small cities and towns where we are focussing a lot are going to be the growth driver, says Sundeep Sikka, ED & CEO, Reliance Nippon Life AM, in an interview with ET Now. Sikka says retail investors are going ahead with SIPs as the taxation is much higher in all alternate avenues of investment like fixed deposits, gold and real estate.Edited excerpts:To begin with, SIPs in Indian mutual funds have hit the magic number of $1 billion. Can you take us through some of the trends that you have observed in the consumer behaviour on the SIP front? Are you seeing any sort of a slowdown in the recent weeks, post the news flows or disappointment with the PSU banks?We are very happy to see that the monthly SIPs have crossed $1-billion-mark and this is just the beginning! We started the year with a monthly industry SIP number of nearly Rs 4,000 crore and the year is not over yet. We are almost at Rs 6,700 crore. One of the interesting trends that we are seeing today is that most SIPs are coming in from smaller cities and towns and today SIP is becoming the first investment vehicle for a lot of Indians. There was a time a few years ago, when it was difficult to convince investors to go for SIPs but today it is becoming the first step to the capital market. Again, over the last 15-16 months, post demonetisation, the flows from small cities and towns have just been increasing. The number of systematic plans from small cities and towns beyond B15 cities is almost equal to the T15 cities. This is a trend which we could never have thought of and as Reliance Nippon Life, we have always have believed that a lot of growth in mutual funds industry will come from small cities and towns. We have been expanding a lot and demonetisation has proved to be a catalyst. SIPs are becoming a part of the monthly wallet and this will keep getting better. As far as the trends are concerned, especially over the last one month, the way we see is that the Indian investors are maturing. We have not seen any slowdown in the new SIP registration in the last one month.Also, the good thing that is happening is unlike in the past all the investors are not going through the same experience. If majority of the money is coming in a month, then markets are not doing well. Last month, markets were down 5%, investors used to panic but at this point of time, about 80,000 crore per annum is coming to systematic investment plans. These investors are not reacting too fast to market volatility.How has the response been in equity and debt flows post the budget raising the LTCG on equity mutual funds and also ULIPs being exempted from flows. I would imagine that LTCG would have put a bit of a breaks on the kind of flows we have seen?It has been four weeks since LTCG was announced. The flows for this month unofficially has not seen any slowdown. The official numbers are yet to be out. Having said that, whenever the markets are turbulent, a lot of investors including HNIs become a little jittery before they invest. But as far as retail investors are concerned, in spite of LTCG, mutual funds remain one of the most attractive products for them. If you look at the alternate avenues -- whether it has to do with fixed deposits, gold, real estate -- the taxation is much higher. So, again, the pulse that we are getting from retail investors and the distributors is there is no major slowdown in flow because of LTCG. Ultimately, we are talking of equities. When you talk of equities whether an investor is getting 18% or 20% does not matter to him as long as he is getting better than fixed deposits. So, the retail investors will not get impacted. The HNIs, however, will get impacted because of the LTCG. But vis-à-vis ULIPs, I have always believed mutual funds are far superior to ULIPs.Insurance is always there for protection but for the investments it has to be mutual funds. If you look at the high cost structure of ULIPs vis-à-vis the low-cost structure or mutual funds, there is no comparison and whether investors are getting educated or not, I do not think high- cost ULIPs can be pushed to the investors. The way I see it, clearly mutual funds have a clear edge over ULIPs.Let us talk about your company. Brokerages are very bullish on the company, post a very strong Q3 performance. You posted a 25% profit growth and a revenue growth of 25% as well, Is this kind of performance sustainable?As a company, our focus has been profitable growth. We have built up a very strong retail franchise. Right now, we are present in 269 locations. We have opened about 100 new locations after the IPO and our focus remains on small ticket size SIPs and profitability. If you were to see YTD for the nine months, effectively the profit and the revenue has grown by 26%, the PAT has grown by 27% and post demonetisation, we see a lot of money which is coming into the banking system is flowing into the mutual fund industry.With our strong brand and franchise, we are in a very strong position to capture the inflows. Just to give you the numbers, post demonetisation, roughly Rs 2 lakh crore of retail money has come into the mutual fund industry and we have got Rs 30,000 crore out of that. Against our market share of 11% post demonetisation, we have got 18% of the retail flows coming into the mutual fund industry. We clearly believe that the strong franchise that we have built up and with the operating leverage which will come into play, clearly, we should be able to sustain the growth rate.Your AUM growth has been at a 1.8% on a sequential basis and 17% year-on-year. What regions and segments are contributing to this high growth and is this number sustainable? Can you even better that going forward?I will take the second part of the question first. At this point of time, less than 2% of the population is investing in mutual funds. Clearly post demonetisation, mutual fund is coming as the best investment avenue. The money coming into the banking system has to flow somewhere; gold is not attractive, real estate is not attractive and fixed deposit rates are no more attractive. This money will flow into the capital markets and mutual fund is going to be the route which is going to be used. For us, retail remains the focus, small cities remain the focus and as you are aware, we have always been talking of India and Bharat separately. Right now, we believe the next biggest driver for the mutual fund industry will be the flows coming from Bharat, from small cities and towns where we are focussing a lot. Going forward, we believe the kind of flows that we have seen, irrespective of the fact whether markets go up by 10% or down by 10%, there is a structural change happening in India. Mutual funds are becoming the first preferred investment avenue. We believe this kind of growth will be possible. However, having said that, capital markets have cyclical nature. While the growth can be plus minus 5-10% in one year or the other, from the next five years’ perspective, we believe a growth of 20-25% is possible.Can you tell us how the margins are in equity and debt AUMs and what is the outlook going forward?Broadly for us, the net margins in equity are about 125 bps. What we charge is 225 bps, the net margin coming to the management fee is 125 bps, in equity and in debt it is about 50-60 bps, money market is about 5 bps. For us, the blended yield of the company is 63 bps and going forward, with the equity proportion increasing, if you see in the last nine months also equity as an AUM which was as a percentage of AUM has increased from 28% to 34%. We believe these kind of margins will continue and not only the margins, the volumes can multiply from here taking into account very low penetration in the mutual fund industry.What are your future organic and inorganic growth plans?We are open to acquisitions. One of the object clauses for the IPO was that we will be looking at acquisitions. As you are aware, last year we had acquired Goldman Sachs India operations. Having said that, we are very conscious of the fact because we are growing organically at a very fast pace and it is far cheaper to grow organically. We will look at acquisitions if it really adds value and comes at the right price. At this point of time, we are adding Rs 7,800 crore of equity assets per annum only through SIPs which are locked in as on date. Clearly, for us, any acquisition that we do in the mutual fund space has to add some value. However, clearly, we will be also looking at opportunities in alternate investment space and other avenues which can complement our business.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/next-big-driver-for-mutual-funds-will-be-flows-from-bharat-sundeep-sikka-reliance-nippon-life-am/articleshow/63124435.cms
2018-03-01,"Flows from small cities and towns where we are focussing a lot are going to be the growth driver, says Sundeep Sikka, ED & CEO, Reliance Nippon Life AM, in an interview with ET Now. Sikka says retail investors are going ahead with SIPs as the taxation is much higher in all alternate avenues of investment like fixed deposits, gold and real estate.Edited excerpts:To begin with, SIPs in Indian mutual funds have hit the magic number of $1 billion. Can you take us through some of the trends that you have observed in the consumer behaviour on the SIP front? Are you seeing any sort of a slowdown in the recent weeks, post the news flows or disappointment with the PSU banks?We are very happy to see that the monthly SIPs have crossed $1-billion-mark and this is just the beginning! We started the year with a monthly industry SIP number of nearly Rs 4,000 crore and the year is not over yet. We are almost at Rs 6,700 crore. One of the interesting trends that we are seeing today is that most SIPs are coming in from smaller cities and towns and today SIP is becoming the first investment vehicle for a lot of Indians. There was a time a few years ago, when it was difficult to convince investors to go for SIPs but today it is becoming the first step to the capital market. Again, over the last 15-16 months, post demonetisation, the flows from small cities and towns have just been increasing. The number of systematic plans from small cities and towns beyond B15 cities is almost equal to the T15 cities. This is a trend which we could never have thought of and as Reliance Nippon Life, we have always have believed that a lot of growth in mutual funds industry will come from small cities and towns. We have been expanding a lot and demonetisation has proved to be a catalyst. SIPs are becoming a part of the monthly wallet and this will keep getting better. As far as the trends are concerned, especially over the last one month, the way we see is that the Indian investors are maturing. We have not seen any slowdown in the new SIP registration in the last one month.Also, the good thing that is happening is unlike in the past all the investors are not going through the same experience. If majority of the money is coming in a month, then markets are not doing well. Last month, markets were down 5%, investors used to panic but at this point of time, about 80,000 crore per annum is coming to systematic investment plans. These investors are not reacting too fast to market volatility.How has the response been in equity and debt flows post the budget raising the LTCG on equity mutual funds and also ULIPs being exempted from flows. I would imagine that LTCG would have put a bit of a breaks on the kind of flows we have seen?It has been four weeks since LTCG was announced. The flows for this month unofficially has not seen any slowdown. The official numbers are yet to be out. Having said that, whenever the markets are turbulent, a lot of investors including HNIs become a little jittery before they invest. But as far as retail investors are concerned, in spite of LTCG, mutual funds remain one of the most attractive products for them. If you look at the alternate avenues -- whether it has to do with fixed deposits, gold, real estate -- the taxation is much higher. So, again, the pulse that we are getting from retail investors and the distributors is there is no major slowdown in flow because of LTCG. Ultimately, we are talking of equities. When you talk of equities whether an investor is getting 18% or 20% does not matter to him as long as he is getting better than fixed deposits. So, the retail investors will not get impacted. The HNIs, however, will get impacted because of the LTCG. But vis-à-vis ULIPs, I have always believed mutual funds are far superior to ULIPs.Insurance is always there for protection but for the investments it has to be mutual funds. If you look at the high cost structure of ULIPs vis-à-vis the low-cost structure or mutual funds, there is no comparison and whether investors are getting educated or not, I do not think high- cost ULIPs can be pushed to the investors. The way I see it, clearly mutual funds have a clear edge over ULIPs.Let us talk about your company. Brokerages are very bullish on the company, post a very strong Q3 performance. You posted a 25% profit growth and a revenue growth of 25% as well, Is this kind of performance sustainable?As a company, our focus has been profitable growth. We have built up a very strong retail franchise. Right now, we are present in 269 locations. We have opened about 100 new locations after the IPO and our focus remains on small ticket size SIPs and profitability.

2018-03-05,"Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure has slapped a Rs 5,440.38-crore arbitration notice on the former promoters of Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering citing breaches of warranties and representations by them at the time of acquisition.The amount claimed by Reliance Infrastructure is more than double of the Rs 2,000 crore it paid for acquisition of Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering in 2015. This acquisition marked Ambani’s foray into the defence sector where he set ambitious targets.The arbitration will be filed pursuant to SIAC, Singapore Rules, the company said. Pipavav Defence’s founder promoters, namely, Nikhil Gandhi, Bhavesh Gandhi, SKIL Infrastructure, Greek Investments and Finance Private and SKIL Shipyard have been listed as the opposing parties.Reliance Infrastructure did not give specific details of the warranties that were breached. The company informed the bourses in India that the litigations were due to “indemnity claims for breach of warranties under the purchase agreements dated March 4, 2015 entered into between the claimant and the founder promoters for acquisition of shares of Pipavav Defence & Engineering (now named Reliance Naval and Engineering).”In 2015, Reliance Infrastructure signed a share purchase agreement with the promoter group to buy 18% stake for Rs 819 crore. Subsequently, the company made an open offer to shareholders of the company and acquired another 26% in the company for around Rs 1,200 crore.“The company has discovered that there have been serious breaches of warranties and representations made by the founder promoters. As per the share purchase agreement we are entitled to claim the loss caused, in an arbitration. The company is convinced of the breaches discovered and is therefore compelled to enforce its rights,” a source close to Reliance Infrastructure said.In August, at Reliance Infrastructure’s annual general meet, Anil Ambani had told shareholders that the acquisition of Pipavav Defence and the subsequent tie-ups with international companies make Reliance Infrastructure one of the two companies in India which are strategically positioned to participate in the government’s programme to build submarines.Post the acquisition, Reliance Infra signed an agreement with Russia’s manufacturer of Air Defence Missile Systems, Almaz-Antey, to work jointly on a range of air defence missile and radar systems for the Indian defence forces.

2018-03-06,"MUMBAI: An arbitration court has “restrained” Reliance Communications (RCom) from selling or transferring assets without its permission, and set June 9 as the date for the next hearing, dealing a blow to the Anil Ambani-owned telco’s efforts to pare debt by March end under a plan driven by its lenders.“We direct the Claimant (RCom)and its affiliates are restrained from transferring, alienating, encumbrance or disposing of any of its assets without specific permission/leave of the Arbitral Tribunal,” the court of arbitration said in an interim order dated March 5.“The respondent (Ericsson) has made an arguable case and the tribunal is of the opinion that in the event it is denied any relief, it will suffer an irretrievable injury,” said Justice Swatanter Kumar, Justice VS Sirpurkar and Justice SB Sinha — all former Supreme Court judges — in their order, a copy of which has been reviewed by ET.A spokesperson for RCom — which is trying to pare its Rs 45,000-crore debt — said the operator will soon move the high court against the order. “We are looking into the matter and will move the Hon’ble High Court to oppose this directive,” the spokesperson said. The order came in an arbitration battle being fought between Ericsson and RCom with the Swedish equipment maker trying to recover its dues worth Rs 1,012 crore.The equipment maker had said that if RCom is allowed to sell or transfer its assets, it would be turned into a shell company and Ericsson wouldn’t be able to get its money back.As things stand, the ruling stalls the company’s planned sale of most of its wireless assets including spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm for over Rs20,000 crore, which was scheduled to be completed by March end. Jio did not respond to am emailed query seeking comment.The funds thus raised would be used to repay RCom’s 35 lenders. But in case RCom can’t repay by end of March, the lenders could take the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016, especially after the central bank scrapped all debt recast schemes.China Development Bank, which accounted for 37% of RCom’s secured debt, had also previously moved NCLT to recover dues worth Rs 11,460 crore, but withdrew it following an understanding with the telco after the Jio deal. Its condition was it could review its position if the money wasn’t repaid.“If RCom has been prevented to sell assets, then they will sure file and appeal in the court which means that the deal to sell assets to Reliance Jio could be delayed,” said a senior banker, asking not to be named.Anil Kher, senior advocate representing Ericsson in this case, claimed the development was a huge victory for the company. “The tribunal has secured our (Ericsson’s) money by passing the order. We have also filed a separate claim for Rs 1,600 crore that RCom owes as of October 11, 2017 with arbitral tribunal,” said Kher. He added that the Rs 1,012 crore was due till March, 2017, which has grown to Rs1,600 crore now, necessitating a separate claim from Ericsson. Ericsson has also separately moved NCLT to recover its dues from RCom, the hearing for which is due on March 9.RCom had late December just managed to avoid the possibility of ceding control to banks under a strategic debt restructuring programme, with the proposed sale of assets to Jio. After the sale to Jio, RCom exited the debt recast process. But the latest order puts a cloud on the sale process. The latest order said that substantial part of dues claimed by Ericsson have been “unequivocally admitted” to by RCom and transfer of assets, if allowed at this stage, would “render award passed by Tribunal in favour of respondent redundant”.RCom, prior and even during proceedings, had intended to delay the process and the “respondents will not be able to enjoy the fruits of decree if passed in their favour,” the order copy added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/arbitration-court-bars-reliance-communications-from-selling-or-transferring-assets/articleshow/63179620.cms

As things stand, the arbitration court ruling stalls the company’s planned sale of most of its wireless assets including spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes to Jio for over Rs20,000 crore, which was scheduled to be completed by March end.The funds thus raised would be used to repay RCom’s 35 lenders. But in case RCom can’t repay by end of March, the lenders could take the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016, especially after the central bank scrapped all debt recasts.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-communications-moves-bombay-hc-against-arbitration-court-order-barring-sale-of-assets/articleshow/63193044.cms
2018-03-08,"MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal stayed till March 13 the sale of assets of Reliance Infratel, the tower unit of Reliance Communications, the second setback this week for the Anil Ambani-owned telco that is rushing to pare debt by half by March end.The injunction by BSV Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy of the Mumbai bench of the NCLT on Wednesday came after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius), a minority shareholder in the tower company, argued that its consent was not sought for the asset sale and, if allowed, would be an “oppression of a minority shareholder under section 397 and 398” as Reliance Infratel would become defunct.The tribunal has reserved the order for March 12.According to legal sources, the RCom subsidiary may appeal against the stay order in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The telco did not respond to ET’s queries.“Consent was not asked. My company (Reliance Infratel) was profitable. Why are all assets of my company sold and only selective assets of RCom sold? Why should I go defunct? You cannot benefit yourself while I am wiped out,” argued senior counsel Iqbal Chagla, representing HSBC Daisy Investments, which owns about 5% in Reliance Infratel.This is the second hurdle for RCom in its attempt to cut Rs 45,000 crore of debt. An arbitration tribunal in a legal battle with Swedish equipment provider Ericsson stalled RCom’s asset sale plan on Monday. RCom is on the verge of selling most of its wireless assets to Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm for about Rs 25,000 crore, although both companies haven’t officially commented on the deal figure.Alpana Ghone, senior counsel representing Reliance Infratel, said the planned transaction includes Rs 8,000 crore for its tower and fibre assets, of which Rs 5,000 crore would be for the towers and land alone. Alternative asset manager Brookfield was set to pay Rs 11,000 crore for the towers before the deal was called off following the scrapping of RCom’s merger with Aircel.The HSBC counsel demanded more details, which Anil Ambani’s counsel refused to divulge.The court proceedings revealed that Bharti Airtel was the second-highest bidder for the tower assets with an offer that was 25% lower than Jio’s.Chagla argued that it was unfair that a tower company that made a profit of Rs 1,800 crore in the year ended March 2017 should be made to give up its assets while only select portions of parent RCom and Reliance Telecom were being sold as part of the overall asset monetisation programme.He pointed out to the bench that RCom, after the monetisation, would be left with a viable, profitable, capital-light company looking into B2B areas, data enterprise, undersea cable and submarine business.“From insolvency, you (RCom) will now have a viable company. RCom stands to benefit and I am the only loser,” said the senior counsel. HSBC had invested about Rs 1,100 crore in July 2007 and has about 5% share, while the rest is owned by other firms under Anil Ambani.Reliance Infratel’s counsel countered that these were delaying tactics that would further erode the value of the telco’s assets and highlighted that the debt burden was the result of turbulence in the industry.“We are helpless since the entire telecom sector is in a bad shape. Today it is a case of survival.Blocking transactions will not help and it will reduce the value of the company,” said Ghone.RCom plans to use the funds raised to repay RCom’s 35 lenders by the end of March, failing which the lenders could take the company to the NCLT under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code.“If the sale does not happen, the joint lenders’ forum comprising of all lenders will be forced to sell the assets as distressed value. It will be sold as scrap,” said Ghone.The joint lenders forum led by State Bank of India, which decided not to convert RCom’s debt to equity pending the asset sale to Jio, also argued that if the sale was not allowed, it would affect the banks and the public.Birendra Saraf, appearing for the forum, argued that the bidding process for RCom’s assets, including the tower business, was done in a transparent way.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/another-set-back-for-anil-ambani-nclt-stays-sale-of-reliance-infratel-assets/articleshow/63211322.cms

2018-03-17,"KOLKATA: Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said the affordable JioPhone has been a runaway hit, with a massive 3 to 5 lakh Indians lapping up the lowcost 4G VoLTE phone every day to go digital.Ambani said he had “mandated” (telecom arm) Reliance Jio’s young engineers to innovate the world’s most affordable 4G LTE smartphone since as many as 500 million Indians were still using low-cost feature phones and remained excluded from the benefits of the digital revolution. Something, that led to the advent of the JioPhone.“The result has been stunning: 300,000-500,000 Indians are daily migrating to the JioPhone to access high-speed internet while their existing voice needs are completely free,” said Ambani. He was speaking at an event in London Thursday evening.The JioPhone, which was launched by Jio’s sister company, Reliance Retail, comes for a Rs 1,500 deposit, refundable after three years on return of the device. To avail themselves of the refund, subscribers need to recharge for a minimum Rs 1,500 a year, or a minimum Rs 49 a month. The phone is key to telecom new entrant Jio’s quest to increase its 160 million user base amid stiff competition from India’s top telcos such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Ambani said Jio, which has become the biggest game changer in India since its launch in September 2016, was his daughter Isha’s brainchild when she was a student at Yale University in the US. The idea of Jio, he said, “was first seeded by my daughter, Isha”, in 2011. “Isha was home for holidays and wanted to submit some coursework, and she said, Dad, internet in our house sucks,” Ambani said reminiscing on how Jio was conceived. His son, Akash, he recalled, had then captured the generation gap further by noting that while “telecom was voice in the old world, in the new world, everything was digital”, and that one could do a lot more with a digital network than just talk. Isha and Akash, Ambani said, belong to “India’s young generation that is far more creative, ambitious, and far more impatient to become best in the world”. “These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age, and India cannot be left behind,” said Ambani. The RIL chairman said Jio had created the world’s largest greenfield 4G-only LTE data network that would make “India a leader in 4G in 2019”, adding that the network is also “5G-ready”.Taking a veiled dig at rival incumbent carriers, Ambani said the combined Indian telecom industry took 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network, while Jio “took just three years to build a 4G LTE network which is much larger and far more advanced”. Jio, he said, had made high quality data available at the lowest price in the world, “at almost onetenth the prices in the US”.Within the next few years, Jio, he said, “would empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe’s population to enjoy world-class digital services in India”. With its abundance of youthful talent, India, he said “is poised to become the third largest economy by 2028, within a single decade”. Ambani said India would also be among the first to “graduate to the Internet of Everything”, especially as internet becomes accessible to all Indians.While the “internet of communication, content and commerce” existed, the coming years, he envisioned, would ring in the era of “an internet of intelligence that would power nextgen smart services, an internet of energy that would be the foundation of India’s energy security and an internet of trust that would create a framework for distributed transactions and contracts without intermediaries”.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-network-may-make-india-4g-leader-in-2019/articleshow/63337012.cms
2018-03-18,"MUMBAI: Reliance Communications has approached the Supreme Court seeking to remove a legal hurdle which threatens to stall its efforts to complete the sale of wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm and repay part of its Rs 45,000 crore debt before the end of March.RCom moved the Supreme Court last week, after the Bombay High Court dismissed its appeal against an arbitration tribunal ruling to bar the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission, people familiar with the matter. While the company faces other cases and curbs on transactions of some assets, the arbitration tribunal’s order affects the entire Rs 25,000 crore deal with Jio that is crucial for it to avoid landing in the bankruptcy court.RCom didn’t respond to an email seeking comment until press time Sunday.The petition in the Supreme Court is a last ditch effort by RCom, as the company and two of its units, Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom, race against time to complete the deal before the end of the fiscal year. It needs the money to repay 35 lenders, failing which they could take it to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code.The Anil Ambani-led telco in late December struck a deal to sell most of its spectrum, fibre, towers and switching nodes to Jio, promoted by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh.But Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson, which is claiming Rs 1,012 crore of arrears from RCom, got an arbitration tribunal order preventing the transfer of the telco’s assets till further orders. RCom approached the Bombay High Court against the tribunal’s order, but its appeal was dismissed over a week ago.RCom's stance in the case is that secured creditors, such as banks, rank above unsecured vendors like equipment supplier like Ericsson in any debt resolution plan. After the high court dismissed its appeal, the company said it would take “necessary actions in the best interest of all the stakeholders”.The telecom company is in the midst of several other legal battles that have thrown a spanner in its efforts to sell assets. It is expected to shortly appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against an NCLT stay order on the sale of its towers and optic fibre assets.The NCLT last week restrained Reliance Infratel from selling its towers and fibre to Jio for about Rs 8,000 crore till further order. That order came on a petition by HSBC Daisy Investments and some other minority shareholders — together holding just over 4% in the tower company — that their consent was not sought for the asset sale and, if allowed, it would be an “oppression of a minority shareholder under section 397 and 398” as Reliance Infratel would become defunct.RCom also faces a spate of other lawsuits on recovery of arrears. Last month, American Tower Company moved the Delhi High Court against the telco and subsidiary Reliance Telecom to get security for recovery of Rs 100.63 crore of dues. It claimed that carrier had not made payments for services provided to it from July to December last year. Last week, communications solutions provider Avaya India also moved the NCLT for recovery of Rs 7.5 crore.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/policy/reliance-communications-moves-supreme-court-for-asset-sale-relief/articleshow/63357631.cms

Time period given by analyst is year when Federal Bank Ltd. price can reach defined target.Invesetment rationale by Reliance Securities The bank is expected to deliver further improvement in operational performance led by improving loan book growth and improving assets liability mix. Advances grew by 5.3 per cent QoQ to Rs 850bn in 3QFY18, as SME, Wholesale and Retail (including Agri) book grew by 13.3%, 4.4% and 6.85% QoQ respectively. Further, continued moderation in SMA-2 balance clearly suggests fresh slippage will show declining trend in FY19. Notably, the bank is gradually coming out of the scenario marked with higher provisioning and continued stress on asset quality for last few quarters.

2018-03-20,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm has approached the telecom tribunal seeking to be impleaded in a case filed by rivals Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular against a recent predatory pricing order by the sector regulator, said lawyers aware of the matter.Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) has issued notices to Airtel and Idea to file their responses to Jio’s impleading application and the matter will heard in its next hearing on April 17, a lawyer representing one of the incumbent carriers said. The two incumbents had moved the tribunal arguing that predatory pricing rules issued by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on February 16 favoured new entrant Jio at their cost.“Reliance Jio and telecom watchdog had filed separate applications to be impleaded as parties in the appeals,” said the lawyer who requested not to be named. “Telecom watchdog’s petition was disposed of since Trai was already representing consumer interest in any case,” the person said. Reliance Jio did not comment on the development.The sector regulator had last month issued a tariff order that mandated a new formula to determine predatory pricing. It changed the definition of significant market player (SMP) and gave tariff flexibility only to operators with less than 30% of the market’s subscribers or revenue. Previous SMP parameters such as volume of traffic, including data, and switching capacity, were dropped. The regulator can levy a penalty of Rs 50 lakh per violation if a tariff is found to be predatory. Trai also barred operators from offering tariff plans to only some customers in a bid to retain them, adding that all plans must be displayed on a company’s website and made available to every user. India’s top three operators – Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular – contended the rules favoured Jio, which has 13-14% share of revenue and users. Airtel and the proposed Vodafone-Idea Cellular combine would each have over 30% revenue market share. They further said the rule of not providing offers to retain customers was against the companies’ rights to do business, and therefore cannot be implemented. Airtel and Idea filed petitions in the telecom tribunal on March 4 against implementation of the Trai order until the resolution of their pleas, and asked for penalties not to be levied for non-compliance in the interim. They did not win any immediate relief though, as the tribunal wanted to hear views of Trai, which was not a party to the case at that time. Vodafone India, meanwhile, moved the Madras High Court last week, challenging the regulator’s order and the specific clause preventing it from retaining customers by offering individual offers. It won a favourable order on Saturday, which allows the company to continue to give those offers till the matter is heard next month. Legal experts said the court’s order might give a boost to the pleas of Airtel and Idea in TDSAT.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jio-seeks-to-be-impleaded-in-case-against-trais-predatory-pricing-order/articleshow/63387656.cms

Incumbent telcos such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular offer 2G and 3G services, along with 4G, but their VoLTE offerings lag Jio by a long way in terms of coverage.Mobile phone operators currently pay 5% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) towards USOF.

2018-03-27,"Talking to ET Now, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, says in OMCs, the larger part of the gain should be in the integrated plays and that is why one should put money into Reliance. Edited excerpts:Since oil has crossed the $70 per barrel mark, OMCs have seen quite a bit of movement. What is your view?The spike in the oil prices appears to be temporary. Assuming that oil remains in the steady range of around $60-$65 per barrel, the upstream companies possibly will have relatively better time compared to the downstream companies including the volatility.The upstream companies should be relatively better off but whether one should buy aggressively into the upstream company, the answer would not be an immediate yes, but Reliance would be a relatively better play because of the complete integration and the ability to process the high sulphur grade of crude which gives them an edge over the others as far as the GRM is concerned. We do not put money into the oil marketing companies and the upstream companies immediately while staying invested with Reliance as we believe the conviction level is high in that particular company.The H1 borrowing programme which got announced yesterday is bound to ease the pain in bond markets but on the other hand it is also going to benefit banks too which have been pressured on their books. Would that change the case for investment in PSU banks or it is a pocket you would still stay away from?Well certainly it is a breather and it is a very smart management of money by the government instead of borrowing money from the public markets, wWe are utilising the money from the small saving funds. From that perspective, it is a win-win combination of finance management the government is doing at the centre level. Given that situation, the bond yields are not likely to go up and in such a situation, it would be a breather for the PSBs. Their mark to market provisioning on the bond side would remain in control. Definitely, this is a positive thing along with some of the banks getting the benefits out of the NCLT divestment process which are happening currently both these things are appearing positive in the medium to long term for sure. However, I am not too sure whether in the short term there are enough reasons for buying into the PSBs. My own take is that I think the PSBs would probably struggle a bit more here and at the same time I think they are struggling to recover their money from the non-performing assets though the process has started as I mentioned. I would still think that the larger part of the PSB space would struggle for some more quarters as I see it. In immediate short-term, there are no buys on PSBs though I do agree that with the price many of the front line PSBs have become relatively more attractive compared to what they were likes of SBI but still my money would at this point of time go to some of the quality names in the NBFC today in the housing finance companies or even for that matter corporate banks even though they are slightly expensively traded given the situation, I would probably put more money into the corporate banks and the typical housing finance company.Why are oil marketing stocks falling? For a sector which was always on the losing end because of high crude prices and now on the receiving end of high prices because companies are likely to report an inventory gain. Yet, there is a lot of nervousness in some of these stocks?Being an election year, it is feared that some amount of price comfort will come and the OMCs will not be able to pass on the complete hike in the crude oil prices. That could be one of the reasons for which many of the funds are choosing to reduce their exposure into this particular space and that is the main reason we can attribute to it at this point of time. Plus of course, there is a reason to shift into some of the more attractive companies particularly in the frontline faces where the valuations are becoming very attractive for investment. Mutual funds have been shuffling their portfolios and they have been reducing the exposure into commodity driven stocks and shifting money to BFSI stocks, especially the insurance space.Finally, in OMCs, the larger part of the gain should be there in the integrated play and that is why one should put money into Reliance. What is the view on metals? Would you say the cyclical nature of the commodity is very much in place and irrespective of the volatile bouts that we have seen of late, would the uptrend in metals remain intact?The reason to remain confident about the metal cycle is largely due to the fact that India is in an expansion mode. The current level of infrastructure activities that the country is experiencing supports the metal commodity prices in this part of the world.If you look at domestic companies, you can see that they not many have added the capacities in the recent past and as a result, we believe that given the kind of consumption cycle that we are seeing, we will have higher amount of capacity eventually. Certainly, it supports the argument for the price which will remain steady to firm from current levels.Along with that, the crude oil prices are also remaining firm. So, in the metal commodity space in the global market you would find the prices remaining strong. The import duty on some of the metals which America has imposed, puts in an argument for a little higher metal prices which could possibly be beneficiary to the metal companies in the near term.It will take another 3-6 months for the industry to absorb this particular price behaviour of the commodity. So, we relatively remain confident on the metal space and companies which are in metal consumption space.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/deven-choksey-on-why-it-is-time-to-buy-into-reliance/articleshow/63476468.cms

Earlier this month, the court had directed DMRC to pay an arbitration award of Rs 2,950 crore to Reliance Infrastructure as compensation for violating their agreement on operating the Airport Express Line in the capital. The total amount with interest stands at Rs 5,164 crore.“The high court held that a party successful in arbitration and Section 34 cannot be allowed to become an NPA for want of enforcement of the award. The court directed that it is just and necessary that the amount sufficient to avert the declaration of the accounts of the petitioner as NPA should be paid by DMRC to the 11 banks before March 28, 2018,” Reliance Infrastructure said in a statement. In case where the accounts have already become NPA, the court has ordered that such minimum amount shall be paid by DMRC for the said accounts to be upgraded and excluded from the purview of being NPA. Reliance Infrastructure moved court to expedite the payment as four banks have already declared the loan account of DAMEPL as NPA and Allahabad Bank has recalled the entire loan of DAMEPL.DAMEPL, which had the contract to develop and operate the Airport Express Line in Delhi, won the arbitration award in May last year in the case relating to termination of the contract in 2012. The Anil Ambani-led company terminated the agreement citing that DMRC had failed to fix civil structure defects in the project. The company sought compensation and the dispute was referred to the arbitration tribunal.The tribunal, formed out of a DMRC-nominated panel as required by the concession agreement, heard the case for 3 ½ years and granted a verdict in favour of Reliance Infra.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/hc-directs-dmrc-to-pay-rs-306-crore-to-reliance-infra-arm-to-save-it-from-turning-into-npa/articleshow/63489124.cms

Several fund houses already changed the basic attributes of their existing schemes to comply by the new norms. Mutual fund investors are likely to see their schemes changing their basic attribute or merging with another scheme in the coming days.What should be their strategy? According to mutual fund advisors, investors should first find out the changes and act only if the change is not in line with their investment objective. For example, when a largecap scheme is merged with a mid and smallcap scheme to form a multicap scheme as in the case of Reliance, many investors would find the change clashing with their investment objective.“If a largecap scheme merges with a midcap scheme to form a multicap scheme, the investors will definitely see a change in their portfolio. If the portfolio changes, we have to get it back on track by investing in other schemes,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan, Founder, Prakala Wealth Management.Mutual fund advisors believe that merger of funds will lead to changes in the current portfolio of many investors. “An aggressive investor has to invest in a mid and smallcap scheme to reach his goal in a definite time. If the scheme becomes a largecap or a multicap, it will be problem for the investor’s plan,” says Deepali Sen, Founder, Srujan Financial Advisors.In such situations, mutual fund advisors believe that switching to another scheme is the only way out. But switching schemes may incur costs in the form of exit loads and taxation. “Generally, in such situations, the fund houses do not charge exit loads if you switch within a given time period. But we have to look at the taxation part. That can’t be ruled out,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan.Mutual fund advisors also suggest that investors should refrain from tinkering with their portfolio with half knowledge about the happenings. They suggest that investors should wait till all the fund houses are done with changing and re categorizing the schemes. “Right now only a few fund houses have made the mergers official. We should wait for all the schemes to get in the same line and then make decisions. Only after we have the full information we can think of switches and managing the changes in the portfolio better. Till then, just wait and watch,” says Deepali Sen.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/reliance-mf-is-merging-its-focused-large-cap-fund-with-mid-and-small-cap-fund-what-should-you-do/articleshow/63502539.cms

2018-04-05,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s fourth quarter net profit is expected to remain flat sequentially at around Rs 504 crore, on an about 3 per cent rise in revenue to Rs 7,100 crore, on the back of robust subscriptions from its continuing loyalty programme Prime, analysts said.ICICI Securities estimates Jio’s Prime membership revenue to jump as much as 80 per cent to Rs 900 crore in the March quarter from Rs 500 crore in the October-December period, although it sees the 4G newcomer’s recharge revenues dipping 3.2 per cent on-quarter and costs rising slightly.Another analyst at a leading foreign brokerage estimates Jio’s fourth quarter revenue to grow 8-9 per cent sequentially to Rs 7,500 crore.ICICI Securities, however, expects the telecom arm of Reliance Industries (RIL) to report “an 11.1 per cent sequential fall in average revenue per user (ARPU) to Rs 137 in the March quarter from Rs 154 in the October-December period”, triggered by the sharp cut in its base offer to JioPhone users at Rs 49/month and users moving to lower priced bundled plans.Analysts though expect Jio to outperform India’s older operators Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular in the January-March quarter as well. In that period, market leader Airtel is expected to post its first loss in 15 years — at about Rs 58.5 crore, according to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which expects Idea to widen its loss to Rs 1,494 crore from Rs 1,284.5 crore in the December quarter.ICICI Securities expects Jio to also steal a march over Bharti Airtel and Idea on customer-adds, estimating a 15.6 per cent sequential jump in the 4G newcomer’s subscriber base in the fourth quarter to 185 million, compared to modest 3.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent on-quarter growth estimates for Airtel and Idea Cellular, respectively. This, it said, is despite the fact that listed incumbents benefited on this score in the March quarter after fringe player Aircel filed for bankruptcy.Analysts estimate a 1.6 per cent on-quarter rise in Jio’s fourth quarter operating income at Rs 2,670 crore. But they predict a 55 basis points (bps) on-quarter dip in the telco’s Ebitda margin to 37.6 per cent.Having upended the market with its free voice and dirt cheap data rates since its launch in September 2016, Jio is expected to continue to disrupt pricing till it attains a revenue market share of around 30 per cent, compared with 15.4 per cent now, said HSBC, Further evidence of continuing competition was Jio’s move to offer its loyalty programme Prime free for existing members for another year, while offering it to new ones for a one-time fee of Rs 99.“As the market heads towards a three-player structure (amid ongoing sector consolidation), Jio’s behaviour would change once it approaches 30 per cent RMS, which may happen by end-FY19, and could be a point at which we would expect slightly less price competition in the market,” said Rajiv Sharma, HSBC director and telecom analyst.Under the circumstances, Sharma said “any pricing improvement may be 4-5 quarters away”, given that Jio’s RMS in the December quarter stood at 15.4 per cent. Analysts, however, have said Jio’s free extension of Prime subscription by a year could trigger a minimum 8-10 per cent sequential dilution in its ARPU in the first quarter of FY19.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jios-q4-net-profit-likely-to-remain-flat-q-o-q/articleshow/63622729.cms

2018-04-06,"The Supreme Court gave partial relief to Reliance Communications on Thursday, allowing it to sell most of its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm to pare its nearly Rs 45,000-crore debt. However, RCom will require separate approval for selling tower and fibre assets, from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).A two-judge bench, headed by Justice AK Goel, set aside the stay on sale of assets imposed by the Bombay High Court on March 8. Lenders got the go-ahead to sell RCom’s spectrum, real estate and switching nodes — which, till now, could not be done without prior permission of an arbitral court. However, the bench did not lift the stay imposed by a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order, on sale of towers and fibre housed under Reliance Infratel. It instead asked RCom to move NCLAT as per procedure to get the stay vacated.“Accordingly, there is now no bar in immediately completing asset sales of spectrum, MCNs and real estate and it shall be concluded expeditiously,” RCom said in a statement on Thursday.The Anil Ambani-owned company added that it will file an appeal on Friday before the NCLAT. NCLT granted the stay in favour of minority investors, including HSBC Daisy Investment, who hold just over 4% stake and had objected to the sale of Reliance Infratel’s towers and fibre. RCom said it was “confident of securing appropriate relief from the NCLAT to enable sales of tower and fibre assets to also be completed at the earliest. The claim of the minority investors (which is fully disputed by RCom) can, in any case, be a maximum of approximately Rs 200-300 crore of the sales proceeds.”It added that it is confident of achieving overall debt reduction of Rs 25,000 crore by selling spectrum, tower, fibre and switching nodes within the next few weeks. RCom’s shares rose 4.47% on the Bombay Stock Exchange to Rs 23.35 on Thursday.LITIGATION TRAILThe carrier had moved the apex court on March 19 against orders of the Bombay High Court and NCLT barring it from selling its wireless assets to Jio without prior approval. An arbitral tribunal had first passed these orders early March, on the plea of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson, which had sought to recover unpaid dues of over Rs 1,000 crore. The high court upheld these orders.NCLT had separately passed its orders on a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius), which had alleged oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.Senior advocate Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for RCom in the Supreme Court on Thursday, said the telco’s value would deteriorate to the extent that it would be unable to pay even secured lenders, if it is not allowed to sell assets.Ten banks, including SBI, argued for the right to sell RCom’s property as it was mortgaged by them, saying the arbitration tribunal cannot take away this right. Ericsson agreed with the banks’ having first right but argued against the sale of assets being a private arrangement between seller and buyer. RACE TO REDUCE DEBTFor RCom, it’s a race against time. Sale of towers, optic fibre, right-to-use spectrum and media convergence nodes to Jio will pare give it about Rs 25,000 crore. The two companies already have approval from the Competition Commission of India.Sale of RCom’s 125 acres at DKAC, Navi Mumbai, with approximately 20 million square feet of development space, will further pare this debt by Rs 7,000 crore. This deal, though, it still to be sealed.RCom said last month that it was in discussions with a global strategic partner for further debt reduction, which will occur upon a stake sale.

The apex court had directed RCom to move NCLAT as per procedure to get the stay vacated.The NCLT had stayed the sale of the towers and fibre on a plea by minority investors, including HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) - who hold a shade over 4% in Reliance Infratel - alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.RCom said the NCLAT, through the interim order, had vacated the remaining stay (imposed by NCLT), and “allowed execution of sale deeds”.“RCom can now proceed with the completion of its entire asset monetization plan of approximately Rs 25,000 crore, covering spectrum, towers, fibre, media convergence nodes (MCNs) and real estate,” the Anil Ambani-led telco said in a media statement Friday.The NCLAT, however, has asked RCom to deposit the tower and fibre asset sale proceeds into an State Bank of India (SBI) escrow account and scheduled a final hearing on April 18 to decide on the distribution of such proceeds.RCom said ""it is confident of achieving overall debt reduction of Rs 25,000 crore approx within the next few weeks, from its asset monetisation programme”.Based on legal advise, RCom pegs the claim of minority investors in the tower and fibre proceeds, which it fully disputes, “can at best be Rs 200-300 crore”. The Anil Ambani-led telco, which aims to cut is Rs 45,000 crore debt through sale of its infrastructure, had earlier moved the Supreme Court on March 19 against orders of the Bombay High Court and NCLT barring it for selling its wireless assets to Jio.On Thursday, a two-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice A K Goel, had set aside the stay on sale of assets imposed by the Bombay High Court on March 8.An arbitral tribunal had first passed these orders in early March, on the plea of Swedish telecom vendor Ericsson, which had sought to recover unpaid dues upwards of Rs 1,000 crore. The high court had upheld these orders.For RCom, it’s has been a race against time. Sale of towers, optic fibre, right-to-use spectrum and MCNs to Jio will pare its debt by nearly Rs 25,000 crore. The two companies already have approval from the Competition Commission of India.Sale of RCom’s 125 acres at DKAC, Navi Mumbai, with approximately 20 million square feet of development space, will further reduce this debt by Rs 7,000 crore. This deal, though, it yet to be concluded.RCom said last month that it was in talks with a global strategic partner for further debt reduction, which would occur upon a stake sale. ET had last week reported that Russia’s Sistema JSFC had put in a bid for RCom’s residual telecom assets.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/nclat-vacates-stay-on-reliance-infras-tower-fibre-sale/articleshow/63641507.cms
2018-04-06,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Infrastructure's (Rinfra) subsidiary DAMEPL today moved the Delhi High Court seeking attachment of DMRC's bank accounts for not depositing 75 per cent of the over Rs 5,164 crore arbitral award, including interest, within the time given by the court.Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), in an application, said that the high court in its March 6 order, while upholding the arbitral award in favour of the Rinfra subsidiary, had granted DMRC four weeks to deposit 75 per cent of the amount.The money was to be deposited in an escrow account maintained with the banks which had loaned money to DAMEPL for the Airport Express line project.In its application, which came for hearing before Justice Vibhu Bakhru, DAMEPL said that till date the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has only deposited Rs 306 crore.The court did not pass any order and listed the matter for hearing on April 10 after the DMRC said it has challenged the March 6 order and the appeal is expected to be heard by a larger bench on April 9.DAMEPL, in its application filed through advocate Rishi Agarwal, has sought attachment of DMRC's bank accounts to the extent of the amount it has to deposit in the escrow account.Earlier on March 23, the high court had directed DMRC to settle the immediate amounts that DAMEPL owes the banks for the Airport metro line project, so that its accounts are not termed non-performing assets (NPAs).It had directed DMRC to ascertain what is the immediate amount that DAMEPL has to pay to the 11 lending banks and to make the payment before March 28.The court said that the accounts of DAMEPL in the banks cannot be allowed to become NPAs despite having an arbitral award in its favour.The direction came on an interim plea by DAMEPL claiming it has to pay over Rs 1,882 crore to the banks to prevent its accounts with them from being categorised as NPAs.According to DAMEPL's plea, the 11 banks to whom immediate payments have to be made are -- Axis Bank, UCO Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank, Andhra Bank, Central Bank of India, Dena Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India, IIFC UK and Canara Bank London.On March 6, while dismissing DMRC's plea against the Arbitral Tribunal's May, 2017 order asking it to make payments to DAMEPL, the court had allowed a separate plea of the Rinfra subsidiary for an early payment of 75 per cent of the arbitral award in its favour.The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding at the depot, and the balance, including the project system works, were to be executed by DAMEPL.The Airport Express line was commissioned on February 23, 2011 after an investment of Rs 2,885 crore, funded by the DAMEPL's promoters' fund, banks and financial institutions.DAMEPL had said it had terminated the concession agreement as DMRC had not cured certain defects in the Airport Express line within 90 days of a notice issued by it.It had also said the agreement had come to effect from January 1, 2013 and the project was handed over to DMRC on June 30, 2013. Till the handing over of the project, DAMEPL had operated the line as a deemed agent of DMRC, it had said.The arbitration was entered into in August, 2013 after efforts to amicably resolve the issue did not yield any result.DAMEPL is a joint venture of Rinfra and a Spanish construction company -- Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles -- with a shareholding of 95 and five per cent respectively.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/reliance-subsidiary-moves-delhi-high-court-seeking-attachment-of-dmrc-accounts/articleshow/63646415.cms
2018-04-07,"Vodafone India, the country's second-biggest phone company, is set to launch an ambush marketing campaign in a bid to upstage Reliance Jio Infocomm during the two-month-long Indian Premier League cricket tournament that starts Saturday, said people with knowledge of the matter.The move comes as the mobile phone operator, which is merging with Idea Cellular, battles rivals Jio and Bharti Airtel for data revenue and subscribers. Jio is a co-presenting sponsor for all eight teams playing in the tournament.After 10 years of being an associate sponsor, Vodafone is just a spot buyer this year. Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Jio did not respond to ET’s queries.With an investment of ₹20-25 crore— modest in comparison with Jio's ₹90-100 crore spending—the ‘guerilla’ technique will be needed to get attention from an expected 700 million viewers, said the people cited above, up from 450 million last year. The company is said to have modelled its plan on Pepsi’s ‘Nothing official about it’ campaign during the 1996 World Cup that was aimed at undercutting tournament sponsor Coca-Cola.Vodafone is expected to rollout its advertising campaigns along with game shows and consumer engagement programmes across cities from Saturday. Sources said Idea Cellular will launch competitive offers as well. Vodafone India and Idea Cellular are in the midst of a merger exercise that’s expected to conclude in a few months and result in India’s biggest phone company, overtaking Bharti Airtel.

2018-04-09,"MUMBAI: The Reliance family office, the private company of Mukesh Ambani, is close to acquiring a majority stake in Embibe.com, an online education portal, for close to Rs 100 crore, two people with knowledge of the matter said.A transaction will likely see the promoters and current investors in the Mumbai-based education portal, which prepares students for competitive entrance tests, selling their stake. “The deal is as good as done,” said one person.“The discussions were on for some time after the Reliance family office directly approached the portal.” There is no investment banker involved in the deal, he added.Reliance Industries and Embibe did not respond to ET’s emails sent on April 4, seeking comment on the matter. The acquisition has been planned keeping in mind the requirements of Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom arm, according to another person familiar with the matter.“Reliance would need content when data becomes big, especially as Jio keeps increasing its holding in this segment. Education is only one sector where the data play was missing from the company’s standpoint, which would be complete after the acquisition,” he said.Embibe had acquired 100Markes, an engineering and medical entrance exam training portal, in a cashplus-stock deal in 2015 for an undeclared amount. Both people told ET that the Reliance family office is trying to acquire 100% of Embibe.A deal with Reliance would allow two funds that invested in Embibe in 2013 to exit. Kalaari Capital and Lightbox Ventures had put in about $4 million, or close to Rs 25 crore together. Both funds were early-stage investors in the company that was founded in 2012 by Aditi Avasthi.Embibe was initially backed by Sandeep Murthy, who led the India investments of some Silicon Valley venture capital firms, according to media reports. Both funds would make “healthy returns” from the deal, one person said. Emails sent to the funds on Saturday did not elicit any response.

2018-04-11,"Talking to ET Now, Sanjay Parekh, Reliance Mutual Fund, says we will see very high accelerated slippages this quarter and maybe FY19 also would get a little lower ROEs and ROAs and higher credit cost. But beyond that, they look quite promising.Edited excerpts:Having exposure to the banking sector and looking at the Reliance Banking Fund, what do you as an investment manager feel about the developments in the banking sector?There are two aspects to it. Clearly governance, ownership and risk management are extremely critical and we have seen that banks which are very strong on all three have benefitted and the rest of them certainly have their concerns. But we certainly have to see the positive side of it also. We have come a long way on this sector in terms of reforms. The banks have got the government infused capital. We can debate whether it was enough. Then you are seeing the resolution process. All the stakeholders are working in cohesion. There could be some litigation. There could be some speed breakers, but by and large, directionally you ask any of them and people are positive. The third part is reforms. First, in the steel sector, now in the power sector where the stress is higher. Things cannot change overnight but it would gradually get better. Also, credit growth is looking better and that will certainly help. The yields also have now softened, so the scare of rising yield at times causing pain on the bond portfolio has also receded. The overall macro is by and large in control, barring that fiscal deficit could get a little higher but if you take balance of payment or inflation, things are by and large under control. All these are actually very strong tailwinds for the banking sector. You have a choice today, you have private banks with less asset quality issues and there is a huge opportunity there. Then you have these large corporate banks, going through this transition and we have to see what is in the price. There are negatives. The RBI guideline will accelerate the NPA provisioning in Q4 and even in FY19. But all these mean tighter credit standards, better governance ahead and that really augurs well for the banking sector.Also, what is the discipline of borrowers? The discipline of borrowers is really going to get established. Even the corporate banks, the retail banks are really strong. The corporate banks are going through a transition. We will see Q4 being weak. We will see very high accelerated slippages this quarter and maybe FY19 also would get a little lower ROEs and ROAs and higher credit cost. But beyond that, they look quite promising.The Reliance Banking Fund has outperformed on all timelines. From 25th May 2003, it has outperformed the index with a return of 24% annualised basis. 26% weightage is with HDFC Bank, Bharat Financial is next, ICICI Bank also has a sizable position. You also have some holding in SBI. Should investors look at ICICI Bank favourably through this leadership transition or is it really wait and watch?I will guide you through the broad framework we used because we will not get into the specifics. So, the key thought was that one is a set of private banks with less asset quality pain and as the fax sheet suggests you have HDFC Bank or Bharat Finance which will be transiting to IndusInd Bank and then Kotak Bank. All three put together is almost 42%. These are banks which will gain market share. They have strong franchise. The CASA is strong. ROAs and ROEs will be very strong and they will gain market share ahead also. We believe that even if you do not take re-rating upwards, even if we get the earnings growth led appreciation, that is very good. It is about the risk rather than return in these banks. You obviously have to get the risk adjusted return right. The second piece is corporate banks where we are only into the large corporate banks -- be it private or public and the largest. There we are significantly underweight compared to our benchmark and as the fax sheet suggests, we have just two large corporate banks and there too we are underweight. Our view is that we are going through a transition. The retail piece of both of them is very strong. There are subsidiary values which are very good. All the subsidiaries are doing well. They would have higher credit cost in Q4 and FY19 also would have a higher credit cost but the valuations are really reasonable now. On adjusted book value, they are now at one time on forward basis. We think that a lot of it is in the price and we will have to see some more pain in earnings ahead but on a longer term, there is value. That is our view on these large corporate banks. Then we have select housing finance, insurance play, NBFCs which by and large are going to do well. We have seen even the bond yields coming off. So, some of these NBFCs which had a problem on a liability side, may actually not be the case.The IndusInd Bank stock is up 20x over 10 years. But if you bought into Axis Bank or ICICI Bank, you haven’t really got handsome returns. So, betting on corporate banks even though they were cheap three years ago or were cheap five years ago has not really been a great exercise. Whereas if you bought a retail facing NBFC or retail facing bank, you have pretty much hit a home run in last four-five years. Do you think that trend towards retail dominated franchise will continue?You are right. One, we are very positive on the retail focussed bank/NBFCs with less asset quality problems. We think there is a secular three-, five- and ten-year story there. We still feel that valuations are reasonable. They are not rich because for the ROAs, ROEs and sustainable growth, you take on price earnings basis. Price to adjusted book basis is reasonable. We are very clear and that is showing up in our weights which is a significant outsized weight. The second piece is the corporate banks where we are underweight in our banking portfolio. Having said that the retail piece, you cannot break a bank but if you take the retail piece of these banks with CASA of 47-48%, you are actually giving a significant negative value to the corporate piece. We feel that if you take the gross stress right now and let us say the gross stress I am talking of is NPA plus the other stress going around now.Did you juggle your portfolio when it came to the banking fund? Has HDFC Bank come off after that high weightage that you had of 26.25%? , Have you upped your weightage and ownership in ICICI Bank or an SBI or have you brought it down in the last one month or so?Without getting into specifics, we had reduced our weight in corporate banks when we got the RBI guideline and we were underweight already.We have increased our underweight in corporate banks but we believe from here onwards, they have significantly corrected and we really believe that while there could be some more bad news ahead, the recent lows that we have seen are a very attractive level to increase rate. But you need to keep in mind that certainly the Q4 could be painful. Even the first half of FY19 could be a little painful but we are very confident that these large corporate banks, I am not talking of the small PSU corporate banks but the large corporate banks, would certainly have a better FY20.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/retail-focussed-banks-nbfcs-are-secular-3-10-year-stories-sanjay-parekh-reliance-mf/articleshow/63729314.cms

2018-04-12,"MUMBAI : Reliance Industries is set to acquire Alok Industries with majority of lenders to the bankrupt textile company voting in favour of the resolution plan given by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s company, two officials familiar with the development said.JM Financial ARC had bid, in partnership with Reliance Industries, for Alok Industries, making an all cash offer in the range of 15-20 per cent of outstanding loan, they said.“The offer is marginally higher than the liquidation value of the company and that is the reason that banks are willing to vote in favour,” one of them said.The liquidation value of the company is pegged at Rs 4,200 crore while the offer is in the range of Rs 4,500-5,000 crore, the sources said. There is no equity upside for lenders under the proposal given by JM Financial ARC and Reliance.Alok Industries has received claims of Rs 29,500 crore from lenders with State Bank of India being the lead bank. On Wednesday, the resolution professional had held a meeting of committee of creditors to vote for the resolution plan. Senior officials said most lenders have given a positive vote for the plan. The actual percentage of votes in favour and against will be known only on Thursday since the voting was on till late evening.“With the 270 days deadline three days away — on April 14 — lenders are not in a position to bargain a better deal,” said one of the officials cited earlier. Alok Industries is one of the few companies wherein the resolution professional (RP) has called for a resolution plan several times after it was admitted. In March alone, the RP invited binding bids twice. The RP had set a deadline of March 13 when it received just one bid from JM Financial ARC. However, lenders rejected it since JM Financial ARC did not disclose the name of the strategic partner. Lenders felt that the bidder has to comply with Section 29(A), which bars defaulters from bidding for resolution plan and therefore names of strategic partners have to be disclosed for them to take a decision on the bid. The second round of bidding concluded on March 27. If 75 per cent of the lenders in terms of value of loan give their consent to the plan, the RP has to submit it to the NCLT for approval.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-jm-financials-arc-to-buy-alok-industries/articleshow/63726615.cms

2018-04-12,"NEW DELHI: A laptop with a SIM card -- after smartphones and the 4G feature phone -- could be the next big bet for Reliance Jio in its bid to increase its average revenue per user (ARPU).The Mukesh Ambani-led Jio has held talks with US chip major Qualcomm to bring out laptops running the Windows 10 operating system with built-in cellular connections for the Indian market. Qualcomm is already closely working with Jio and Reliance Retail for the 4G feature phone.“…we have talked to Jio. They could take the device and bundle it with data and content,” Miguel Nunes, senior director, product management, Qualcomm Technologies, told ET.The chipmaker is also talking to home-bred Internet of Things (IoT) brand Smartron to bring the Snapdragon 835-powered laptops with cellular connectivity. Smartron confirmed the talks.Globally, Qualcomm is already working with players such as HP, Asus and Lenovo for the so-called “Always Connected PCs”. Besides, Nunes said that there are now 14 operators that have extended their support for this new category, including the US’ Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and major carriers in Germany, Italy, the UK, France, and Australia.Jio, which didn’t respond to ET’s queries, already has a device play in the country through its sister company, Reliance Retail, which sells MiFi dongles, LYF smartphones and 4G feature phone. It currently sources these devices from various Chinese original device markets (ODMs).Neil Shah, research director, devices & ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, said that cellular-connected laptops could be the next big ARPU device for operators beyond smartphones.As per Counterpoint data, close to five million laptops are sold every year in India with most of them connecting to either enterprise or home or public WiFi spots.""So if these productivity-centric devices are connected to cellular networks, it will boost the value proposition, driving growth for this segment: first, by providing ubiquitous connectivity on the go and, second, in terms of privacy and security as the cellular connectivity is highly secure compared to WiFi hotspots,"" Shah said.According to Counterpoint, if operators can connect a million laptops -- 20% of total sold in a year -- to 4G networks by end of next year, and can charge close to Rs 300 (US$5) to Rs 1000 (US$15) per month, pricing depending upon the usage or QoS for a “premium grade” data connection, this could generate close to $5 million or Rs 30 crore revenue per month, or close to Rs 360 crore per year at a minimum to more than Rs 1000 crore a year from these users.Qualcomm's Nunes said, ""We are trying to make sure that the operators understand the value. It’s new for the OEMs, new for the operators, and new for the channel.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/reliance-jio-bets-big-on-laptops-with-cellular-connections-in-talks-with-qualcomm/articleshow/63720346.cms
2018-04-13,"MUMBAI: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has tapped the yield-hungry Japanese loan market to help expand its telecom empire.The telecom company, owned by India’s richest man, raised $500 million through a syndicated Samurai loan from three Japanese banks, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Mizuho Bank, two people familiar with the matter told ET. The floating-rate loan is for a seven-year period.An email sent to Reliance Industries (RIL), the parent company of Jio, remained unanswered until the publication of this report. The Japanese banks involved in the fund-raising could not be contacted immediately.Loaded with huge cash deposits and shrinking investment options in homeland projects, high-street Japanese banks are chasing bankable debt securities in high-growth overseas markets. Indian Railway Finance Corp. and power utility NTPC were among the other large Indian companies that sought to raise funds through Samurai loans, Bloomberg reported last month.The average cost of debt, funded through Japanese banks, works out to be among the lowest in international financing markets. Hence, Samurai loans typically help reduce the borrower’s weighted average cost of capital. The Jio loan has been priced after adding 65 basis points over the Japanese yen-LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The LIBOR is a benchmark rate linked to different currencies.Jio, which raised the loan a few days ago, is seeking to diversify its borrowing base. Entering a new market for borrowing also helps get business in the long run, said one of the persons cited above. The proceeds may be used for the telecom company’s expansion.Last month, RIL’s board approved raising Rs 20,000 crore through debt in tranches. Analysts said the funds could be used to finance the capital expenditure requirements of Jio, including paying for the wireless assets of Reliance Communications bought under a deal signed late December. Also, RIL is seeking to enhance its contents library.“Our network continues to rapidly expand across the country. And in the next 12 months, Jio services will cover 99% of our country’s population,” Mukesh Ambani said last year during a speech delivered at the annual general meeting.Having invested more than Rs 2,00,000 crore and signing up about 175 million subscribers, Jio is also expanding its 4G network rapidly and aims to double its telecom-tower infrastructure to reach the entire population by this year end.Jio’s capex needs include about Rs 25,000 crore to be paid to Reliance Communications for wireless assets, including spectrum, towers, optic fibre and switching nodes.RIL’s decision to raise funds comes a few days after market leader Bhati Airtel announced its plans to borrow Rs 16,500 crore afresh to refinance existing loans and pay for spectrum.Jio spent about Rs 7,000 crore as capex in the December quarter and has said it expects capex levels to be similar in the ongoing March quarter.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-raises-500-million-in-samurai-loan-from-japanese-banks/articleshow/63741096.cms

2018-04-14,"By NC BipindraIndia is reducing its dependence on Russia for critical defence programs, with the joint venture BrahMos missile set to be guided by a locally-developed target tracking device in the next year.India’s defence scientists have developed a new indigenous system that identifies missile targets to replace the Russian-developed seeker on all future BrahMos, Sudhir K. Mishra, the chief executive officer of BrahMos Aerospace said.""Our objective is to make use of the Indian seeker on all future BrahMos missiles,"" Mishra said in an interview on the sidelines of India’s defence show, DefExpo, on Wednesday in Chennai. ""The Russians say if the Indians supply a cheaper, cost-effective and reliable seeker, then let us take it from India.""There are also plans to use a locally-made warhead on the missile, he said, without specifying a time frame.Russia accounted for 68 percent of India’s arms import from 2012 to 2016, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It’s been the largest defence supplier to India since the 1960s when the MiG-21 supersonic fighter jets were bought to equip the Indian Air Force. These were then license-produced at the state-held Hindustan Aeronautics Limited until recently, when India began to junk the MiG jets and plan a complete phase out of the aircraft by 2022.Military ModernisationAs Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes ahead with his military modernisation process with a targeted $250 billion spend over 10 years till 2025, India has widened the scope of its arms purchases to include equipment from the US In the last two years, the US has emerged as India’s top defence supplier. Since 2007, the US has won defence orders from India worth $17 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.India is preparing to test an anti-ship version of the seeker sometime in October-November this year, Mishra said. A successful second test would allow it to go into production soon after.Hypersonic DevelopmentIn the next five years BrahMos Aerospace plans to develop the hypersonic BrahMos missile that can achieve speeds of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, Mishra said. The Indian-Russian joint venture is working on overcoming the technological challenges involved in achieving hypersonic speeds for the present Mach 2.8 missile.BrahMos is also working to extend the missile’s range to 800 km, he said, without giving a time frame. In March 2017, after India formally joined the international Missile Technology Control Regime, BrahMos successfully tested an extended range of 400 km for the missile.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-moves-to-reduce-its-reliance-on-russias-defence-imports/articleshow/63757492.cms
2018-04-16,"MUMBAI: Lenders to Alok Industries have rejected a revised offer by Reliance Industries-JM Financial ARC to acquire the bankrupt company, implying that the borrower may head into liquidation, banks must make 100% provisions against advances, and hundreds of employees could lose jobs.Only 70% of the lenders endorsed the revised all-cash offer of Rs 5,050 crore, which was just about Rs 100 crore higher than the previous offer, said two senior officials who did not want to be named. For a resolution plan to be accepted, at least 75% of the lenders have to vote in its favour.Reliance Industries, in partnership with J M Financial ARC, was the sole bidder for the bankrupt company that is facing claims of Rs 29,500 crore from financial creditors.This is the second time that lenders have rejected the Reliance–JM Financial ARC offer on the ground that it is very low. At first, the bidder offered Rs 4,950 crore, which was rejected by 30% of the lenders by value. Within 24 hours, Reliance-JM Financial ARC gave a revised offer and urged lenders to vote on it Friday evening.“In the second round, again 30% rejected it, implying that those who had rejected it earlier were not happy with the revised offer that increased the bid by just about Rs 100 crore,” said a senior official who did not want to be named.It appears that lenders such as IDBI Bank, Central Bank of India and Dena Bank were among those that voted against the offer, although their stands on the revised bid could not be independently verified with each bank.“The offer did not have any equity upside and was marginally above the liquidation value,” said a senior official when asked what may have prompted some lenders to vote against the resolution plan. The liquidation value of Alok Industries stands at Rs 4,200 crore. The revised offer may have implied a haircut of 83%.The 270-day deadline before which lenders have to finalise a resolution plan ended on April 14, a Saturday. Therefore, the resolution professional (RP) had decided to submit the resolution plan to the bankruptcy court on Monday, April 16, said senior officials. Now that the proposal has not been accepted, the RP is likely to propose that the company be sold as a going concern.Alok Industries is one of the few companies wherein the RP has called for a resolution plan several times after the borrower was admitted for bankruptcy. In March alone, the RP invited binding bids twice. The RP had set a deadline of March 13 when it received just one bid from JM Financial ARC.However, lenders had rejected it since JM Financial ARC did not disclose the name of its strategic partner in the documents. Lenders felt that the bidder must comply with Section 29(A), which bars defaulters from bidding on a resolution plan and, therefore, the names of strategic partners have to be disclosed for them to take a decision on a bid. The second round of bidding concluded on March 27, where JM Financial ARC disclosed that Reliance Industries was its partner in the bid.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/alok-lenders-reject-reliance-industries-jm-financial-arcs-revised-offer/articleshow/63777381.cms

2018-04-16,"MUMBAI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed till April 18 an insolvency tribunal order that allowed a Reliance Communications unit to sell its towers and fibre assets, temporarily halting the troubled telco’s attempt to pare debt, causing its shares to fall over 5%.The apex court stayed National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) interim order after hearing arguments by HSBC Daisy Investments and some other minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel, RCom’s tower unit, on how they will get hurt if the tower firm’s assets are sold to a third party.On April 18, NCLAT will hear the case on Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infratel's assets sale to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm and on allocation of proceeds.The tribunal had last week allowed State Bank of India (SBI)-led lenders to sell any of the mortgaged assets of RCom to a third party. It, however, had directed that the funds be kept in an escrow account till the final ruling, expected on Wednesday.HSBC Daisy-led minority shareholders, who have just over 4% stake in Reliance Infratel, challenged the ruling in Supreme Court, arguing that SBI-led lenders had no locus to sell Reliance Infratel assets. “They (the lenders) did not even file an appeal to NCLAT. So, how was an order passed allowing them to carry on asset sale?” a lawyer said, highlighting HSBC Daisy’s arguments.RCom shares dropped 5.38% to close at Rs 21.10 apiece on the BSE on Monday, when the benchmark indices ended up marginally positive. The company had shut its wireless operations last year.The Supreme Court decision, while stalling sale of towers and fibre housed under Reliance Infratel for a couple of days, doesn’t affect sale of RCom’s other assets such as spectrum, real estate and switching nodes, which were cleared by the top court last week.“RCom remains confident of completion of its asset monetisation programme of approx Rs 25,000 crore within the next few weeks, in the best interests of its secured lenders,” the telco said in a notice to the stock exchanges on Monday.In a bid to repay its 35 lenders, including SBI, and pare its Rs 45,000 crore debt, RCom had in December signed a pact to sell its wireless assets, including spectrum, nodes and tower and optic fibre assets, to Reliance Jio for about Rs 24,000 crore. The towers and optic fibre assets were valued at Rs 8,000 crore, with towers and land accounting for Rs 5,000 crore.But, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) stayed the sale of towers and fibre till further orders after a challenge by the minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel on grounds their consent was not sought for the asset sale. They told NCLT last month that, if allowed, the sale would be an “oppression of a minority shareholder under Sections 397 and 398” of the Companies Act, as Reliance Infratel would become defunct.RCom and its units then moved the Supreme Court to clear the sale. The apex court in turn asked the company and its units to move NCLAT as per procedure to get the stay on sale of towers and fibre vacated.The telco immediately moved NCLAT, which in turn allowed sale with the condition that the funds be kept in an escrow account till April 18.“NCLAT may determine the allocation, if any, of the sale proceeds to minority shareholders claiming an interest of approx 4% therein,” RCom said in its notice.Based on legal advice, the company believes the claim of minority investors in the tower and fibre proceeds, which is disputed by RCom, can at best be Rs 200 - 300 crore, it said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/supreme-court-stays-nclat-order-that-allowed-reliance-communication-to-sell-tower-assets/articleshow/63781818.cms

In October 2017 study, India’s market leader also rated top in both 4G and 3G speeds, and demonstrated an average LTE downloads of 9.2 Mbps and 3G downloads of 3.6 Mbps on its networks.The study revealed that the new comer Jio was still ahead of key rivals in 4G availability, beating the three— Airtel, Vodafone and Idea by at least 27% points in measurements.While Airtel demonstrates higher speed, it lags furthest behind on network coverage (66%), behind Jio (96%), Vodafone (68%) and Idea (68%), the OpenSignal said.Our testers were able to find an LTE signal on Jio's network 96.4% of the time in our latest test period, up from 95.6% in our October report, the mapping firm added.OpenSignal’s findings were based on a 736,571 devices test from a period ranging from December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.In a course of six months, the firm said that the telecom service providers have gone to great lengths to expand their 4G services reach and recorded a surge in 4G availability metric by Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India.The firm, however, said that in the coming quarters, the challenge for incumbents would be to match new player Reliance Jio’s capacity and the coverage, as they continue their acquisition spree in the Indian telecom market.The new findings also revealed that India has moved to 85% in LTE availability and joined high-performing 4G countries like Sweden, Taiwan and Australia.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/bharti-airtel-beats-reliance-jio-in-4g-speeds-opensignal/articleshow/63811277.cms

2018-04-24,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries, the country’s second-most valuable company, is being seen as the next likely candidate from India for the $100-billion market-cap club after Tata Consultancy Services.The oil and gas-to-telecom behemoth had first crossed the $100-billion market-cap mark in October 2007 when the rupee was at 39.5 to a dollar. In rupee terms, the company’s market capitalisation then stood at Rs 4.11 lakh crore.Reliance shares need to gain 11 per cent from the current levels (with the rupee at 66.48 against the dollar) for the company’s market value to revisit the $100-billion mark. Its market cap as of close on Monday stood at Rs 5.9 lakh crore, or $89.1 billion. The stock ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 935.15 on Monday.Analysts are betting that the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company could possibly re-enter the $100 billion club this year itself.“It is likely to be the second company in 2018 to hit the $100 billion market cap. If crude continues to be high, the company’s GRMs will be strong. Jio is also making inroads in the telecom business,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets & corporate affairs at IIFL.In the December quarter, the company had posted its highest ever quarterly consolidated net profit of Rs 9,423 crore, up 25.1 per cent from a year ago. The company is set to report result for the quarter ended March on Friday.“On the petchem side, Reliance Industries’ margins are at higher levels and are expected to remain high in the near to medium term. Volume growth will come as most of the capacity expansion is over,” said Sudeep Anand, analyst at IDBI Capital Market & Securities.“If the run rate of subscriber addition and data usage continue to be on uptrend, Jio’s profitability is likely to improve,” said Anand.The RIL stock last year broke free from its seven-year trend of underperformance versus the benchmark and surged 70.5 per cent, compared to the near 30 per cent gain in the Sensex during the same period.Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president at BOB Capital Markets, believes Jio’s performance will be key for RIL going ahead.“The key for them will be Jio. The telecom venture is gaining market share fast. Incremental market cap should be driven by re-rating of Jio,” said Ahuja. “At 9.5 times FY20 earnings and 12.5 times FY20 earnings, the stock is at a discount to market PE of 17 times. We see fair value of the stock at Rs 1,245,” added Ahuja. He expects the company to post a consolidated EPS of Rs 98 mainly driven by Jio’s profitability.Bloomberg data showed 30 of 39 analysts tracking the company have a ‘buy’ rating with a consensus target price of Rs 1,038.2.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-stock-needs-to-gain-only-11-to-regain-100-b-tag/articleshow/63889184.cms

2018-04-24,"Reliance Jio Infocomm filed a contempt petition in the Delhi High Court against Bharti Airtel, alleging that the rival’s caveat in its Indian Premier League-related advertisements was insufficient. The court will hear the matter on April 27.Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio had moved the court against Sunil Mittal-controlled rival earlier this month, contending that Airtel’s campaign suggested subscribers could live-stream the ongoing IPL cricket matches free, without mentioning that they would incur data charges. The court then directed Airtel to make some modifications to its campaign.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Jio, told the court on Tuesday that the disclaimers were not legible, not audible and/or not there at all.He urged the court to act urgently since the entire window of the campaign was limited to 51 days — the cricket tournament that started on April 7 will end on May 27.Jio, the newest telecom operator in India, had alleged earlier that the advertisements were deceptive and “aimed at enticing and luring viewers” to subscribe to Airtel’s service and give preference to the telco over other operators, including Jio.Senior counsel P Chidambaram, appearing for Airtel, said the operator had modified the advertisements and complied with the earlier order. The counsel added that the company had also filed an affidavit stating this.The Delhi High Court asked Airtel to provide the affidavit, file a reply to Jio’s contempt allegations and decided to take up the matter on April 27.An Airtel spokesperson termed Jio’s allegations as “false and frivolous” and said the court had given it time to submit a reply to the allegations. “We have already filed an affidavit of compliance in the Court on April 23, 2018.

They have rolled out advertisements and content-driven partnerships to get maximum attention, including a tie-up with Hotstar for live coverage.Until last year, IPL was streamed on digital platform Hotstar with a 5-minute lag, but this year, it is available live. Airtel and Jio have ensured that their users do not have to pay any subscription fee if they downloaded the Hotstar app.The telcos have sparred over advertisement claims before as well.

2018-04-25,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries subsidiary Reliance Brands, which sells luxury labels such as Ermenegildo Zegna, Bally and Brooks Brothers in India, is said to have reached out to nearly half a dozen Indian designers for a potential stake in their businesses, people familiar with the matter told ET.Reliance Brands reached out to Raghavendra Rathore, Rajesh Pratap Singh among other designers to explore the possibility of investing in their businesses, said sources familiar with the developments.Darshan Mehta, CEO of Reliance Brands, did not respond to calls seeking comments. He also did not revert to an ET questionnaire till the time of going to press.“There has been some mutual exchange of ideas with a few parties that we could align with -- as you may appreciate, this is an ongoing process and if we align our thoughts with a common vision, and if all stakeholders see the value in that, only then, can one proceed to discussing such possibilities,” said Rathore.He said his business has a lot of potential for both bespoke wear and retail in the menswear arena because of the DNA of the brand, which permits it to be independent from the dictates of fashion cycles. “Yes, we would be open to seeking external investment just as we have done for the Gurukul School of Design, that we have set up in Jaipur,” Rathore said.A spokesperson for Rajesh Pratap Singh confirmed being approached by Reliance Brands, but said it was a long time ago. “At this juncture, it would be important for us to look at not just a partner for investment in the business but also someone who would be a strategic fit for our growth, and more importantly, someone who understands our brand philosophy,” the spokesperson said.ET could not independently verify the other designers that were reached out to. In a response to ET’s queries, designer Rohit Bal denied being approached by Reliance Brands.Management consulting firm Technopak estimated that the fashion retail market, worth $46 billion in 2017, will grow at a promising CAGR of 9.7% to reach $115 billion by 2026.Reliance Brands has been eyeing a bigger share of the luxury market. In September last year, it bought L Catterton Asia’s 40% stake in Genesis Luxury, its direct competitor in luxury retail. It had also inked a deal in June last year with Italian brand Valentino to bring the brand to India.The other brands in Reliance Brands’ portfolio include Amsterdam-based fashion brand Scotch & Soda and Kate Spade New York.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-brands-keen-to-invest-in-businesses-of-top-indian-designers/articleshow/63916854.cms
2018-04-26,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed Reliance Communications to pay spectrum liabilities of Rs 774 crore to the telecom department by May 2 after the Anil Ambani-owned operator moved the apex court last week seeking more time clear dues and banks agreed to shell out the amount.RCom told the court it was willing to make payment but required more time, which the telecom department opposed on the grounds that the company was delaying the instalment for spectrum that was due on April 20, said lawyers aware of the development. “RCom has been given a week’s time from today to make the payment,” one of the lawyers present in court said. The telco’s shares fell 1.4% to close at Rs 17.70 on the BSE on Wednesday. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had refused to grant an extension to the struggling carrier, which shut down its voice services last year, to pay the instalment due for spectrum auctioned in 2013 and 2015.Lenders led by State Bank of India had agreed to pay the amount for RCom so that no further litigation prevents or delays the sale of the company’s wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm. Proceeds of the sale, amounting to almost Rs 25,000 crore, will be used to pare RCom’s debt of about Rs 45,000 crore.SBI wrote to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India that it would pay on behalf of RCom and that the case should be put to rest.The DoT holds bank guarantees for all deferred spectrum charges.It has the right to forfeit spectrum or cellular licence if a payment is missed. RCom didn’t comment on the matter as of press time Wednesday.RCom has been trying to sell its wireless assets including towers, fibre, spectrum and switching nodes to Reliance Jio and wants to sell its real estate assets - a majority in the Navi Mumbai-based Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City - as well to further pare its debt to about Rs 6,000 crore.While the courts have allowed the sale of spectrum and switching nodes to Jio, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal barred the company from selling the tower and fibre assets as of now.

2018-04-26,"MUMBAI: A consortium of 30 lenders to Reliance Communications, led by State Bank of India, has urged the bankruptcy court to dismiss Ericsson’s insolvency petition against the telco, saying its Rs18,000 crore asset sale to Reliance Jio was critical to all parties.“Do not admit the matter,” Fredun De Vitre, senior counsel who represented the 30 lenders waiting to recover their dues from Reliance Communications (RCom) through asset monetisation, told the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). “The process (sale of assets) is in progress and stalling the sale will adversely affect everyone. If the sale happens, Rs 18,000 crore will come into the company (RCom) which has a debt of about Rs 40,000 crore,” he said.In a bid to speed up the asset sale, RCom’s lenders recently also agreed to pay the Rs 774 crore that the telco owes the department of telecommunications (DoT).The Supreme Court had on Wednesday asked RCom to pay DoT by May 2.Bringing this up before NCLT, Ericsson’s counsel said if the bankers did not want insolvency petition accepted then they should pay RCom’s due amount to the vendor as well.“The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Clause (IBC) petition has been pending for long and there has been no settlement from RCom till now,” senior counsel Anil Kher and Pessy Modi told NCLT on behalf of Ericsson. “They have admitted their liabilities but said we will get zero.”RCom has been fighting a legal tussle with Ericsson since last September. The telecom equipment maker alleges that the Anil Ambani-owned operator owes it Rs 1,012 crore.The bench, comprising B S V Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy, asked counsel representing the 30 lenders to file an intervention petition and adjourned the matter for hearing for May 4.Shares of RCom dropped 5.1% to close at Rs 16.80 a piece on the BSE on Thursday, when the benchmark indices ended up marginally positive. The company had shut its wireless operations last year.RCom had in December last year signed a pact to sell its towers, fibre, spectrum and switching nodes to Jio.Ericsson’s counsel alleged before NCLT that RCom’s deal with Jio was a private arrangement, which SBI’s counsel vehemently denied.“The assets are being bought by one of the largest conglomerates (Jio) in India whose bid was 25% higher than the second offer,” said De Vitre. Earlier, court proceedings revealed that Bharti Airtel was the second highest bidder for the tower assets with an offer 25% lower than Jio’s.Senior counsel Navroz Seervai represented the Anil Ambani-owned company and its units.Last month, Ericsson got an arbitration tribunal order preventing the transfer of the telco’s assets till further permission. RCom approached the Bombay High Court against the tribunal’s order, but its appeal was dismissed. The telco then moved the Supreme Court, which allowed sale of assets but not the towers till clearance from National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).RCom is in a separate legal battle with HSBC Daisy Investments and other minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel, the tower unit of RCom, who opposed the sale of towers, alleging that it will lead to oppression of minority shareholders.NCLAT will hear the case on May 2.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-led-lenders-ask-nclt-to-dismiss-ericsson-insolvency-plea-against-reliance-communications/articleshow/63931506.cms
2018-04-27,"Reliance Industries is likely to post 13th straight sequential increase in the standalone net profit when it declares results for the March quarter on Friday. Higher profitability of the petrochemical segment and stable gross refining margin will drive growth. Jio’s performance will also be crucial given aggressive tariffs and discounts since January.The standalone net profit, which mainly includes the refining and petrochemicals businesses, is expected to be Rs 8,922 crore, according to Bloomberg estimate. The net profit of the consolidated operations, which encompass the traditional segments as well as interests in media, retail, and telecom, is likely to increase by 16 per cent year-on-year to Rs 9,347 crore.A better performance by the petrochemicals segment due to full benefit of the recently commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (RoGC) plant will help in offsetting the impact of moderation in the refining business. Operating profit (EBIT) of the petrochemical segment is expected to increase 85 per cent year-on-year to Rs 6,450 crore in the March 2018 quarter. The prices of the petrochemical products such as Polyethylene, Polypropylene, PoY and PSF rose 2-12 per cent in rupee terms in the March quarter from the year ago.The oil refining business, on the other hand, may see some moderation due to softening of the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) — a gauge for regional refining margins. GRM is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products. The Singapore GRM dropped by $0.2 from the previous quarter to $7.0 per barrel in the March quarter as the realisation on petrol dropped.RIL’s GRM is expected to drop by $0.3 sequentially to $11.3 per barrel in the March quarter. The premium of RIL’s GRM over the Singapore GRM is expected to fall marginally to $4.3 per barrel in the March quarter from $4.4 in the previous quarter. The premium of the RIL’s GRM may narrow as the official selling price (OSP) of the Saudi Arabia crude oil has increased in the March quarter thereby narrowing the Brent-Dubai crude differential. This may put pressure on the realisation of complex refiners such as RIL’s. The refinery volume is expected to remain flat compared with the previous quarter. The operating profit of the refining segment may drop by 8.5 per cent to Rs 5,680 crore from the year ago.The telecom division, which turned positive at the EBIT level in the September quarter is expected to report a net profit of Rs 400-500 crore for the March quarter. The operating profit (EBIT) of Jio is likely to be similar to that in the previous quarter due to fall in ARPU. It may drop to Rs 140 from Rs 154 in December quarter.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/petrochem-growth-stable-grm-to-pump-it-up-for-ril/articleshow/63933550.cms

2018-04-27,"HYDERABAD: A visible culture change is taking place at India’s largest private sector company, Reliance Industries (RIL). Not only has the energy-to-education enterprise provided flexible working hours to employees, it has also extended maternity benefits, allowing women to work half-day for a few months after maternity leave. RIL, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is getting younger with average age reducing and there is no diktat on formal dressing at work either. What’s more, over the last couple of years, sporting facilities such as a cricket stadium, a football and basketball ground have come up at its Navi Mumbai campus, while the canteen there boasts of around 16 different cuisines. These facilities are being utilised by employees throughout the day, indicating that they are taking charge of their work-life balance on working days. On weekends, the campus is thrown open to the families of employees.In an exclusive interview to TOI, RIL’s HR leads — Ashwani Prashara (hydrocarbons), and Sanjay Jog (Jio) — said the culture change is about responding to the needs of young employees. Jog said, “Our campus looks like a college campus. Is it a change which is cultural? It is. The important thing is not that the facilities are present, but that they are being consumed any time of the day. A gymnasium is not being consumed only in the morning before work or after work, it is being used all day.”RIL’s disruptive entry into consumer-facing businesses like telecom (Jio) could have played a role in accelerating these changes. What is also said to be a driving factor is Gen Next leaders — Akash and Isha Ambani.Jog, however, junks the argument that it is merely the consumer businesses that are bringing about the change. “The core group for executing retail and telecom came from the hydrocarbons businesses, because they understand the DNA of the group,” he added. According to Prashara, with the whole ecosystem changing, it’s about the flexibility to change with the changing times. “People demand flexible timings and the trigger was not retail or Jio, it was the need that was there and we moved to provide flexible timings. People choose to come in at any time of the day, while sticking to core hours,” Prashara said.The $51-billion RIL still draws a significant chunk of its turnover from refining and petrochemicals, but in terms of people strength, its consumer-facing business now contributes more than 50%. The strength of the consumer-facing businesses (telecom and retail) would only increase further. Jio’s current employee strength is over 1.50 lakh. “Turnover wise, the traditional businesses are big. But you need to view a business through people actually. People-wise, retail and Jio are big,” Prashara said.The average age of employees at RIL too has come down. The average age in retail and telecom is 27-28 years, while in the non-consumer facing side it is 32. Jog said, “To me, 32 itself is a significant change. It would have been higher earlier.”Prashara said, “The opportunity canvases have increased. Newer people are coming in and there are newer areas and avenues. People are aspirational, looking at growing, and if you don’t provide them the opportunities, you can’t hold them. As an organisation, the way we have grown is by betting on our people talent and capability.”The top executives from RIL’s HR division were in Hyderabad at the SHRM Tech conference, which RIL is partnering. Reliance’s presence at SHRM was a surprise to many. The group has not spoken at length about its people processes. The stress on digital, however, is not restricted to the new-age businesses of RIL. Manufacturing is going to be tech- and AI-driven as well. “We are passionate about two things. One is digital world, and the other is people. Both these need to go hand in hand to ensure that, as we get on with these, we don’t lose either in the process. That’s where it’s becoming that much more important to start getting into tech, and we are also convinced about the fact that digital is the new life, as our chairman calls it,” Prashara said.“The context is simple. The earlier workforce that was coming in had to learn from word processing to power point to excel — which at that time were the high-end technical skills in the people world. Now, the millennials are completely up the curve. Organisations are having to catch up to cater to what they want from a needs stand point, because millennials are already far ahead of the curve and very adaptable and flexible,” Prashara said.Given the scale of RIL, the HR teams are leveraging synergies across platforms. So, while the hiring and on-boarding platform was copied by retail and Jio from what existed in the hydrocarbons business, the latter is now borrowing the learning and development platforms from retail and telecom businesses. Though numbers are not available for RIL, there has been a significant shift in the needle on gender diversity as well. At Jio, women form around 30% of the total strength. Jog said, “When you are in 6,000 talukas in India, traditionally women who did not migrate earlier do not have to do so now. The opportunity set has increased. That’s another reason why the intake is a little more, particularly of women engineers. Our presence in small towns changes the whole dynamic.”Like some of the global organisations that have shunned the bell curve, RIL is only using it as a guideline, not as a mandate. The company has also moved from a six-day work week to a five-day one. The management said that providing flexibility at work has not compromised on productivity. “You don’t need a structure to say it’s a five-day week or a six-day work week. People by choice do so,” said Jog.What drives productivity, said Prashara, is employee engagement. “If you are engaged, you will put your heart and soul into it,” he said. So when Jio was in building stage, people wanted to be part of the excitement. When they worked, it didn’t matter for how many hours in a day or days in a week. Jog said, “Same would have been the energy when Jamnagar refinery was being set up.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-industries-ushers-in-cultural-change-with-hr-moves/articleshow/63937219.cms
2018-04-27,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries (RIL) on Friday reported Rs 9,435 crore consolidated profit for the March quarter, its highest quarterly profit. The energy-to-telecom conglomerate, led by India's richest businessman Mukesh Ambani, logged 17.26 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit and beat a Rs 9,350 crore estimate that some analysts had projected in an ETNow poll. The profit figure stood at Rs 8,046 crore in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated sales for the quarter rose 29.34 per cent YoY to Rs 1.2 lakh crore from Rs 92,889 crore in the year-ago period. In sales, the company had earlier set a record of Rs 1,18,038 crore in the December quarter of 2013, data compiled from corporate database Capitaline showed. The numbers were aided by a strong performance in the petrochemical segment, which gained on higher volumes on account of a ramp-up of the recently commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (ROCG) and petchem expansion projects. The world's largest ROCG at Jamnagar with a capacity of 1.5 mmtpa, along with downstream plants and utilities, was commissioned on January 2 this year. In a statement, the company said the surge in revenue was primarily because of a volume increase with the commissioning of petrochemical projects and oil price-induced jump in realisations for refining and petrochemical products. ""The increase in consolidated revenues reflects robust growth of 134 per cent in retail business and continuing growth momentum in wireless subscriber additions for Digital Services business,"" it added. Petrochemical margin, meanwhile, fell to 16.9 per cent in March qua Gross refining margin (GRM) for the quarter came off a bit at $11 per barrel from $11.5 in the March quarter last year and $11.6 in the December quarter. Most analysts had estimated March quarter GRM in the $11-11.4 range. GRM at $11/bbl for the quarter outperformed Singapore complex refining margins by $4/bbl. Gross refining margin (GRM) for the quarter came off a bit at $11 per barrel from $11.5 in the March quarter last year and $11.6 in the December quarter.

2018-04-28,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries’ quarterly net profit rose 17.3% to Rs 9,435 crore as the conglomerate turned a new leaf, with its booming petrochemicals business delivering higher earnings than refining for the first time in a decade while the newer retail and telecom ventures grew briskly in the improved economic environment.Consolidated turnover in March quarter rose 39% to Rs 1,29,120 crore, driven by higher oil prices and production and commissioning of new petrochemicals projects. The conglomerate’s new businesses made healthy contributions to its performance. Organised retail revenue rose 134% to Rs 24,183 crore while operating profit jumped 291% to Rs 951 crore, reflecting much higher operating margins from its operations across 3,837 stores in 750 cities.Its disruptive telecom business continued to expand aggressively and reported its second consecutive quarterly profit as it lured another 26.5 million customers with tariffs that its rivals blame for their plunging performance. Reliance Jio Infocomm reported a standalone net profit of Rs 510 crore on operating revenue of Rs 7,128 crore.Consolidated net profit rose 20.6% to Rs 36,075 crore while turnover rose 30.5% to Rs 4,30,731 crore in the full fiscal year FY18, which chairman Mukesh Ambani said was a landmark year for the firm’s operations and performance including the strong foundations RIL has built in the retail and digital services.Refining margins to stay firm “The growing Indian market provides exciting opportunities to scale up these businesses and maximise long-term shareholder value in the coming years,” Ambani said.Revenue from its refining and marketing business rose 28.8% to Rs 93,519 crore as its Jamnagar refinery, the world’s largest, earned $11 from every barrel it processed. The refining margin was much higher than its global peers, but slightly lower than $11.5 it reported in the same quarter last year. The segment’s operating profit was 10.9% lower at Rs 5,607 crore, which was also due to lower crude processing because of a planned maintenance shutdown. The company said refining margins in Asia were likely to remain firm in the near term.“The volatility in the market is expected to continue in the coming quarters but we feel the GRMs (gross refining margins) still look constructive,” V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer, told reporters.Exports of refined products rose to $6.3 billion from $5.1 billion in the same quarter last fiscal year.The petrochemicals business reported an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of 87% at Rs 6,435 crore, making the operating profit higher than the refining and marketing operations’ EBIT of Rs 5,607 crore. Petrochemicals revenue rose 44% to Rs 38,113 crore.Srikanth said RIL’s investment in the petrochemicals business is complete and capacities are now fully operational.“The volumes in the fourth quarter were good and we ended the whole year with 31million tonnes output. At this level of production, we would have around 35 million tonnes in FY19,” he told reporters.He was optimistic about the business. “Petrochemicals has done well driven by higher volume and better margins; this improved in the fourth quarter and should continue in the new financial year”, he said.Sharekhan research analyst Abhijeet Bora said net profit was marginally higher than estimates. “We believe that the recent surge in oil prices would improve the economics of RIL’s petcoke gassification project, which in turn would benefit refining margins.We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating on RIL,” he said.Reliance Industries’ shares closed up 2% at Rs 994.75 on the BSE before the company announced its earnings.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-profit-rises-17-3-in-q4-petrochemicals-outshines-refining/articleshow/63946905.cms
2018-04-28,"Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s net profit rose 1.2% in the March quarter from the preceding one, its second straight quarter in the black, helped by strong user additions despite average revenue per user (ARPU) dropping due mainly to the sharp cut in its base offer to JioPhone users.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company, which has upended the market since its entry in September 2016 first with free voice and data and now much cheaper mobile Internet services, has posted a net profit of Rs 510 crore compared with Rs 504 crore in the October-December period. Revenue rose 3.6% sequentially to Rs 7,128 crore. Voice calls are still free.India’s fourth-largest telco by user base started reporting results from the three-month period ended September when it posted a loss of Rs 271 crore. This compares with the first net loss for Bharti Airtel’s India operations in nearly 15 years in the January-March period.Idea is expected to widen its fourth-quarter net loss when it reports on April 28. For the full year, Jio posted a net profit of Rs 723 crore on revenue of Rs 20,154 crore.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) amounted to Rs 6,734 crore while the ebitda margin was 33.4%. “The strong financial results of Jio in a competitive market environment demonstrates the robustness of the Jio business model and ability to offer the most value to our customers and partners,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman, Reliance Industries, Jio’s parent. “Jio has demonstrated that it can scale and sustain its strong financial performance.”FALL IN ARPU The new telecom entrant’s average revenue per user (ARPU)—a key performance parameter—fell to Rs 137.1 from Rs 154 in the third quarter. Ebitda for the quarter was Rs 2,694, up 2.5% sequentially.Jio’s performance came a few days after market leader Bharti Airtel reported a Rs 652-crore net loss for its India business, before exceptional items, hurt by cuts in international termination rates interconnection usage charges, besides the ongoing price war. Revenue fell 13% with ARPU at Rs 116, its lowest ever.Anshuman Thakur, Jio’s head of strategy and planning, told reporters that the company’s accounting was in line with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind-AS).Some analysts had said the company had been able to declare a profit in the third quarter by keeping costs low thanks to the unit-of-production method of accounting.They had also pointed out that Jio had accounted for six months of revenue in the three months to December.“Revenues are recognised as and when services are provided,” Thakur said. “The tariff plan clearly mentions that the revenues would be recognised in the last month of the first recharge cycle, and now all our current revenues are for the quarter, so when they recharge we render the service and we recognise the revenue.”The accounting method may colour perceptions, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president, markets and corporate affairs, IIFL.“But still, with ebitda positive and ARPU at Rs 137, Jio is clearly an outperformer,” he said. “Against Rs 116, which is the lowest I have seenin so many quarters, from the country's largest operator Bharti, they've got an upside of 17-18%.” He added that the just-ended quarter had been the worst as far as pricing goes, but Jio still enjoys a lead on ARPU, despite this falling on quarter.“ARPU dip was the result of the price action that happened earlier on in the quarter. It was around Rs 50 reduction in tariff plans that has been impact on ARPU, but we have been more than able to make up on it through the subscriber goal,” said Thakur.He was referring to the cut in its base offer to JioPhone users to Rs 49 from Rs 90, to attract more users to its network.The quarterly ebitda margin though contracted to 37.8% compared with 38.2% in the preceding one, on higher costs and muted revenue growth. Airtel, in comparison, had a margin of 28.4% for its India mobile services business.Network operating expenses were around Rs 1,812 crore, compared with nearly Rs 1,737 crore in the third quarter, while depreciation and amortisation costs rose to Rs 1,199 crore from Rs 1,193 crore. Total expenses rose to Rs 6,345 crore from Rs 6,109 crore.SUBSCRIBER ADDITIONJio, which added a net 26.5 million subscribers to end March with 186.6 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network that have more users, and is thus a net payer of interconnection usage charges (IUC), which were reduced by the telecom regulator by 57% from October 1. In the latest quarter, Jio paid nearly Rs 1,065.9 crore as IUC, compared with Rs 1,082 crore in the preceding one. The company had paid nearly Rs 2,140 crore in the July-September quarter.Total wireless data traffic in the quarter was 5.06 billion GB, up 14% on quarter and much higher than its more established rivals such as Bharti Airtel, which recorded around 1.5 billion GB.Average data consumption per user per month was 9.7 GB while average voice traffic was 716 minutes per user per month.Airtel, in comparison, recorded 670 minutes per user, while data usage per subscriber was 6.6 GB. Jio saw 0.25% of users moving to another network, compared with Airtel’s 2.8%.Debt stood at Rs 57,000 crore, on an equity base of over Rs 1.02 lakh crore.The company recorded capex of about Rs 14,000 crore in the March quarter, compared with Rs 7,000 crore in the third quarter.“This spurt has been because we are completing our wireless network and deliveries happened in this quarter. We will cover 99% of the population this year,” said Thakur.Jio inked a pact to buy spectrum, fibre, towers and nodes from Reliance Communications and its affiliates in an all-cash deal for Rs 18,000 crore in December, but the deal closure, expected by March end, has been delayed due to cases against the Anil Ambani-owned telco. “Yes, it has taken a bit longer because of all lawsuits,” Thakur said.“We can watch from the sidelines. Most of the other conditions precedence for closing the transactions have been made, but till such time that there is clarity on legal front, we cannot go ahead and close the transaction.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-earns-black-belt-once-again-posts-net-profit-of-rs-510-crore-in-march-quarter/articleshow/63946956.cms
2018-04-28,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Investors in Reliance Industries (RIL), India’s biggest private company by profit, will likely watch one key metric while assessing Jio’s future valuations: Its return on capital employed (RoCE).The telecom arm of the company owned by India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has been at the vanguard of a data revolution in the country, playing a leading role in the re-rating of the Reliance stock over the past couple of years. Jio’s price and capacity-driven strategy to gain revenue market share has forced a consolidation in the telecom industry, making meaningful data packs affordable to millions of Indians.In the March 2018 quarter, the average revenue per user (ARPU) of Jio was Rs 137, compared with Rs 154 in the previous quarter, while the subscriber base at the Mumbai-based company rose to 186 million from 160 million in the three months.According to estimates by Kotak Institutional Equities, Reliance Jio had an RoCE of 1.1 per cent in FY18, and it is expected to jump to 8.9 per cent in FY23, with an upward traction in ARPU visible from 2020. For now, however, ARPUs across the industry may remain subdued, declining 12 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in FY 18 and FY19.Jio’s rival Bharti Airtel has also talked about lower competitive intensity. In the post-earnings call, the Airtel management said that while the downtrend in ARPU continues, the worst may be over and the key topline metric for the industry may recover in the long term.The telecom venture of Reliance has been posting positive operating profit in the past three quarters and had a profit of Rs 723 crore in FY18. It uses the unit of production (UoP) accounting method to compute depreciation, analysts say. Not conventionally used by telecom companies, UoP requires costs to be amortised based on cumulative production over the economic life and, analysts say, is traditionally used in sectors with finite resources such as oil and gas.At Jio, depreciation will be computed on the basis of network utilisation. By contrast, other telecom companies use the straight-line method to compute depreciation. Final profit figures using the two methods would be different. Hence, the Street is looking closely at the RoCE to assess the future valuation of the telecom business.Separately, the scope for earnings surprises from the conventional business such as refining and petrochemicals is limited, with the Street already factoring in incremental growth due to the commissioning of new complex units such as the refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) and petcoke gasification.On the conventional business vertical, the petrochemical segment’s operating profit rose 87 per cent to Rs 6,435 crore due to higher volume of new paraxylene, recently commissioned ROGC plant and downstream units of PE and MEG. In the refining segment, RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) dropped to $11 per barrel from $11.6 in the December quarter due to adverse Brent-Dubai differential and lower crude throughput. The Street is pricing in GRM of $11-12 per barrel in the projected earnings for FY19 due to incremental gains from petcoke gasification unit.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-jio-adds-lustre-to-reliance-stock/articleshow/63948177.cms
2018-04-28,"Reliance Industries clocked record profits of Rs 9,435 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, up 17 per cent, on higher margins from its petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses. This indicates that RIL makes around Rs 105 crore a day. Higher earnings from petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses helped the company offset the lower contribution from the refining and oil & gas ventures. RIL’s consolidated profit was Rs 8,046 crore a year earlier.The digital services business, run under the Jio brand, posted a net profit of Rs 510 crore in Q4FY18. This is the second time in a row the telecom unit has declared a profit. RIL had launched the telecom services in September 2016. Jio is six times more profitable than Bharti Airtel, whose consolidated profit in Q4FY18 was Rs 83 crore. The digital services business posted an operating profit of Rs 1,495 crore compared to an operational loss of Rs 32 crore. Revenues of the business stood at Rs 8,421 crore in Q4FY18, helped by a 16 per cent rise in subscribers.RIL’s consolidated revenues climbed 39 per cent to Rs 1.29 lakh crore on strong volumes from its petrochemicals business due to newly commissioned projects and higher product prices, and a134 per cent surge in its retail business. For the full financial year 2017-18, RIL, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, recorded a profit of Rs 36,075 crore, an increase of 21 per cent while revenues were up by 31 per cent to Rs 4.3 lakh crore. Operating profit expanded nearly 34 per cent to Rs 74,184 crore ($11.4 billion).“FY 2017-18 was a landmark year for Reliance where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters. Reliance has become the first Indian company to record operating profit of over $10 billion with each of our key businesses — refining, petrochemicals, retail and digital services achieving recording earnings performance,” Ambani said in a statement.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-is-now-logging-rs-100-crore-profit-a-day-on-petchem-retail/articleshow/63948326.cms
2018-04-28,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail more than doubled revenue during the year ended March, becoming the first retailer in India to cross the $10 billion sales mark. At ₹69,198 crore, Reliance Retail’s revenue in the previous financial year exceeded the combined sales of rivals Future Group, Avenue Supermart, Shoppers Stop and Tata Trent.However, with the fuel retailing business also contributing a chunk of Reliance’s organised retail business, the numbers are not comparable with rivals that run food and grocery supermarkets and lifestyle department stores.“We have established strong foundations in retailing and digital services business with world-class supply chain management and network infrastructure which will serve our customers well,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, which operates 3,837 stores with an area of over 17.7 million square feet.“It is very heartening to see the traction our service offerings are gaining, with discerning Indian consumers. The growing Indian market provides exciting opportunities to scale-up these businesses and maximise long-term shareholder value in the coming years.”Reliance Retail’s profit before depreciation, interest, and taxes for the year grew 114% year-on-year to ₹2,529 crore.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-sales-cross-10-bn-mark/articleshow/63948867.cms
2018-04-28,"In an interview with ET Now, Sanjiv Bhasin, IIFL says ""My call is if not next week or next month, in the next three months, Reliance will be the next $100 billion company."" Edited excerpts:ET Now: The ARPU number for Jio is at Rs 134, which is very impressive if you compare it with Bharti. I am not sure how Reliance arrived at it given a lot of freebies being distributed with Jio plan. What’s your take?Sanjiv Bhasin: Bharti’s ARPU stood at Rs 116 this quarter. This is the lowest we have seen in last many quarters and Rs 134 is a substantial beat. Like you said there are a lot of freebies and how they are managing that is questionable but then again Rs 134 is a standout number. It shows that Jio business has turned Ebitda positive and over a period of time it will sustain given that cash infusion is there.ET Now: The valuation almost went to $100 billion, just Rs 40 shy of that. The stock has run 8% this week alone and now, 15.5% overall margins are lower than the Street's expectations. Petchem Ebitda is slightly on the lower side and refining Ebit softening. Do you think the stock could come under pressure when we open for trade on Monday?Sanjiv Bhasin: Reliance deserves to be in the $100 billion club. It may not happen next week and may happen probably by next month, but definitely it is on course.This quarter maybe slightly sluggish and there may be many reasons for that. It's not that oil has been high; there must have been inventory and other issues at work. The 15.5% margin is about 150 bps lower than what we were factoring in. My call is if not next week or next month, in the next three months, Reliance will be the next $100 billion company. If they maintain Rs 134 as ARPU, that means they are really showing a lot of strength.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-definitely-is-on-course-to-be-in-the-100-billion-club-sanjiv-bhasin-iifl/articleshow/63951222.cms

While some analysts expect a 16 per cent upside in the stock in the near future, some forecast 7 per cent downside, ET reported.The lender on Friday reported Rs 9,435 crore consolidated profit for the March quarter, its highest quarterly profit.The energy-to-telecom conglomerate led by India's richest businessman Mukesh Ambani, logged 17.26 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit and beat Rs 9,350 crore estimate that some analysts had projected in an ETNow poll. The profit figure stood at Rs 8,046 crore in the year-ago quarter.

2018-04-30,"Talking to ET Now, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC, though there was a revenue rundown in for R-Jio in this quarter, it was not bad in comparison with its competitors.Edited excerpts: We were talking about RIL joining the $100 billion market cap club but do you think Rel Jio can stall those plans? Reliance will do well and R-Jio will also do well. In this quarter, there was a revenue run rate slowdown for Jio, but if you look at the other telecom incumbents -- the competitors are not in a great shape in terms of their balance sheet and the leverage.Reliance is in a very strong position and the quality of service is as good or better depending upon the circle. Against this backdrop, a company which is holding on to its market share is more important. I would see that Jio will do well and as a result Reliance as a stock will also perform well. Its other businesses like petchem are doing extremely well and the stock overall does very well from here.With the exception of ICICI Bank, private banks have started rising and PSU banks have stopped falling, given that the Reserve Bank of India is aware that the provisioning norms will have an impact on bank’s balance sheets. Is a strong trade possible in an SBI, BoB or for that matter Union Bank?Two things. You just have to step back a little bit on the loan growth for corporate banks including ICICI and Axis is close to 0% -- there is no growth. On the other hand, for the retail banks, it is 15-17% which means there has not been any accretion to their bottom line.They are loss-making companies. As far as PSU banks are concerned, RBI has stepped in and allowed them to spread the losses a little bit for the following quarters. More than anything else, that depends on two factors. One, the 12 NCLT cases resolution and second, a large amount of kitchen sinking of the NPAs in this quarter and next. All this is well-known in the marketplace. Against this backdrop, as long as the new NPL formation slows down, the stocks will do well from here because the valuations are cheap.Do you also believe that ICICI Bank is perhaps a better bet than Axis right now?Both the stocks will continue to do well because they are facing very similar situations. Both are likely to see new CEOs. In the case of Axis, new CEO search has already begun. ICICI is probably going that way. Axis has kind of put out all its NPAs in this quarter. We hope ICICI will do the same but the June quarter will continue to be of the same trend and there will be more bad results. Against this backdrop, it is a question of who is the new CEO and whether the new CEO is growth oriented or not. In terms of bad news, as long as no new things emerge, pretty much all is known about the quality of the book.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-will-continue-to-do-very-well-from-here-chakri-lokapriya/articleshow/63968548.cms

2018-04-30,"The entry of online smartphone brands Xiaomi and Motorola into offline helped Mukesh Ambani’s consumer electronics and smartphone retailing business, Reliance Digital, enter the $2-billion league.According to two senior industry executives aware of the details, the business grew by 31% to reach Rs 15,100 crore, or about $2.3 billion, in the year ended March 2018 from Rs 11,480 crore in 2016-17.This performance excludes sales of Reliance Jio connections and recharges, which are done by Reliance Digital and smaller format Jio Stores that are part of the same business.While Reliance attributed the growth to “focused assortment and bringing online brands offline like Xiaomi and Moto (Motorola)” in an investor presentation of its Q4 earnings announced last Friday, industry analysts said competitive pricing and offers at par with top online marketplaces, Flipkart and Amazon, have driven sales at Reliance Digital.The company said its electronics retailing business continues to “outpace market growth across key product categories”.The business has more than 220 large format Reliance Digital stores and over 1,800 smaller format neighbourhood Jio stores, which also sell smartphones and do catalogue sales of television and appliances.With this, Reliance Digital is more than four times the size of its nearest rival, Croma chain of the Tata Group.While Croma’s financial performance for FY18 is yet to be declared, the business had clocked Rs 3,268 crore sales in 2016-17 as per latest regulatory filings to the Registrar of Companies. Reliance Digital had raced past Croma in sales in 2014-15.The earnings release and presentation did not reveal the annualised revenue break-up of the consumer electronics retailing businesEmailed queries sent to Reliance Retail on Saturday remained unanswered till Monday press time.An industry executive said Reliance Digital has been able to grow despite the return of deep online discounts in categories like smartphones and television during the last festive season and the introduction of the single levy goods and services tax (GST), which had impacted the industry.“Reliance Digital has grown not just in smartphones, but also in TVs and appliances, including its private label Reconnect. The revenue also includes the service business, which is currently small with 70 service centres but is poised to become a major driver going forward,” he said.Devangshu Dutta, CEO at Third Eyesight, a retail and consumer goods consulting company, said while margins are low in consumer electronics and smartphone segment, Reliance Retail is pushing volume sales, which would then make sense of margins in aggregate.“ For Reliance, the consumer electronics retailing business is quite strategic in pushing sales of digital devices like smartphones, connected TVs and appliances which in turn will drive Jio data consumption,” he said.Reliance Digital had become the largest contributor to Reliance Retail revenues in 2016-17, accounting for 34% of overall business by overtaking the grocery segment. It is also the country’s largest retailer of smartphones, televisions and white goods.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-digital-enters-the-2-billion-club/articleshow/63977896.cms
2018-04-30,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will endure more financial pain through FY19 with Reliance Jio Infocomm unlikely to slacken its pricing aggression in its bid to maximise customer acquisitions and close the gap with its rivals, analysts said.The price wars, they said, would continue as Jio is focussed on retaining and increasing its almost 187 million-strong subscriber base.“The price war will continue as (parent) Reliance Industries (RIL) is very firm about the strategy going forward on (telecom arm) Jio, which continues to be focused on customer acquisition and is open to further tariff cuts based on actions of incumbents,” BNP Paribas said in a note to clients seen by ET.Analysts at JP Morgan backed the view, saying, “Jio clearly wants to offer the most competitive tariffs and gain a higher subscriber share, and its core business cash flows are strong enough to support this strategy, especially as core project spending drops.”Jio’s future pricing strategy, according to the brokerage, could induce its financially stressed rivals to increase tariffs even though this could “effectively lead to a loss of market share.”What could be particularly worrisome for the telcos is that Jio believes “it can be profitable in the current tariff environment” and continue to invest, JP Morgan said.Last week, Jio Infocomm outclassed listed operators Airtel and Idea, reporting a 1.2% sequential growth in net profit to Rs 510 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 with higher average revenue per user and voice and data usage.Bharti Airtel shares rose 0.15% to Rs 409.55 at the close on the BSE on Monday, while Idea’s shares gained 0.36% after reporting a lower-than-expected Rs 930.6 crore net loss in the March quarter, helped by a reduction in costs and higher other income. The Reliance scrip fell 3.2% closing at Rs 963.10.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said the telecom industry is “unlikely to witness any tariff hike for the next 3-to-6 months at least” as it expects both “Jio and Bharti to focus on poaching customers” of the emerging Idea-Vodafone combined entity, which is widely expected to shed some revenue market share, post-merger.“Jio intends to keep its tariffs at a discount to peers, and we don’t see the company in a rush to raise ARPU as its primary focus remains on subscriber additions,” the US brokerage said in a note after Jio’s earnings call.For the country’s older telcos, Jio’s entry in September 2016 with its disruptive tariffs compelled them to respond, putting further pressure on their revenue and profit. This competition triggered consolidation in the sector.Brokerage Nomura International expects the pace of Jio’s subscriber additions to remain robust, given that “nearly three of every four new incremental 4G LTE phone buyers opt for Jio’s service and the pace of JioPhone additions remains strong too.”Analysts said Jio has indicated it will step up its activities around the fibre broadband and enterprise business fronts, with phased commercial rollouts likely soon.“Jio believes in the currently underserviced enterprise market, it could outplay rivals, given its strong data network,” BankAm-Merrill Lynch said.With Jio users spending close to an hour a day on average on their phones, the 4G telco sees an emerging “ad monetisation opportunity,” the US brokerage added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-jio-to-inflict-more-pain-to-bharti-airtel-vodafone-india-and-idea-cellular/articleshow/63978695.cms

Reliance Industries Ltd., incorporated in 1973, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 610169.40 crore.Outlook – Robust margin outlook for core businesses of refining and petchem; Telecom financials to improve with growth in revenue market share: We expect RIL to benefit from higher refining margin as the economics of its petcoke gasification project would improve given the recent surge in oil price. We highlight here that every $10/bbl increase in crude oil price could add $0.4/bbl to the GRM of RIL as a result of cost savings from the petcoke gasification plant. Moreover, recently commissioned downstream projects especially Refinery Off Gas Cracker (RoGC) have stablised and expected to benefit from the likely firming-up of propylene and MEG margins. We expect improvement in the financials of the telecom business, given our assumption of growth in RJIO’s revenue market share and improvement in margins on account of operating leverage.Valuation – Maintain Buy rating with unchanged PT of Rs. 1,110: We have fine tuned our FY2019 and FY2020 earnings estimates to factor in higher subscriber base and marginally lower APRU for the telecom business. We maintain our Buy rating on RIL with unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 1,110, as we remain positive on the earnings growth momentum (expect 13% EBITDA CAGR over FY2018-FY2020E) on account of the recently commissioned RoGC project and ramp-up of petcoke gasification project along with gradual improvement in the financials of the telecom business.

The current market price of Reliance Industries Ltd. is Rs 952.4.The time period given by analyst is year when Reliance Industries Ltd. price can reach defined target.  Reliance Industries Ltd., incorporated in the year 1973, is a large-cap company with a market cap of Rs 609852.63 crore. Investment rationale by HDFC Securities: RIL’s standalone numbers continued to impress, led by higher Petchem volumes and margins. Petchem production volumes were up 10% QoQ and 42% YoY to 8.8 mT owing to ROGC ramp up. EBIT/kg of sales volumes stood at Rs 17.87/kg (Rs 17/kg in 3Q, 13.2/kg in 4QFY17). EBIT margin was up 356bps YoY to 17.2%. Q4 EBITDA came in at Rs 134.25bn (+19% YoY). Higher interest cost, depreciation charges and taxes partially offset growth, and PAT stood at Rs 86.97bn (+6.7% YoY).Strong GRMs should continue, helped by a delay in the net addition to global refining capacity and strong demand growth with improving economic activity. RIL’s capex of USD 18.5bn in Refining and Chemicals is nearing completion. Some projects are already operational, and will boost EBITDA in the core business over FY17-20E. During the last five years, high capex in Telecom and Core business has dragged RIL's FCF. Rising dividend payouts are likely hereon.

2018-05-10,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Infratel on Thursday stressed on its desperate need to sell its towers and fibre to Reliance Jio to pare debt, saying it was in public interest. The company’s views, which were backed by lenders headed by State Bank of India, in an ongoing case between the tower arm of Reliance Communications and minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments, in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).During the day, HSBC Daisy Investments countered SBI’s stand, arguing that lenders had no locus in the matter.Justices SJ Mukhopadhaya and AIS Cheema also questioned the bank on its locus standi, and said that SBI should go for mortgaged assets to get its dues, and instead head to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code courts for their grievances as the present case was that of oppression of minority shareholders in the company.The case will be heard next on May 14, and then HSBC Daisy Investments and minority shareholders will argue their side on May 16 and 17.The bench was hearing Reliance Infratel’s appeal against a March 12 order of the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which barred it from selling its tower and fibre assets.The Anil Ambani-owned company has inked a deal with the telecom arm of elder brother Mukesh Ambani to buy its wireless assets including fibre, towers, spectrum and network nodes for about Rs 18,000 crore, which will be used to trim Reliance Communication’s debt of Rs 45,000 crore.While the Supreme Court allowed RCom to proceed with the sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes and real estate -- in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati -- a legal clearance on selling fibre and towers of the company is still hanging fire. The minority shareholders had alleged in the Supreme Court that they were being oppressed and alleged mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company.Out of 43,000 towers owned by Reliance Infratel, 32,000 towers are already leased out to Reliance Jio, the company had told NCLAT earlier this week.RCom is also battling Swedish equipment maker Ericsson, which filed a petition in the NCLT, seeking liquidation of the carrier to recover Rs 1,150 crore in owed dues. According to Ericsson, RCom had not paid it for equipment and services for two years, and instead issued only a few post-dated cheques.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/desperately-need-to-sell-towers-fibre-in-public-interest-reliance-infratel-tells-nclat/articleshow/64112266.cms

Tata Power Company Ltd., incorporated in the year 1919, is a Large Cap company (having a market cap of Rs 22125.05 Crore) operating in Power sector. Investment rationale by Reliance SecuritiesTata Power Company (TPCL) has posted consolidated (reported) Rs14.8bn net profit in 4QFY18 vs. Rs2.3bn net loss in 4QFY17 led by exceptional gains to the tune of Rs12.4bn. Its consolidated revenue rose by 14.2% YoY to Rs78.5bn vs. Rs68.8bn in 4QFY17. However, adjusted PBT declined by 31.5% YoY to Rs2.5bn from Rs3.6bn in 4QFY17 owing to lower dividend from associate companies, higher losses at Mundra Plant (CGPL) along with higher interest and depreciation cost. Looking ahead, we believe that any meaningful upside in valuation is capped owing to near-term overhang relating to losses at CGPL. Thus, we maintain our HOLD recommendation on the stock with an unrevised Target Price of Rs90.Outlook & Valuation: Looking ahead, we believe lower earnings from CGPL will continue to weigh on TPCL’s overall earnings.

Even adjusted for one-time slippages due to revised framework on stressed assets resolution by the RBI, its fresh slippages surged to Rs57.7bn vs. Rs43.8bn in 3QFY18.

Further, its core operating profit dipped by 18% YoY and 17.1% % QoQ to Rs41.9bn led by lower other income and muted growth in NII.

EBITDA stood at Rs4.1bn (+12% YoY and -7% QoQ) vs. our estimate of Rs4.3bn. Operating cost/tonne surged by 5% YoY and 2% QoQ to Rs3,783 mainly led by spike in input cost (due to higher fly-ash and gypsum prices), higher freight cost (led by increase in lead distance, FOR sales and diesel prices) and power & fuel cost (owing to higher petcoke prices). EBITDA/tonne stood at Rs655 vs. Rs606 and Rs750 in 1QCY17 and 4QCY17, respectively. EBITDA margin rose by 34bps YoY (-210bps QoQ) to 14.7%. Notably, average cement realisation came in marginally above our estimates at Rs4,438/tonne mainly aided by increasing contribution from premium products. Further, we believe that clarity on royalty payment to Holcim by maintaining 1% of net sales bodes well for the stock, as there were apprehensions among the investors about the possible increase in royalty charges.

2018-05-11,"MUMBAI: Union Bank of India and Vijaya Bank have classified loans to Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Naval and Engineering as non-performing as of March 31, a move triggered by the regulator’s decision in February to scrap all the restructuring schemes.This could force a bunch of banks to follow suit in the Rs 9,000 crore of loans extended to the ship builder, said bankers who did not want to be identified.“Many other banks will also classify this account as non-performing loan this quarter,” said a banker who did not want to be identified. “We are surprised why some private banks have taken a contrarian view,” said the state-run banker.CEOs of Union Bank of India and Vijaya Bank declined to comment citing client confidentiality.Some private banks have not classified the loan to Reliance Naval as bad loan, said independent research analyst Hemindra Harazi. Banks have lent more than Rs 9000 crore to RNE, which was earlier known as Reliance Defence and Engineering.Over the last several quarters the account was classified as SMA2 account in the books of most banks. SMA2 are special mention accounts where banks have not received dues for over 60 days but less than 90 days.“Union Bank and Vijaya Bank have taken the right and prudent decision to classify RNE as NPA. When RNE’s auditor has questioned the viability of the company as a going concern, other banks need to explain to their shareholders and respective regulators as to why they are classifying the account as standard asset,” said Hazari.Other banks such as State Bank of India and IDBI Bank with large exposures to Reliance Naval are yet to declare their fourth quarter results.Banks and Reliance Naval were working towards restructuring the loan but it did not work out since all banks did not agree on the terms, said the sources. If a resolution plan is not in place within 180 days from the day of default, banks will have to refer it to the bankruptcy court as per RBI norms.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/union-vijaya-banks-put-npa-tag-on-reliance-naval-loans/articleshow/64122106.cms
2018-05-12,"Financially strapped Reliance Group led by Anil Ambani has vacated its corporate headquarters, Reliance Centre, at Ballard Estate.The finance-to-defence conglomerate, which has been selling its assets to reduce debt, will now operate out of its corporate office at Santacruz.The group, with a total debt of around Rs 60,000 crore, sold its power distribution business in Mumbai to Adani Group for Rs 18,800 crore in March this year.The group’s flagship Reliance Communication has offered a 51% stake to its lenders. The company will repay the rest of its Rs 27,000 crore debt by raising Rs 17,000 crore through sale of spectrum it controls and mopping up another Rs 10,000 crore by selling off its real estate asset across the country.The group’s power generation arm, Reliance Power, is also struggling. Its market value currently stands at Rs 11,400 crore, Rs 300 crore less than the Rs 11,700 crore it raised through an IPO in 2008.A senior group executive, who did not wish to be identified, said: “For all practical purposes group’s corporate office has moved to Santacruz and the entire top management, including Anil Ambani, sits there. So, it did not make sense to maintain an office in south Mumbai.” For the past few years, the Ballard Estate Office was used only for important occasions such as board meetings and press conferences, he added.The group will continue to control around 6,000 sq ft spread across three floors at Reliance Centre. While officials refused to reveal what the group planned to do with this space, a real estate consultancy firm said it can earn Reliance up to Rs 10 lakh a month in rental.In the past decade or so, a number of corporates – including Hindustan Unilever, Merck, Siemens, and Johnson and Johnson – have moved out of south or central Mumbai to the suburbs.Built on Mumbai Port Trust land, the Reliance Centre (previously called Crescent House), was owned by ICI, a Kolkata-based company. The property came into Reliance’s possession when the then undivided Reliance Industries took over some ICI businesses in the early 1990s.Reliance Group was in a dispute with state government’s civil supplies department, which occupied some space on the third floor of the building. In January 1997 Reliance got the department to vacate the space so that repairs and renovations could be carried out. But when the rationing officers tried to reclaim their office space post-reconstruction in January 2002, they were denied entry which led to a protracted legal battle between the two. In September last year, the Supreme Court ruled in the favour of the state government.Emails and phone calls made to Reliance Infrastructure’s spokesman remained unanswered at the time of going to the press.

2018-05-14,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court today agreed to hear on May 18 the plea filed by telecom operator Reliance Jio (RJIO) against a Delhi High Court order asking Bharti Airtel to make changes to its advertisements offering ""live and free access"" to IPL coverage by carrying a disclaimer of a larger font size in a prominent and visible place. A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud directed listing of the matter on Friday before an appropriate bench. ""List on May 18, 2018 before an appropriate bench, as per roster,"" it said after the matter was mentioned before it by advocate K R Sasiprabhu. A division bench of the High Court on May 10 had modified its single judge's interim orders and questioned the maintainability of the suit filed by RJIO alleging that Airtel's advertisement was ""deceptive and misleading"". The single judge in his May 2 order had asked Airtel to use font of 12 pixels in print media and that too in a prominent and visible place and not at the bottom. The high court had however allowed the first interim order of April 13 to continue to operate. In the April 13 order, the single judge had asked Airtel to carry a disclaimer in bold stating that under its 'live and free access offer' only subscription to video streaming platform Hotstar would be free and data charges according to the subscriber's plan would apply. The May 2 order had said, ""So far as the video clips/television advertisements are concerned the disclaimer should start running from the word the girl says 'Seasonal Pass-------------' and it should be displayed in sync with the voice over. The disclaimer in bill boards and hoardings be also at prominent place."" During the hearing of the appeal by Airtel, the high court bench said it had ""grave doubts"" about maintainability of the suit by the RJIO. The RJIO, in its suit, had claimed that the advertisements ""falsely proclaim"" that Airtel was offering ""live and free"" access to T20 cricket coverage and also ""falsely represent that a subscriber need only obtain a 4G sim from the defendant company and download the Airtel TV app to obtain a virtual season pass, that is live and free access to T20 coverage"".",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ipl-coverage-sc-to-hear-reliance-jios-plea-against-delhi-hc-order/articleshow/64163495.cms

2018-05-16,"Global rating agency Fitch today affirmed Reliance Industries' long-term foreign-currency rating at BBB-, with a stable outlook.RIL's rating is supported by its strong business profile, which is driven by its robust refining and petrochemical operations, the agency said in a note.Its primary analyst and a director Muralidharan R cited the robust and improved refining operations that consistently outperform regional refining benchmarks as one of the reasons for retaining the rating with stable outlook.The company runs the world's largest single-location refinery at Jamnagar with a daily capacity of around 1.24 million barrels.Reliance Industries (RIL) also benefits from its dominant market position in the petrochemical business, driven by its integrated business model with minimal presence in upstream. RIL recently completed a massive capex that upped the downstream integration, improving its business profile.RIL's GRM (gross refining margin) improved to USD 11.6 a barrel in FY18, from USD 11 a barrel in FY17, in line with strong industry-wide margins, Muralidharan said in the note.""While we expect industry-wide refining margins to moderate, we expect RIL's GRMs to remain strong, supported by benefits of its capex. It completed the first phase of a gasification project in H2 of FY18, with the balance scheduled for completion in the H1 of FY19,"" he said.But the rating agency noted that its digital services business, Jio, is still small and evolving, and faces intense competition from incumbents. RIL has pumped in around Rs 2.2 trillion till March 2018 into Jio, and ""we expect it to make further investments based on the actual growth and performance,"" it added.Since Jio has turned profitable in the first year of operations to the year to march 2018, ""we expect it to continue to register strong growth and its business to evolve over the medium-term.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fitch-affirms-ril-ratings-with-stable-outlook/articleshow/64189559.cms

2018-05-17,"MUMBAI: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power has exited the ultra-mega power project (UMPP) that it had bagged in Tilaiya by selling it to the state-run Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam for Rs 113 crore, after the project didn’t take off and the company terminated power purchase agreements with different states.Sources told ET that the company is now planning a similar exit from its other UMPP which was to be set up at Krishnapatnam.“The company has transferred its entire holding of 1,49,900 equity shares of Rs 10 each, aggregating Rs 14,99,000 held in Jharkhand Integrated Power Limited, a special purpose vehicle created for development of Tilaiya UMPP, to Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam, the lead procurer, acting on behalf of procurers of Tilaiya UMPP,” the company informed the bourses.Reliance Power bagged the Tilaiya project, which was to run on captive mines in 2009 and had plans to commission it by 2015. The company managed to bag it amid competition with an aggressive bid of Rs 1.77 a unit and had signed power purchase agreements with 18 procurers in 10 states. But after years of delay, which the company blamed on the state government’s inability to hand over the land and inordinate delays in getting approvals, the company decided to drop the project.“Reliance Power gets Rs 113 crore, and the bank guarantees worth Rs 600 crore that were with procurers have also been released. Tilaiya UMPP is a closed chapter for the company,” a source close to the development told ET.In April 2015, Reliance Power initiated the process to exit the project and terminated agreements with the discoms, and that is when the lead procurer state Jharkhand decided to step in and acquire the project.Reliance Power was the only power utility to bag three of the government’s ambitious UMPPs—in Sasan, Krishnapatnam and Tilaiya. While all three projects were marred with challenges and delays, the company managed to complete the Sasan project.The company is believed to have approached the Andhra Pradesh government for a similar exit from the Krishnapatnam UMPP, which it had bagged in 2007. This project was to be fuelled by imported coal and with increase in coal prices, the company has said that the tariff of Rs 2.33 was unviable.Under the UMPP policy, the government identifies a project and sets up a shell company that secures land and other clearances. The shell company is then transferred to the developer who is willing to develop the project for the lowest tariff.Fuel accounts for almost 70% of the generation cost for a company. Typically, developers quote lower charges for escalation in fuel prices to make their bids more competitive and so the onus of the risk related to the fuel charges is on them.Reliance Power and Tata Power had bagged Krishnapatnam and Mundra UMPPs with bids based on imported coal from Indonesia, factoring in low to almost no escalation in prices, but the country changed its pricing policy which hurt the viability of these projects. While Tatas had already built the project, Reliance Power pulled the plug on the Krishnapatnam project during early stages.In a separate development relating to its Sasan ultra-mega power project, the company has filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the levy of tax on value of mineral-bearing land for captive coal mines allocated to the unit by the government of Madhya Pradesh, Reliance Power informed the bourses on Thursday.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-power-divests-holding-in-spv-for-tilaiya-umpp-to-juvnl-for-rs-113-crore/articleshow/64203977.cms
2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI: Several expats holding senior positions at the Mukesh Ambani-led 4G telco, Reliance Jio, have quit the company in a quick succession. Tareq Amin, Senior Vice President of Technology Development, Ayush Sharma, Senior Vice President of engineering and technology and Nikola Sucevic, Assistant Vice President and data science head have recently quit the company, people familiar with the development said.Jio’s senior vice president, Aayush Bhatnagar, is now leading Amin and Sharma’s technology-related projects for the company, another person said.A query sent to Jio didn’t elicit any response.The exits take place as Jio seeks to expand beyond mobile phone services to tap areas such as the Internet of Things, for which it has launched a pan-India network in partnership with Samsung. The telco is also offering fiber-to-home (FTTH) broadband pilot services and it will soon launch it commercially.Amin, who joined Jio in 2013, had been a prominent global face for Jio, having represented the telecom operator at various international platforms, including the Small Cell Forum.At Jio, Amin was responsible for overseeing all aspects of the technology development and automation organization, including innovation, development, and operation. He served companies like Huawei and T-Mobile in the US before joining Jio in Mumbai, India.Sharma, on the other hand, was brought on board from Silicon Valley as senior vice president of engineering and technology in January this year to drive the business around IoT and other technologies such as mobile edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence and blockchain.Sharma had joined the company after working on his own venture, MotoJeannie, in the United States, and worked for telecom gear makers Huawei and Ericsson, and Cisco in the past in the US.

2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Reliance Communications and Ericsson are in advanced talks to settle their dispute over the telco’s dues outside the insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings, said people aware of the matter, a move that drove the carrier’s shares as much as 70% higher on Thursday.“Right now, talks are on but no formal proposal has been made,” one of the people said. Another person said, “The amount to be paid is being discussed for settlement.”Swedish equipment maker Ericsson has sought an undertaking that State Bank of India, one of RCom’s lenders, will pay up the dues if the Anil Ambani-controlled telco does not clear the settled amount, one person said.A third person said that the latest settlement amount being discussed is around Rs 700 to Rs 800 crore, after Ericsson rejected an initial offer of Rs 400-500 crore. “SBI is likely to come up with a bank guarantee of the settlement amount”.Ericsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom’s nationwide telecom network, is trying to recover over Rs 1,000 crore in dues.The talks to settle the dues came two days after the National Company Law Tribunal admitted three petitions filed by Ericsson against the telco and its subsidiaries and ordered bankruptcy proceedings against RCom. If a pact is reached, the two parties would need to approach a higher court to get the NCLT order repealed.A settlement outside the insolvency process, if allowed, may help RCom to move ahead with a plan to sell its wireless assets – spectrum, towers, fibre network and switching nodes – to Reliance Jio Infocomm for Rs 18,000 crore and pare debt of Rs 46,000 crore.The RCom stock surged as much as 70% to Rs 17.90 on the BSE on Thursday, before closing at Rs 16.55 with a 57% gain. The share price had fallen as much as 20% on Wednesday, a day after the NCLT admitted the insolvency petitions against RCom.A third person said any settlement between RCom and Ericsson could strengthen the case by HSBC Daisy Investments and other minority shareholders against RCom’s tower unit, Reliance Infratel, in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. HSBC and the others oppose the sale of Reliance Infratel’s tower and fibre assets to Jio to protect their interests.RCom declined to comment on the possible settlement of the dues. Ericsson said it doesn’t respond to market speculation. SBI did not reply to ET’s queries.Earlier Thursday though, the NCLT had rejected RCom’s plea to put off delivering the full order citing its talks with. The full order was made public later in the day, triggering insolvency proceedings against what was once India’s second largest carrier.According to the NCLT order, insolvency proceedings against RCom were to have started from May 15. The interim resolution professional, who is yet to be appointed, would have 270 days to come up with a solution to bring RCom back, failing which the company could face liquidation. RCom became only the second telco, after Aircel, to be admitted to bankruptcy proceedings.Ericsson has suggested two to three names as the interim resolution professional and is awaiting approval from the NCLT, one of the people said.The tribunal, in its order which was seen by ET, admitted Ericsson’s petitions on the grounds that the aspects of debt and default from RCom’s side were proven by the Swedish company. When the gear maker filed the petitions in April 2017, RCom owed it Rs 978.72 crore and the carrier continued to default on payments without disputing the amount or the services provided. The order states the dues to be about Rs 1,012 crore.“The petitioner (Ericsson) proved existence of debt and default… we are of the considered view that these petitions are fit for admission,” the two-member panel headed by BSV Prakash Kumar said. The bench ordered that a public announcement of the insolvency resolution process be made.“It appears that Reliance (RCom) failed to adhere to the terms and conditions entered in between Ericsson and Reliance by failing to make payment amounting to approx. Rs 1,000 crore,” it said, adding that the company would not be able to sell or transfer its assets to anyone.It added that all other legal proceedings against RCom would not move further and this includes Ericsson’s case against RCom in a separate arbitral tribunal.The order jeopardised RCom’s plan to use funds from the deal with Jio to repay a group of 28 lenders led by SBI. RCom shut its wireless operations in late 2017 after a merger attempt with Aircel fell through. It was unable to sustain operations in an intensely competitive market after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-communications-ericsson-in-talks-to-settle-dues-outside-nclt/articleshow/64212016.cms

2018-05-20,"Reliance Industries (RIL) has received environment clearance for the expansion and optimisation of its petrochemical complex at Nagothane in Raigad district of Maharashtra at an estimated cost of Rs 2,338 crore.""The environment clearance has been given to the RIL's expansion and debottlenecking of petrochemical project at Nagothane,"" a senior Environment Ministry official said.The approval, given based on the recommendations of an expert panel, is subject to compliance of certain conditions, the official said.The proposal is to expand the gas cracker and downstream plants located at Nagothane village in Raigad district by way of debottlenecking, expansion and change of fuel in captive power plant (CPP) along with expansion and rebuilding of residential township.The cost of the proposed project, expected to be commissioned in stages, is estimated to be Rs 2,338 crore, the official added.As per the proposal, no additional land and manpower is required for the proposed project. It has 744 hectare land and 1,794 manpower at present.The company manufactures wide range of products such as Ethylene Oxide, Ethylene Glycol, Linear Low Density High Density Polyethylene (LLHDPE), Hexene-1 and others along with a gas-based CPP.Presently, RIL Nagothane uses a mixture of ethane and propane to produce downstream products and by-products. The proposal is to modify its feedstock ratio in its gas cracker plant owing to availability of imported shale gas ethane.With the proposed change in feedstock mixture resulting in higher production of ethylene, the company wants to expand the capacities of downstream products/by-products to accommodate the increased ethyelene production.That apart, the company has proposed to enhance CPP capacity from 85 mw to 100 mw by way of refurbishing and also use ethane as a fuel owing to its economic viability and availability.Further, the proposed project also includes expansion of the existing township with additional residential apartments within the township area.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/ril-gets-green-nod-for-rs-2338-cr-expansion-project-in-maharashtra/articleshow/64243145.cms

2018-05-24,"NEW DELHI: India’s oil ministry has ordered Reliance Industries, Royal Dutch Shell and Oil & Natural Gas Corp to pay $3.8 billion as the increased share of the government’s earnings from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields after a UK court rejected challenges to the arbitration award that went against the companies, people familiar with the matter said.The liability is to be shared by the companies in proportion to their interests in the oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea – ONGC (40%), RIL (30%) and Shell (30%). The demand was made a few days ago.Reliance and Shell separately said a demand for payment at this stage was premature because the arbitral tribunal is yet to determine the final outcome of the proceedings. Reliance and BG (taken over by Shell) had invoked arbitration against the government in December 2010 after a dispute over the state’s share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast. The government said profit should be calculated after adding the marketing margins of the companies and that only the actual taxes paid could be counted as costs, not the notional rate mentioned in the contractThe government barred stateowned ONGC from the arbitration, although the outcome of the proceedings would apply to the exploration company as well.The arbitration tribunal had pronounced a ‘final partial award’ in October 2016, which went largely in favour of the government.The ministry of petroleum & natural gas then computed the liability of the three companies and directed them in May last year to pay the differential share of profit and royalty of $3.9 billion. The companies refused to pay, saying the award had been challenged in a UK court and the liability not yet been quantified by the tribunal.Reliance and Shell registered nine challenges to the award in court, which rejected all but one in its judgement last month. The government recomputed the liability and, citing the court’s verdict, sent a fresh demand notice of $3.8 billion this month, warning that interest will pile up if they don’t pay in time, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.“The English court delivered its judgment on April 16, 2018 and by its order dated May 2, 2018 decided to remit one of the challenged issues back to the arbitration tribunal for reconsideration.The arbitration tribunal has scheduled a hearing on the remitted issue and shall, thereafter, deliver the award,” a spokesperson for Reliance said in response to ET’s query. “The tribunal has to first decide the remitted issue and thereafter consider claimants’ applications for increase in cost recovery limit under the production sharing contracts. After these two issues are decided, the tribunal shall be scheduling the quantification phase of the arbitration to ascertain monetary liabilities, if any, of the parties.”“The arbitral process is still ongoing and is subject to confidentiality restrictions and any view on the outcome of this process including any potential payments by either of the parties are premature at this stage since further proceedings, including quantification, are yet to be concluded,” a spokesperson for Shell companies in India said.The oil ministry didn’t respond to ET’s query. ONGC said it is not party to the arbitration and the proceedings in the UK court and has no information on them or any awards or orders passed.The UK court upheld the tribunal’s view that profit from the fields should be calculated after deducting tax at 33%, not the notional 50% rate. It also agreed with the tribunal in saying that companies must include marketing margins in the sales price for computing the profit share and royalty due to the government. Other challenges that the court dismissed included those related to the limit on cost recovery and the withholding of payments by GAIL India and Indian Oil Corp for output from the fields.The challenge of the companies that succeeded related to their contention that the government had agreed to certain development costs that could be recovered fully, without restriction.

2018-05-24,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio’s feature phone — JioPhone — has achieved a feat that none of the Indian brands has ever been able to do: take the No. 1spot in the feature phone market globally.The 4G feature phone from the retail arm of Reliance Industries (RIL), cornered a 15% share of the global market, with Finland’s Nokia having 14% share, African major Itel at No.3 with 13% and South Korean smartphone giant Samsung and Itel’s sister brand Tecno sharing No.4 position with 6% each in the quarter ended March 2018.According to Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, the company’s phone, which it sold effectively free of cost, also pushed the global feature phone market up by 38% on-year. India alone contributed to almost 43% of the total feature phone shipments in the quarter.“Reliance Jio 4G feature phone quickly made it to the top spot in the global feature phone market, underlining the potential of 4G featurephones,” said research analyst Shobhit Srivastava, in a blog post on Thursday.“Companies like KaiOS and Reliance Jio are working to add more value to the 4G feature phones, as a result making it more appealing for bottom-of-pyramid users who are not comfortable with touch form factor, lack of vernacular content and quality smartphones below $40,” he added.JioPhone has also made it to the top spot in the Indian feature phone market.

Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Cipla price can reach the defined target.  Cipla Ltd., incorporated in 1935, is a large-cap pharma company with a market cap of Rs 43142.31 crore.Investment rationale by Reliance SecuritiesLooking ahead, we envisage Cipla’s US business to witness a strong growth on the back of ramp-up in existing products, low base, new launches and aggressive filings (filed 24 ANDAs in FY18 & 32 in FY17; plans to file 20+ ANDAs in FY19; 104 ANDAs pending for approval), while India business is expected to witness a healthy growth. However, factoring in weak 4QFY18 along with adverse product-mix and slower-than-expected growth in operating profit, we cut our EPS estimates by 14.3% and 14.0% for FY19E and FY20E, respectively. At CMP, stock trades at PE multiples of 22.0x and 18.4x of FY19E and FY20E EPS, respectively, which appear to be expensive.

The Ramco Cements Ltd., incorporated in 1957, is a large-cap cement company with a market cap of Rs 18841.78 crore. Investment rational by Reliance SecuritiesRamco Cements (RCL) has delivered an improved performance in 4QFY18, with its operating profit growing by 12% YoY and 18% QoQ to Rs2.68bn (vs. our estimate of Rs2.25bn) led by higher-than-estimated sales volume. EBITDA/tonne came in at Rs980 vs. Rs1,052 and Rs996 in 4QFY17 and 3QFY18, respectively, while average realisation/ tonne stood at Rs4,571 (+2.7% YoY and -0.8% QoQ). Sales volume improved substantially by 20% YoY and 21% QoQ to 2.74mnT mainly on account of higher contribution from the Eastern markets and gradual revival in Tamil Nadu. Considering visible revival in TN markets and sustained demand environment in other key markets, we believe RCL may continue to deliver higher sales in subsequent years. However, we cut EBITDA estimates by 3.5% and 4% for FY19E and FY20E, respectively mainly to factor in higher fuel prices.

2018-05-29,"Reliance Communications' tower arm has reached a settlement with minority investors including HSBC Daisy Investments, a big step towards clearing the way for the sale of the telco's towers and fibre assets to Reliance Jio. The move pushed up RCom's scrip 6.21% on the Bombay Stock Exchange to Rs 16.25 on Tuesday. According to sources, the Anil Ambani owned company has agreed to pay Rs 232 crore to the minority investors for settling the issue. Separately, RCom has offered an upfront payment of Rs 500 crore to its operational creditor Ericsson, which has got an insolvency order against the Anil Ambani group firm. Ericsson had total dues of Rs 978, which have now increased to Rs 1,600 crore, counsel appearing for Ericsson informed.""Reliance Infratel Ltd., a subsidiary of RCOM has informed the Hon''ble NCLAT today that an amicable settlement has been arrived at between it and minority investors holding 4.26% equity in the Company, and consent terms will be filed shortly,"" RCom said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The settlement with the minority investors paves the way for vacation of the stay granted by the NCLT on the sale of Reliance Infratel's tower and fibre assets, and will enable the company to proceed with asset monetisation of Rs 8,000 crore as soon as the company exits the debt resolution process under NCLT, Rcom added.This would put to end a long drawn legal battle between the minority shareholders and the Anil Ambani-owned company, which has inked a deal with the telecom arm of elder brother Mukesh Ambani to buy its wireless assets including fibre, towers, spectrum and network nodes for about Rs 18,000 crore. The proceeds will be used to trim Reliance Communication’s debt of Rs 45,000 crore.The minority shareholders had alleged in the Supreme Court that they were being oppressed and alleged mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company. They had nvested Rs 1,100 crore in July 2007 and had also filed a contempt petition against the tower arm of RCom for not providing details of its expected asset sale to Jio. The original petition was filed in 2014, when Rcom proposed Infratel’s merger with another group company on grounds of depressed valuation. The minority shareholders thwarted other attempts to sell tower arm to Tillman Global Holdings and TPG in 2015 and later to alternative asset management company Brookfield in 2016.The appeal for exiting the insolvency process, supported by all lenders, is fixed for hearing later today before the NCLAT, RCom added in its statement.However, the matter may come up for hearing tomorrow, along with that of Ericsson which was slotted for today as well.RCom is also trying to reach an out of court settlement with operational creditor Ericsson, following which it and its subsidiary companies can move out of insolvency. The Swedish gear maker had sought Rs 1150 crore from RCom as dues that the company owes to the network provider. The matter between Ericsson and RCom also came up in NCLAT today, during which Kapil Sibal represebting RCom told the bench that negotiations were on for Rs 500 crore, to which Ericsson said they would need Rcom and units to pay at least Rs 980 crore, which is the admitted amount. Rajiv Mehra represented Standard Chartered Bank, Tushar Mehta came from SBI, while Ericsson was represented by Salman Khurshid, Anil Kher , Arun Katpalia.The NCLAT bench has asked both parties to settle and get back tomorrow. Ericsson and RCom will enter round of meetings today, another source said.

2018-05-29,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Reliance Communications took big strides towards repaying its lenders by reaching a Rs 232-crore settlement with minority investors of its tower unit and moving closer to resolving a dispute over dues with Sweden’s Ericsson.A truce between Ericsson and the telco appeared imminent, with both sides veering towards Rs 600-700 crore as settlement amount that would end their eight-month battle, according to people aware of the negotiations.Settlements between Reliance Infratel and its minority shareholders and between RCom and Ericsson would end the legal battles that have impeded the Anil Ambani-controlled company’s efforts to trim debt through the sale of assets.Following the settlement reached with HSBC Daisy Investments and other minority investors, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday allowed RCom’s tower unit Reliance Infratel, backed by lender State Bank of India, to withdraw its petition challenging a Mumbai bankruptcy court’s stay on the sale of its tower and fibre network, valued at some Rs 8,000 crore.“In view of consent terms, parties are allowed to withdraw their appeal,” the bench headed by chairman justice SJ Mukhopadhaya said.The developments pushed up RCom shares by almost 10%, before closing 4.3% higher at Rs 15.95 on the BSE.RCom is trying to sell its spectrum, fibre network, towers and switching nodes to Reliance Jio Infocomm for Rs 17,000-18,000 crore to pare Rs 46,000 crore of debt, which was stalled by the legal challenges.The minority shareholders, including HSBC Daisy, had alleged they were being oppressed and that their consent for the sale of assets was not taken, as per the articles of association of the company. Claiming to have invested Rs 1,100 crore in July 2007, they had also filed a contempt petition against the tower arm of RCom for not providing details of its expected asset sale to Jio.The minority shareholders of Reliance Infratel will get the settlement amount once RCom resolves its dispute with Ericsson and is out of the debt resolution proceedings ordered in mid-May by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), a person familiar with the matter said.The NCLT, acting on a petition by Ericsson, appointed interim resolution professionals for RCom, Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom, another subsidiary.

2018-05-31,"MUMBAI: The Delhi high court has accepted a defamation suit filed by Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) against industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and its director general, Rajan Mathews, seeking damages for allegedly using disparaging remarks which were malicious and harmed the Mukesh Ambani-owned carrier’s reputation.The Delhi High Court, in its interim order dated May 30, said that there was prima facie a case and directed Mathews and COAI, which represents all major telcos operating in India, to refrain from using “disparaging and defamatory” words or phrases like ""back door operator"", ""skullduggery"", ""deep pockets with monopolistic designs"" against Jio.In its petition, Jio had sought that COAI and Mathews be restrained from making such remarks.“...the Plaintiff seeks an order awarding general and special damages in favour of the Plaintiff, inter alia, for loss of reputation and the enormous business losses suffered by the Plaintiff on account of illegal actions and the malicious campaign of the defendants...,” Jio said. It further alleged that the industry body and its director general had tried to thwart its entry into the telecom market and later stifle growth and advance the interests of the other members of COAI. It did not name the other members which include India’s top three telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, besides Jio itself.While COAI and Mathews' counsel defended these allegations, saying they were “fair comments” and not under the purview of defamation, the bench headed by Justice Yogesh Khanna disagreed. ""I doubt whether the phrases/ words used back door operator"" ""skullduggery"", ""deep pockets with monopolistic designs"" would fall within the phrase of fair comment and hence the plaintiff has been able to make out a prima facie case...."", said the order, a copy of which is with ET.The bench has asked the defendants to file their responses within four weeks post which rejoinders can be filed, three weeks from then on. The next hearing has been scheduled for August 24.Speaking to ET, Mathews again denied making any defamatory statements.“Disappointed that one of our member companies has chosen to bring legal action against the association and its director general, alleging defamation, rising from use of language in communication"" said Mathews. He added that the industry body and he would ""vigorously defend its case"" which was ""without merit"".Jio and COAI have for long been at loggerheads, with the new entrant having previously accused COAI and Mathews of toeing the line of India’s three older operators at the cost of the newcomer, without taking into account its views. COAI and Mathews have maintained that they speak for the industry and always put in a disclaimer that Jio or one operator does not agree with its views.The latest issue arose when in February, the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco issued a defamation notice to COAI and Mathews for saying that the telecom regulator favoured Jio through its regulations at the cost of India's older operators such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.The industry body had then denied these charges, saying its differences were with the sector regulator's recent orders and there was no intention to aggrieve any particular operator. The group said it had raised concerns keeping growth and development of industry in mind.Jio with 180 million plus subscribers had then refused to buy the industry body’s reasons. It criticised COAI’s for not apologising and reiterated that it had the option of battling out the matter in courts.Earlier, the telecom regulator too had dismissed as “baseless” allegations by India’s top three operators that its recent rulings and policies are biased against them and said the companies are free to move court if they find any anomaly in its orders.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/court-refrains-coai-from-making-disparaging-remarks-against-reliance-jio/articleshow/64404325.cms
2018-06-01,"Reliance Pharma Fund has surprised investors with 16 per cent returns in the last year. The double-digit return is even more impressive because the pharma fund category has managed only 0.43 per cent returns during the same period. Most stock market pundits are still pessimistic about the sector. ET.com Mutual Fund's Shivani Bazaz spoke to Sailesh Raj Bhan, who manages Reliance Pharma Fund, to find out his secret recipe.Reliance Pharma Fund has topped the pharma category with around 16 per cent returns last year. How did you achieve this? Since its inception (June 5, 2004) Reliance Pharma Fund's NAV has grown 13.6x (times) or in other words the fund has delivered 20.51 per cent compounded annualized returns in nearly 14 years (data as on May 30, 2018). During this period the focus has always been on buying good quality businesses at reasonable prices and staying invested through the years to get compounding benefits. Despite the last three years of the sector being tepid, the focus on quality companies and discipline on valuations has enabled the fund to achieve its objective. The cautious stand on US businesses for the last two to three years and the focus on domestic businesses has supported the fund performance in the recent past. The performance is even more astounding because most of the schemes are giving single digit returns. Given the focus on “sustainable profitable growth at reasonable prices” as a investment style, Reliance Pharma Fund was disciplined to avoid sub-scale and inferior businesses in its journey. This immensely benefited the fund as inferior companies completely got decimated in the last two years of weak pharma sector cycle.The scheme is betting on stocks focusing on domestic consumption. Has this approach helped the scheme? India has high incidence of chronic diseases – diabetes, cardiac, thyroid, etc which needs pharmaceutical intervention to maintain quality of life. Rising diagnostics and testing facilities, rising incomes and focus on health is driving demand. Reliance Pharma Fund invests in leaders in these categories which serve long term patient needs. Most of these businesses have consumer characteristics like high free cash flows due to low capex and are primarily marketing brands to consumers. Interestingly in the stock markets, these businesses trade at 30-40 per cent discount to pure FMCG companies, despite having the same opportunity of scale and penetration. Hence pharmaceutical companies with domestic opportunity provide sustainable long term growth and have tremendous potential.Around 50 per cent of the assets in the scheme are concentrated in the top five stocks. Has this concentrated approach worked well for the scheme? Interestingly, pharma sector provides for some level of diversification unlike other sectors as it has many sub-segments with different drivers – for example, domestic branded companies, US generic businesses, emerging market branded businesses, contract research companies, hospital and healthcare services. Reliance Pharma Fund’s exposures are generally in companies with long operating history and with leadership characteristics and are spread across the above mentioned five sub categories in the pharmaceutical space.What is your outlook for the pharma sector in the next three to four quarters? Pharma sector is going through a bad phase. The valuations are attractive in the sector but are there enough opportunities for growth? Pharma sector in India is in its early stages of growth with many opportunities to gain from. Indian domestic market is significantly under diagnosed, under penetrated and has years of growth ahead, given the high level of incidence of chronic diseases in India. Health insurance penetration and associated healthcare infrastructure like hospitals are still in early stages of growth and will create a large opportunity. In international markets, Indian companies have demonstrated strong successes and as environment improves will be major beneficiaries given their skill and cost advantages.  In the near term, earnings for domestic businesses should continue to trend strongly, while recovery in US business from the low base should get visible to investors. Given the last 2-3 difficult years for the sector, the opportunity is attractive as growth returns and investors start focusing beyond the US generic challenges.Do you think it is a good time to start investing in pharma sector funds? What should retail investors expect from the pharma funds? Should the return expectations be modest? The earnings in the pharmaceutical sector are likely to improve, given the low base of last three years, resolution of FDA related challenges (with time already elapsed) and strong growth in domestic market. The recent depreciation of the currency will also support earnings of exporting companies.

2018-06-03,"MUMBAI: A group representing the country’s major telecom operators is evaluating legal options to counter a defamation suit filed by Reliance Jio Infocomm, one of its members, against it and its director general.The Delhi High Court accepted the defamation suit against the Cellular Operators Association of India last week. In an interim order, the court asked the association and director general Rajan Mathews to refrain from using “disparaging and defamatory” words or phrases against Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio, which the telco alleged, had hurt its reputation.Jio’s allegations were “patently misconceived” as all communications were “issued in good faith” and were made to call attention to “regulatory decisions that are detrimental to the growth and development of the telecom sector and to seek intervention of the regulator,” COAI said in a statement on Sunday.“COAI is well within its rights to hold and voice its views on regulatory and policy issues. The matter is currently sub judice and we are in the process of considering and evaluating our legal options,” Mathews said.He added that it was disappointing to see a member take legal steps against the association. “We believe the allegations are without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously,” said Mathews.Jio had alleged that the industry body and its DG had tried to thwart its entry into the telecom market and later stifle its growth while advancing the interests of other members, including India’s top three telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which together account for more than 60% of the nation’s mobile phone subscribers.Jio, which has signed up more than 186 million subscribers (15.7% market share) since starting operations in September 2016, had alleged that COAI’s previous statements had reflected its biases against the telco.The industry body has alleged that some of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s decisions, including local interconnection rate cuts, were detrimental to the industry and favoured Jio.The association defended its comments, saying that a “clear, stable and predictable policy environment is the foremost requirement of any regulatory regime that fosters industry growth and customer services.”The industry body hoped that the legal authorities would take “a more balanced view on this issue, which may be impacting the relationship of the member and the association and also the entire industry.”Earlier, the regulator and Jio had dismissed as “baseless” allegations by India’s top three operators that Trai’s recent rulings and policies were biased against them. Trai had said the companies were free to move court if they found any anomaly in its orders.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/coai-mulls-legal-options-on-reliance-jio-defamation-suit/articleshow/64437567.cms

2018-06-05,"New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm had no option but to file a defamation suit against the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) because the group disregarded its suggestions and adopted a partisan approach that favoured three older operators, a senior official at the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco said.COAI had also levelled “baseless” allegations against the operator and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), besides criticising decisions made by the regulator in the interest of consumers, the official said.Jio, which started services in September 2016 with a nationwide 4G network, claims that the industry body and its director general had tried to prevent its entry into the telecom market and later restrain its growth while favouring Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, the top three telcos.“COAI has been taking a partisan approach and all the time they’ve tried to protect incumbent operators, while making baseless allegations against Jio and the regulator,” the official told ET, asking not to be identified.Even when points of interconnection between networks were being illegally denied to Jio, COAI still favoured its rival operators, the official said. The other operators have said previously that adequate points of interconnection were provided to Jio. “All the decisions that have been taken by Trai, which are in consumer interest, have also been criticised by COAI just to protect the interests of incumbent operators. Jio tried to reason out with COAI a number of times, but they started issuing defamatory and derogatory statements. Left with no alternative, Jio had to take the legal recourse,” he added.The comments came a day after the lobby group representing all the country’s major telecom operators, including Jio, said that it is evaluating legal options to counter the defamation suit filed against COAI and its director general.The suit filed in the Delhi High Court last week sought that the association and its director general Rajan Mathews be told to refrain from using “disparaging and defamatory” words or phrases against Jio since the comments, made on several occasions, had hurt its reputation.Jio, which has signed up more than 186 million subscribers (15.7% market share) since starting operations, had alleged that COAI’s previous statements had reflected its biases against the telco. Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular together account for more than 60% of the nation’s mobile phone subscribers. COAI has previously said that some of Trai’s decisions, including local interconnection rate cuts — from 14 paise to 6 paise a minute — were detrimental to the industry and favoured Jio, allegations that the regulator and Jio have rubbished.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-says-had-no-option-but-to-file-defamation-suit-against-coai/articleshow/64458569.cms

The hospital is built on a 17-acre plot owned by the BMC under apublic-private partnership.The hospital, located close to the international airport, slipped into the red in 2013-14 and 2015-16, consistently losing nearly Rs 150 crore every year after that.In the past one year, over 50 of its consultants have not received their salaries and its outpatients department (OPD) has been shut.

2018-06-07,"RIL's telecom arm Reliance Jio today said it is looking at covering 99 per cent of India's population by the end of the current fiscal.  ""India's digital services market is continuing its exponential growth trajectory with Jio expanding its coverage and further deepening in existing areas to achieve 99 per cent population coverage during FY 2018-19,"" Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), parent firm of Jio, said in its annual report today.  The company reported to have 186.6 million subscribers as on March 31, 2018, up by around 83 million compared to 2016-17, with average revenue per user of Rs 137 per month.  ""Our new-age consumer businesses achieved leadership positions nationally - their growth rates outpacing the best in the world. Jio, now the world's largest and fastest growing mobile data network, stunned the world and made us proud by turning profitable in the very first year of operations,"" RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said.  He added that from a mere 2 per cent in FY 2016-17, Jio and Retail accounted for 13.1 per cent of RIL's consolidated segment EBITDA in FY 2017-18.  ""This was achieved notwithstanding a sharp 33.6 per cent spurt in consolidated EBITDA to Rs 74,184 crore,"" Ambani said.  The report said that in the very first year of commercial operations, digital services business recorded revenue of Rs 23,916 crore.  Reliance's gross debt was at Rs 2,18,763 crore during 2017-18 which includes standalone gross debt of Rs 58,392 crore of Reliance Jio, according to the report.  ""During FY 2017-18, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) successfully refinanced long-term syndicated loans aggregating USD 1.5 billion, resulting in substantial interest,"" the report said.  The report said that Reliance Jio has built India's largest next generation all-IP data network with latest 4G LTE technology which is ready to deploy 5G technology and beyond.  RJIL's total spectrum footprint at the end of 2017-18 stood at at 1,108 MHz (uplink + downlink) across three spectrum bands namely 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2300 MHz band across all the 22 circles with an average life of over 15 years.

2018-06-08,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio Infocomm reiterated its backing for the regulator’s decision to slash the interconnection usage charge (IUC), saying it removes an “artificial tariff hurdle” and will lead to quicker adoption of advanced technologies like Voice over LTE (VoLTE).The IUC cut “…not only removes the artificial tariff hurdle with floor price but also allows faster adoption of more efficient technologies like VoLTE, as erstwhile legacy networks are nearing obsolescence,” the Mukesh Ambani-owned telecom company in its annual report.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India slashed IUC — a charge paid to the telco on whose network a call terminates — by about 57% to 6 paise a minute starting from October 2017 and decided to scrap the charge from January 1, 2020.The decision was opposed by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, India’s biggest operators. They have over 60% of the country’s mobile subscribers and benefit from a higher IUC because more calls and messages terminate on their networks. The three companies alleged the regulator favoured Jio and have moved court, challenging the decision to lower IUC.Jio, which started services in September 2016 with an all-India 4G network, offers free calls and data at low rates. It is a net payer of the charge and had pushed for complete removal of IUC on voice calls.Taking further pot shots at its competitors, Jio said digitisation and data consumption before its entry were “subdued, because of inadequate investment in infrastructure, lack of credible competitive environment coupled with steep pricing.”Jio has attracted heavy data traffic since it started services. Its wireless data traffic was 5.06 billion GB in the January-March quarter, up 14% from the previous quarter. Comparatively, Bharti Airtel recorded about 1.5 billion GB. Average monthly data consumption per user was 9.7 GB for Jio, while average monthly voice traffic was 716 minutes per user. Airtel, in comparison, recorded 670 minutes per user, while data usage per subscriber was 6.6 GB. The telco said in its report that although the industry’s contribution to GDP was 6.5%, it hitherto had a “monolithic approach towards consumer with limited innovation or collaboration that drives eco-system benefits to the end consumer.”The operator has 68 patent filings and said it is ready for 5G technology, which would require minimal capital expenditure on its network.Jio highlighted the rural markets as an opportunity, with most internet access skewed largely in favour of urban India. Of 906 million people living in rural India, about 750 million do not have access to internet, the company said.“The above gap represents an opportunity of at least 150 million households, which are yet to be connected,” it said.Jio added that its “smart feature phones,” marketed by Reliance Retail, will bridge the digital gap by “reaching out to the bottom of the pyramid with several data-driven functionalities bundled into the devices.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-again-backs-trai-move-to-slash-iuc/articleshow/64501918.cms
2018-06-08,"Reliance Industries (RIL) has sought shareholder approval to raise up to Rs 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in 2018-19, according to its annual report for FY18.RIL said that its oil and gas business continued to face headwinds due to declining volumes, especially as it “shutin” three operational wells at its Krishna-Godavari D6 basin. While it cautioned on its shale gas business, RIL said it is poised to become one of the largest non-conventional gas producers in India with the ramp up of its coal bed methane (CBM) production that crossed 1 mscmd.“Over the past 3-4 years, we made significant investments in new plants, thus creating organic growth platforms for our energy and materials businesses. Our new age businesses have shown strong resilience and sustainable growth potential for 1.3 billion Indians as well as Reliance, and will surely script a glorious chapter in our golden decade,” Chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a letter to shareholders.Ambani referred to the year 2017-18 as a “watershed year” in the history of RIL given the growth of its broadband venture Jio, and the completion of its expansion in the material business, which has given the company strong position globally.“Our aim is to have the consumer business contribute on a par with the energy and material businesses over the next decade when we celebrate the golden jubilee,” he said.RIL did not give specific details of the Rs 20,000-crore NCD issue and its utilisation plan. “The board may, at an appropriate time, consider offering or inviting subscriptions for secured or unsecured redeemable non-convertible debentures, in one or more series or tranches on private placement, issuable or redeemable at par, in order to augment long-term resources for financing inter alia the ongoing capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes,” the company said.In the 2017 Annual General Meeting, RIL had taken shareholders’ approval to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore through similar NCD issuance and it raised Rs 20,000 crore through private placement of redeemable non-convertible debentures.RIL’s oil and gas business continued to face headwinds due to declining volumes and soft prices in FY18. “KGD6 gas production declined by 27 per cent for the year to 67.9 BCF due to natural decline of field and shut-in of two D1D3 and one MA wells,” the company said.RIL had earlier indicated that it is going to shut operations at three wells at KGD6. RIL made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin, which included its only oil discovery block MA and D1 and D3 blocks.“Reliance’s near term aim is to maintain wells flowing and sustain production until future projects are commissioned. This involves effective reservoir and production management to overcome network and operational challenges,” the report said.Along with its joint venture partner BP, RIL plans to invest Rs 40,000 crore to develop the discovered deep-water resources in KG D6 block.Development work for R-cluster field has commenced, while field development plans for MJ and satellite cluster fields have been approved by the government. Reliance said these facilities are expected to come on stream in the next 3-5 years.The report also said chairman Ambani has left his salary unchanged at Rs 15 crore for the 10th consecutive year, while other whole time directors such as Nikhil Meswani, Hital Meswani and PMS Prasad saw significant increases in remuneration in 2017-18.“Compensation of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, has been set at Rs 15 crore, reflecting his desire to continue to set a personal example for moderation in managerial compensation levels,” the report said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-plans-to-raise-up-to-rs-20000-crore-via-ncds-in-fy19/articleshow/64501960.cms

French President Emmanuel Macron, who has invested in a warm personal relationship with Trump, said the other G7 nations - Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan, as well as France - should remain “polite” and productive but warned that “no leader is forever,” a sign that Europe would not surrender meekly to the U.S. president. Maybe the American president doesn’t care about being isolated today, but we don’t mind being six, if needs be,” Macron told reporters. India and Iran to Begin Trade Talks India will soon begin talks with Iran on a trade accord just as the US has turned hostile toward the Persian Gulf nation. The first round of formal negotiations on a preferential trade agreement (PTA) will be held between India and Iran by August.

2018-06-10,"An international arbitration tribunal has concluded hearing in the USD 1.55 billion claims made against Reliance Industries and its partners for allegedly siphoning gas from deposits they had no right to exploit and is expected to pronounce a judgement next month.The panel headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Lawrence Boo has concluded hearings on the validity of the government's demand that Reliance and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources pay for ""unfairly"" producing natural gas belonging to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), sources privy to the development said. The three-member panel is likely to give its award in July, they said. Boo, a professor at universities in China, Australia and Singapore, and head of the Singapore-based Arbitration Chambers, was last year appointed as president of the tribunal by its two other members -- government's arbitrator and former Supreme Court Judge G S Singhvi and Reliance-appointed arbitrator, former English High Court Justice Bernard Eder. The oil ministry on November 4, 2016, slapped a demand of USD 1.47 billion on Reliance-BP-Niko combine for producing in seven years ending March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from ONGC's blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal. After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on Reliance, BP and Niko. At the time, Reliance disputed the government's demand as being based on a ""misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC,"" and it said that such a demand was without precedent in the oil and gas industry. It on November 11, 2016, slapped an arbitration notice. Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources. The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been ""unjust enrichment"" to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to the production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML. It relied on a report produced by petroleum industry consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton which concluded that gas had migrated from ONGC-controlled parts of the sea floor and the geological formations beneath it into areas controlled by the private companies. But Reliance had at that time stated that the methods were flawed. The government, sources said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from Reliance-BP-Niko for ""the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained"". So, a notice was sent, they said, adding that the government is also pressing Reliance to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than the target. The cost recovery issue is being arbitrated separately. Originally, ONGC had sued Reliance for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of Reliance. Under the direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah, however, said the compensation should go to the government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/arbitration-award-in-reliance-ongc-gas-row-next-month/articleshow/64527821.cms
2018-06-11,"The advertising watchdog’s fast track panel on complaints has upheld a complaint by Bharti Airtel against Reliance Jio's advertisements that claimed its data network being the best and the largest, and said the ads were misleading by “ambiguity” and “implication”.Upholding other complaints of Airtel, the Fast Track Complaints Panel (FTCP) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) ruled that Jio’s claims of “best entertainment” through television commercials and YouTube ads, was not substantiated.ET reviewed a copy of the interim ruling. In a statement issued on Sunday, however, Jio said the advertising panel was yet to take a final decision, and termed Airtel's allegations as “frivolous”. “This is another instance of an incumbent dominant operator thwarting every initiative of a new entrant to offer state-of-the-art digital services to Indian consumers,” it said.It’s the latest in a series of fights over advertisements between the two. They are involved in a bitter duel for subscribers in the market through tariffs and other means such as content and other services, besides speed of their networks, where, according to experts, perception is sometimes more important than actuals.In mid-May, Airtel had complained that there was no basis — either through clarification or independent third-party data — for Jio to substantiate its claims made in its advertisements, and, therefore, they were violated ASCI code. There are larger networks than Jio in the world and also those that provide better benefits and are faster in terms of speed, it said. Airtel alleged that Jio was aiming to entice and lure viewers to subscribe to its network through misrepresentation.“This complaint was upheld. The TVC and the YouTube advertisement contravened Chapter 1.4 of the ASCI Code,” the panel said on the three separate complaints filed by Airtel against Jio’s claims of best and largest network, best entertainment and best post-paid offers.The observations are interim, with the next date of meeting between the panel and Jio set for June 18.“The FTCP was of the opinion that ‘data consumption’ cannot be the parameter to claim ‘largest mobile data network’. The infrastructure as well as the number of subscribers, are important parameters for which the complainant provided evidence that China Mobile Ltd has larger number of 4G base stations as well as subscriber base,"" the panel said. It said the claim refers to only ""consumption of data"" and not the extent and infrastructure of network.The panel said Jio's claims of offering the “best post-paid offers” was misleading by “omission” since it is not clear what aspect of the advertiser’s product was being compared with what aspects of competitors’ products.Jio, however, said the matter was still under discussion with ASCI. “We believe that the recommendations at this stage do not reflect the submissions made and favourable views expressed by ASCI during the course of discussions. We have followed up with further submissions and clarifications so that the right decision is made,” a Jio spokesperson said in response to ET’s queries.The latest salvo follows complaints that Jio had made earlier made to ASCI about Airtel's speed claims and in courts against its campaign of broadcasting IPL matches in partnership with Hotstar.“Telecom is the new cola in the hands of the new consumer of new India. The category is about speed. And speed is therefore the cutting edge USP. The battle happens here,” said brand consultant Harish Bijoor.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/ad-council-panel-upholds-airtel-plaint-against-reliance-jio/articleshow/64535619.cms

2018-06-11,"By Bhuma Shrivastava and Saket SundriaReliance Industries Ltd. is making room to add as much as 200 billion rupees ($3 billion) to borrowings, using its cash buffer to manage rising funding costs and $13 billion of maturities over the next three years.The billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led company will seek approval to issue redeemable non-convertible debentures at its July 5 shareholder meeting in Mumbai, it said in its latest annual report, without specifying how the money will be used. Reliance has total debt of about $33 billion, more than half of which is due for repayment by 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The retail-to-refining conglomerate’s debt has tripled over five years as it invested $37 billion in a telecom venture and to bolster its traditional petrochemicals business. Its latest plan extends a strategy of raising cheaper debt, riding on its better-than-sovereign ratings, while also actively investing about $12 billion in reserves to generate returns.The cash “helps them manage their debt-raising at the most optimal interest rates,” Vishal Kulkarni, a Singapore-based analyst at S&P Global Ratings, wrote in an email. “Historically the company has been able to keep their cash invested in financial assets that provided returns more than their costs of funding -- thereby avoiding any negative costs of carry.”A spokesman for Reliance didn’t immediately respond to an email and phone call seeking comment.Reliance is rated BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings, two levels higher than the Indian government. Spreads on its 2025 bonds rose to 165 basis points over US Treasuries on Monday, near the widest in more than a year, after touching an all-time low of 117 in November.

Three months are hardly enough to judge the performance of equity mutual fund schemes, especially smallcap schemes. Equity mutual fund schemes can be volatile and risky in the short term. However, they can be extremely rewarding in the long term. That is why equity schemes are recommended only if the investor has an investment horizon of at least five to seven years.Also, you are investing in an Equity Linked Saving Scheme or tax-saving mutual fund scheme.

2018-06-12,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm has become India’s third-largest telecom operator by revenue market share, dislodging Kumar Birla-led Idea Cellular and closing in on Vodafone India as its aggressive pricing strategy left rivals struggling.Just 19 months since starting services, Mukesh Ambani-controlled Jio’s revenue market share widened to almost 20% as of March end, according to financial data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).Idea’s RMS slumped to 16.5%, while No. 2 Vodafone India’s share increased to 21%, just a shade above Jio. Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel took its revenue market share to almost 32%, helped in part by its intra-circle roaming pact with Tata Teleservices, whose consumer mobility business the market leader is buying.Jio’s robust RMS numbers come as Idea and Vodafone India prepare to close their much-awaited merger this month, creating a Rs 63,000 crore revenue entity with some 430 million subscribers. Together, Vodafone and Idea will emerge as the market leader with a 37.5% RMS and the biggest user base, followed by Airtel and Jio. “Jio is already No. 1or No. 2 in 18 circles and has over 25% AGR market share in 15 circles,” ICICI Securities said.Jio, which started operations in September 2016 with a nationwide 4G network, reported an over 18% sequential jump in adjusted gross revenue (including national long distance revenue) to Rs 6,300 crore the quarter ended March, while Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea suffered sequential falls of 5.5%, 4.8% and 8.8% on this score to Rs 10,100 crore, Rs 6,700 crore and Rs 5,200 crore, respectively, ICICI Securities said in a note analysing the data collated by Trai, a copy of which was seen by ET.“Given Jio’s strong and sustained RMS growth, it could easily surpass No. 2 carrier Vodafone India (independently) on this metric in the first quarter of FY19,” said Naveen Kulkarni, a telecom analyst at Phillip Capital.Sanjesh Jain, a telecom research analyst at ICICI Securities, said Jio’s strong revenue share gains may have been triggered by “Bharti, Vodafone and Idea seeing sequential AGR growth in merely six, five and two circles, respectively, out of the 22 circles in the March quarter.” AGR refers to adjusted gross revenue, which is derived from licensed services.He added that Jio may have benefitted as Bharti, Vodafone India and Idea’s average revenue per user dipped by over 45% on-year in seven, two and eight circles, respectively, with customers likely switching to Jio to make outgoing calls, which are free, and using their older carrier connections to receive incoming calls.Goldman Sachs said the Trai data showed that “in 16 of the 22 telecom service areas, Jio is now a top 2 operator” in terms of AGR. Trai data, however, showed that the overall industry’s AGR shrank 8.2% on-quarter to Rs 31,800 crore.Goldman Sachs attributed the sequential fall in industry AGR during the March quarter to price cuts in January, reduction in international long distance termination rates and revenue consolidation among large players.Analysts expect the eroding revenue of Jio’s rivals to stabilise in the first quarter of FY19, with the tariff environment largely stable over the past few months and the rapid conversion of subscribers to data.Goldman Sachs said Airtel has the ability to defend its market share and boost profit when the tariff environment starts improving, given its strong network footprint and balance sheet. The recent acquisition of Telenor India, it said, “is likely to contribute an additional 1percentage point” to Bharti’s revenue market share in FY19.The US brokerage predicts “a 300-400 bps slower revenue growth for Idea vs Bharti over the next couple of years” owing to the former’s lower capital expenditure and investment in networks. Brokerage UBS said Bharti, Vodafone, Idea, Jio and the BSNL-MTNL combine collectively accounted for 98.2% of industry AGR and 91.1% of subscriber market share in the March quarter, implying that the remaining are fringe carriers.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-third-largest-telcom-by-revenue-market-share/articleshow/64550327.cms

The lenders had rejected their bid in the first round as well.“The tribunal has not asked the bidder to reconsider their offer. But lenders have been asked to reconsider their decision,” said a bank official. The offer of Rs 5,050 crore would translate to an 83 per cent haircut for lenders. The RBI has asked banks to make 100 per cent provision on accounts where resolution failed and the court ordered liquidation.Lenders such as IDBI Bank, Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Dena Bank were among those that voted against the offer, although their respective stands on the revised bid could not be independently verified with each bank.The 270-day window for arriving at a resolution plan ended in the middle of April, 2018, following which the RP suggested liquidation of Alok Industries.

2018-06-15,"Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor talks to ET Now, talks about TCS buyback, Reliance hitting new highs and largecap versus midcaps.Edited excerpts:If one were to rationalise the 15% premium on CMP for TCS buyback price, from the point of view of where the management sees value in the business, then one can understand the market excitement. This has been almost like a pattern for the management where they are going to give excess free cashflows every year as buyback to shareholders. Do you think this will be par for the course where investors would tender to get that upside?Yes, why not? Especially for a company which has surplus cash and do not really need to be reinvested in the business for future growth. It is not just prudent, it is essential that they return it back to the investors in one form or the other. TCS has chosen the buyback route. Last year, they did one of a similar size, this year they intend to do one more. Dividends are another option basically to get the surplus cash off the balance sheet. It not just improves the earnings on the same base of profits, it also improves the return on equity and return on capital. So, really nothing to complain about from that perspective. I do not know whether it is a tender offer buyback.It is a tender offer.So, then it is a fixed price buyback because otherwise a number of companies also do a market purchase buyback, where they fix a maximum and a minimum price and within that, they continue to do a buyback over a three to six-month period.I do not think they ever did a auction based buyback.Yes, last year also was a tender offering.Reliance has hit record highs. How do you see the story from here at this price point?Upwards of Rs 1000, I would be cautious about Reliance and about making any fresh investments at these levels. The view goes from a larger perspective that I see the market itself is correcting. The Sensex and the Nifty may be drifting lower and Reliance as a heavyweight cannot be at the same levels as they are currently.How are you reading the market right now? Is there any sense in looking at any of the bottom up stories?As far as the bottom-up stories are concerned, there clearly is greater comfort in largecap names. Some of the Nifty names probably give more comfort than trying to bottom fish in the small and mid-cap space. We are almost done with the result season for the fourth quarter and more largecap companies met analyst expectations than the small and midcap companies. Small and midcap companies even today are available at a premium to their largecap peers. It is very difficult to believe and I cannot find comfort in investing in a midcap company which is trading at a significant premium to its largecap peer within the same sector or within the same group. Just to give you a sense, within autos -- whether it is Maruti or Bajaj Auto or Hero MotorCorp -- most have corrected but not as much as small and midcaps. The valuations are within the vicinity of 15-20 times one year forward earnings, all of them debt free, generate return on capital, return on equity upwards of 20-25%. But if you look at some of the midcap names within the auto, auto ancillary space, they are trading at significant premium. Why do I need to go for bottom up stock picking when I could find the Nifty names which give me greater comfort across sectors. TCS probably will give greater comfort than bottom-fishing in any of the mid-cap IT space. So, why venture out when TCS, Infosys give you greater comfort?So, each and every mid-cap according to you is not worth it at this point of time. How selective would you be if we restrict our discussion to auto space?It is not that every mid-cap is trading at a huge premium but that does not give me comfort. I was making a general comment.. Like I gave the example that your large IT versus the mid-cap IT. It is not that the large companies are not giving you high teens or 20-25% growth rates, in a large number of companies you have that. It is not that the midcaps have delivered the 30-40% growth rates that we would like them. Over the last several quarters, a lot of the high flying names popular among the trading community actually have not delivered those high growth rates. My question is if those high growth rates are not there. then why are we paying for 30-40 or 50 times earnings? , If I have to play for growth rates between 15% and 25%, then there are a number of largecaps which can give me that.

2018-06-16,"KOLKATA: Reliance Communications (RCom) has returned about 70 units of unliberalised, or non-auctioned, spectrum in the 1800 Mhz band to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), having found no takers, mainly since it involved paying over Rs 1,500 crore to the government before being used for 4G services.The Anil Ambani-led telco took the call after deciding to shut its wireless business in November, since there were no takers for these airwaves which couldn’t be used for 4G services without liberalising them, a person familiar with the matter said.This would mean paying DoT the difference in the cost of the startup spectrum allocated to RCom about 20 years ago and the current market price, or about Rs 1,500 crore.Additionally, the spectrum in about 15 circles was valid only until July-September 2021, the person added.Reliance Jio Infocomm--which is buying a big chunk of RCom’s airwaves and is also reckoned to be keen to buy the telco’s unsold, liberalised spectrum in the 850 Mhz band--was not interested in the administered spectrum, the person said. RCom has about 70 units of 850 Mhz spectrum to offer.RCom and Jio did not reply to ET’s queries.Industry circles now expect Jio to sign a follow-up Rs 4,000 crore deal to acquire RCom’s unsold 850 Mhz spectrum, especially since the government has recently eased spectrum cap rules by removing the 50% limit put on carriers holding airwaves within each band, post-mergers.The buyout of Reliance Communications’ spectrum assets will take Jio’s countrywide airwave holdings to 1,106 units, surpassing Airtel’s 1088.7 Mhz and the combined Vodafone-Idea entity’s 1132.5 Mhz, according to spectrum data collated by brokerage UBS.More importantly, access to RCom's unsold 850 MHz airwaves will boost Jio's pan-India holdings in this efficient band that would significantly improve the quality of its 4G LTE coverage, VoLTE offerings and indoor broadband coverage. Vodafone India and Idea are currently undergoing a merger.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/anil-ambanis-reliance-communications-return-spectrum-in-1800-mhz-band-to-telecom-department/articleshow/64609671.cms
2018-06-16,"Thailand is spearheading a new Southeast Asian fund for infrastructure and development projects, Thai prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told a summit in Bangkok on Saturday, a bid to counter reliance on Asian giants, such as China. The fund, which Thailand will jointly manage with four countries of the region - Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam - is expected to begin operations in 2019. ""Thailand wants to emphasise the importance of a sustainable source of funding,"" Prayuth told a summit of the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS). One of its aims is to lessen reliance on funding from China and other regional giants, said Arthayud Srisamoot, an official of the foreign ministry. ""There is a sense among these countries to try to engage more within this region before going out to China, to South Korea, Japan and India."" Thailand would contribute a ""substantial amount of money"" to start the fund, he added. Prayuth gave no details of the project's size or budget but the Thai government said officials of all five countries would meet this year to flesh out details. The fund will raise money through the sale of stocks and bonds by issuing debt for projects, Arthayud said, adding that it would welcome financial contributions from countries and institutions beyond Southeast Asia. Previous regional infrastructure projects of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping have made little progress, because of conflicting interests. China has been investing heavily in infrastructure in Southeast Asia, in line with its Belt and Road initiative, as well as in energy and property, which has spurred concern about the region's growing economic dependence on it. China has committed to spending nearly $12 billion in loans and grants in Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. At a regional summit this year in Cambodia, one of the region's top beneficiaries of Chinese investment, government leaders agreed to consider a second batch of Chinese-funded projects, in addition to 132 projects approved in 2016. Chinese-backed infrastructure projects in the region include a $5.5-billion railway scheme to link Thailand's eastern seaboard with southern China, via land-locked Laos.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/thailand-spearheads-regional-fund-to-cut-reliance-on-big-asian-economies/articleshow/64612440.cms

2018-06-18,"Reliance Brands, owned by India’s largest retail chain Reliance Retail, is in the final stages of negotiations to buy out Genesis Luxury, a group company of private equity fund Sequoia Capital-backed Genesis Colors, for an estimated Rs 450 crore, two persons with direct knowledge of the plan said.The country’s biggest retailer, which had in September last year, bought private equity fund L Catterton Asia’s 40% stake in Genesis Luxury, will now buy the remaining stake from the PE funds and owner Sanjay Kapoor. While Reliance Retail did not respond to ET’s emailed questionnaire, Reliance Brands CEO Darshan Mehta was unavailable for comment. Genesis Luxury owner Sanjay Kapoor too declined to comment till press-time Sunday.The acquisition of one of India’s top luxury groups is likely to give Reliance a dominant space in the country’s booming luxury market, and gives it an edge when it comes to bargaining for real estate concessions, overhead costs and other benefits. LCatterton, one of the early investors in Genesis Luxury, had picked up the 40% stake in the firm over a period of six years for Rs 135 crore (approximately $21.3 million).Genesis Luxury sells a diverse brands including Burberry, Canali, Paul Smith, Armani, Just Cavalli and Jimmy Choo. Reliance Brands is an arm of Reliance Retail and is one of the largest retail distributors for luxury and mass brands in India. Retail consultants said Reliance’s acquisition of the luxury brands is a long-term strategy to stay invested before the markets open up further.“The luxury market in India is growing pretty well at 15% or more, and it is still under-penetrated,” said Harminder Sahni, founder, Wazir Advisors, a retail consultancy firm. “Reliance with its deep pockets is smartly cornering that space with its multi-layering strategy of getting in several luxury brands that will address consumers from the entry level of the market to its highest end. It is clearly a long term strategy of staying invested much before the markets open up further,” said Singh.Reliance Retail, which operates over 424 stores, has a portfolio of over 40 international brands that spans across the entire spectrum of luxury, bridge-to-luxury, highpremium and high-street lifestyle. Reliance Brands operates under two business models — first, through a joint venture in which it owns a minority or majority equity, and second, as a master franchisee model.It started operations in October 2007 by selling both local and global brands and simultaneously building brands in the premium to luxury segment across apparels, footwear and lifestyle business. Reliance Brands is betting big on gaining a larger share of the luxury market. In September last year, after it bought L Catterton Asia’s 40% stake in Genesis Luxury, its direct competitor in luxury retail, it inked a deal in June with Italian brand Valentino to bring the brand to India.Reliance Brands’ portfolio includes Amsterdam-based fashion brand Scotch & Soda and Kate Spade New York apart from partnerships with 18 global mid-to-luxury brands including Diesel, Hamleys, Steve Madden, Timberland, Kenneth Cole, Ermenegildo Zegna, and Paul & Sharks. Management consulting firm Technopak estimated that the fashion retail market, worth $46 billion in 2017, will grow at a promising CAGR of 9.7% to reach $115 billion by 2026.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-brands-in-talks-to-buy-genesis-luxury/articleshow/64627458.cms

2018-06-21,"Russia’s Sistema JSFC has fully sold its 10% stake in Reliance Communications in multiple tranches over the past few months, becoming the latest foreign operator to exit the troubled Indian telecom market, having lost about $4 billion on its investments.The Russian conglomerate is believed to have given up the idea of buying RCom’s remaining telecom assets, comprising subsea cables, enterprise business and data centres, following differences with the Anil Ambani-led telco, said people aware of the matter.In response to ET’s queries, a Sistema spokesman confirmed that the company “has sold off its entire stake in RCom” but did not comment on the company’s interest in the rest of RCom assets.RCom declined to comment on the matter.Sistema JSFC took a call to exit RCom after the beleaguered telco had recently got embroiled in insolvency proceedings, a person with direct knowledge told ET on condition of anonymity. He said that the Russian company was no longer keen on making ambitious investments in India’s brutally competitive and fast consolidating telecom market, having already burnt its fingers.It had sold its Indian mobile telephony business, Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL), to RCom in return for a 10% stake in October 2017.RCom has also since shut its wireless business? amid plunging revenue and mounting losses due to intense competition, and operates only an enterprise business, besides running data centres and sub-sea cables.RCom shares were trading at nearly Rs 80 apiece when the RCom-SSTL merger deal was announced in early November 2015, but had slumped to around Rs 17 when the deal was finally completed in late October 2017. On Wednesday, RCom shares ended the session at Rs 15.30 apiece on the Bombay Stock Exchange, with a gain of 4.8% over the previous close.In recent months, Sistema has progressively reduced its stake in RCom. In March, it lowered its stake to 7.09% by letting minority shareholders swap their shares with those of RCom. In April and May, it sold off a further 2.1% and 0.55% respectively in the open market, lowering its equity holding in RCom to 4.43%.Another person said the shareholders’ agreement between the two companies “allowed Sistema to sell off its remaining shares in RCom, if its stake fell below 7%”.It could not be ascertained, however, how Sistema JSFC plans to recover the $300 million (about Rs 2,000 crore) that RCom will owe it if the Supreme Court backs the Russian conglomerate in its continuing legal tussle against the Department of Telecommunications (DoT)’s demand for $600 million as contiguity charges for spectrum won by SSTL in the March 2013 auctions.If the apex court backs SSTL, then RCom – which acquired SSTL’s spectrum – will be the holder of 4G-ready 800 MHz airwaves whose valuation will stand enhanced by roughly $600 million at no extra cost. Under the terms of the merger and acquisition deal, RCom would need to equally compensate Sistema JSFC by paying it half the enhanced value or $300 million, said one of the persons cited. The Supreme Court is slated to hear the spectrum contiguity charges matter on July 10.A third person said the Russian company had also “dropped out of the race to buy RCom’s remaining telecom assets” which included its subsea cables housed under its overseas arm Global Cloud Exchange (GCX).While Sistema JSFC wanted only RCom’s domestic enterprise business and about nine data centres that are collectively valued at $600 million, the latter had categorically said it would not selectively sell its telecom assets.

2018-06-21,"Shares of oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries scaled fresh all-time highs in early trade on Thursday. The stock has been on an upward trajectory for the past one year. It hit an all-time high of Rs 1,031 in early Thursday, rising from Rs 709 on June 21 last year.Chartists are still bullish on the stock and advising market participants to consider holding RIL in their portfolios. The stock has been rangebound over the past couple of months. However, it has attempted to break out from a multi-month rectangle formation. It has, thus, made an attempt to move up after a throwback it had suffered.“RIL is in a multi-month consolidation phase since December 2017 and appears to be on the verge of a breakout from this consolidation zone. On any breakout with a sustainable close above Rs 1,025, it shall open up a new target around Rs 1,150 level. Even fresh buying can be considered at current levels. Our positive outlook will get negated on a close below Rs 980, as the stock may then slip into a short-term downtrend,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist for Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory said, “The stock enjoys strong support in the Rs 990-1,000 zone. Given the much wider-than-normal Bollinger bands on the daily chart, the stock may continue to move within a range for some time. However, investors with a medium- to long-term horizon can accumulate the stock. They can expect good returns over next two quarters. Any move that takes the stock below Rs 980 would be negative.”The company has sought shareholders’ approval to raise up to Rs 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in 2018-19, according to its annual report for FY18.RIL said its oil and gas business continued to face headwinds due to declining volumes, especially as it shutin’ three operational wells at its Krishna-Godavari D6 basin.While it cautioned on its shale gas business, RIL said it is poised to become one of the largest non-conventional gas producers in India with the ramp up of its coal bed methane (CBM) production that crossed 1 mscmd.“Over the past 3-4 years, we made significant investments in new plants, thus creating organic growth platforms for our energy and materials businesses. Our new age businesses have shown strong resilience and sustainable growth potential for 1.3 billion Indians as well as Reliance, and will surely script a glorious chapter in our golden decade,” Chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a letter to shareholders.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-scales-new-high-chartists-say-more-steam-left-in-the-stock/articleshow/64677032.cms
2018-06-21,"Nifty will try to retest the new highs in the next 90 to 100 days. It will be driven by Reliance and the tech pack, Harendra Kumar, MD–Institutional Equities, Elara Capital, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:India has upped import duty on some chemicals but what is the whole impact on the imposition of tariffs on imports of steel and iron ore?India’s major surplus from the US is not from steel and iron, it is more from software services. It is not impacting India domestic steel manufacturers so much. In fact, rupee depreciation is a positive and the overall global rise in steel prices are a big variable, given that our local prices are reset on import parity.The overall move towards increasing tariffs worldwide means that the average selling price worldwide is increasing with real demand. India is the only place where actual demand and steel prices are nudging upwards. Overall, in this game, India stands to benefit at least on the metal side.Is it too early to assess the net impact of these tariffs being slapped across the world? What about its effect on global growth, on growth in the US and China as also the net impact on India as well?The net impact is being felt today in the markets. The way China is falling off the radar and India outperforming emerging markets means that the market is recognising that we are a domestic-oriented economy and quite resilient from the pyrotechnics of global trade wars. The effect could be very positive for the Indian markets and this reflect in how the Nifty has been holding up.How should one approach oil PSUs? Nomura in its latest note believes that they are attractive after the recent correction. Do you find merit in looking at OMCs right now?For that we have to track the crude actually. The selloff happened when the government went into a silent mode while crude was going up. They did not clarify their position on marketing margins or for that matter on how petrol prices will move up. What the OMCs can do in this situation, what the government intends to do and whether they would want the OMCs to keep the profits etc.Because of this uncertainty, the stock prices have come off. Till the crude price uncertainty continues on where it is going to settle, one should stay away from OMCs. They always look attractive and cheap at certain price levels but we have to understand the global dynamic of a deflationary trade over a falling crude price, falling interest rate is over. In the next two to three years, you might see interest rates going up and crude or commodities remaining firm.In that context, we are not so comfortable with OMCs holding up. Gas is a much better place than OMCs.Within gas names, would you be stock specific?That space is pretty much categorised. CGD companies with steady volume growth like Indraprastha Gas or a Mahanagar Gas. An interesting story is emerging in Gujarat Gas and Gujarat State Petronet, given the differential in fuel oil where the migration from fuel oil to gas is happening. The stocks are cheap as well. Plus, there is an industry revival which is reflecting in volume growth. Frankly, Indraprastha Gas or a GAIL are structural buys. You have two extremely cheap stocks that could generate more alpha than some of the other gas names.Where are you building conviction in the market right now? Are you advising clients to stay off because the markets are largely going to be range bound? Where do you see an alpha opportunity?Between Reliance and TCS, the market will go to new highs. The context remains the same. The broader Nifty could struggle but Nifty will try to retest the new highs in the next 90 to 100 days. That will be driven by Reliance and the tech pack. This is where a lot of value plus a rerating momentum continues. In the rest of the index space, private banking looks very strong, This is where potential trading action is going to be over next 3-4 months.What is your take from a common investor perspective?The market landscape is changing. There are select opportunities for some midcaps but you have to be selective out there because as we have seen in other midcaps the scalability of midcaps beyond a point of time becomes questionable. One will have to cherry pick and be very, very selective. There is still some value in some of the IT midcaps which are trading at very low teens PE multiples but so also some of the large cap names. While the midcap rerates the large caps continues to look very attractive. While we stay selective in midcaps, a larger trade is available on some of the large cap names.Is there merit in relooking at ICICI Bank or Axis Bank as there is clarity on which way the top leadership is going to head?I would still be cagey about ICICI Bank. I had mentioned before the results as well that the stock is over owned. All the triggers have played out in terms of listing of all the subsidiaries but the stock has actually not delivered. The placement of a new COO would mean that you are wishing away the complexities of the resolution of this problem. I am not too sure. Frankly for me, alpha is coming from IndusInd, Kotak or an HDFC Bank. There is more alpha generation there than potentially some of the names that you have mentioned. We would like to be overweight on the other three that I have mentioned rather than ICICI Bank or Axis Bank over the medium term.What would be your top avoid in the market right now or best bet for profit taking in some pockets?People are trying to bottom fish in pharma. It was a trading pop that you just witnessed over some days. There there are no structural changes that could drive return ratios or top line profits. I would say that companies that are over owned and still potentially stuck. in these names one can look for liquidation.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-and-tcs-could-take-markets-to-new-highs-harendra-kumar-elara-capital/articleshow/64677234.cms
2018-06-21,"Quality companies are very expensive but there is not enough economic momentum to pull up the second rung of managements and business models, Manish Gunwani, CIO Equities, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:We are half way into the year and three months into the financial year. The calendar year is what global markets follow; for our local markets, we draw cues from the financial year given the earnings profile. How do you see things stacking up?Definitely from the global side, we are seeing some challenges to India’s position because we have seen the dollar appreciate sharply. While world growth has remained reasonably strong at the margin, the data from Europe, Japan and China is not that strong. This means that US continues to be the strongest performing developed market which obviously implies that the dollar has a positive outlook as of now. As long as dollar is strong, you clearly will see stress on emerging market inflows. From a liquidity perspective and not so much growth perspective, clearly the global situation is a bit challenging. What is holding up markets is the micro. Both globally and locally, the earnings outlook remains quite benign.Developed market indices like S&P 500 or the MSCI World, have high-teen growth in earnings which for mutual markets is obviously very strong and even in India, the growth outlook is not that big an issue because even in the recent quarterly results, if you ex-out corporate banks, PSU banks and large corporate banks, the earnings growth has been relatively good and over next two-three years when the credit cost of these banks normalises, the overall index earnings to our mind for next two years can kind of compound around 18-20%. While the earnings outlook is relatively benign; a) US bond yield curve is becoming a concern predicting recession and crude prices are still remaining relatively elevated. b)on the domestic side, there is the uncertainty of going into a very sensitive political calendar six months from now. These are the challenges. Last year was great. From that base, any marginal disappointment tends to hit the market quite strongly.Given the landscape and the picture that you are painting right now, would we have to accept the fact that the market is going to be range bound and volatile one in next few months for Indian equities. Within that also, would this divergence between large and midcaps remain so?It does look like a year in which volatility is going to be very high. We also have to remember that from mid 2016 to end of 2017 was a very exceptional period in terms of probably the lowest volatility for many decades. Markets tend to overcorrect. We clearly think volatility will be very high and yes in terms of returns also given the base we had last year, although this is becoming something of a consensus, you need to be a bit cautious about the stance. But yes, it is a fact that valuations are mixed. Quality companies are very expensive but there is not enough economic momentum to pull up the second rung of managements and business models. So valuations are mixed but on an aggregate basis, it is slightly higher than long-term averages. We have a very mixed picture where earnings outlook is not so bad but both global and domestic macros are bit of a challenge. It does look like a year where the returns can be quite moderate.You had a tough task at hand over the last three months in finding opportunities where you can generate alpha?We tend to stick to the themes we have. Some of the themes we like are the large corporate banks from two-three year perspective. While we may see volatility in numbers in the next two-three quarters because of RBI provisioning norms, etc, over next two-three years, we are expecting credit cost to come down to close to long-term averages and therefore we find those stocks quite attractive. We like a mix of sectors like pharma and some select stocks in consumer discretionary. Although that space generally is a bit expensive, but obviously there are a lot of segments where either the penetration is very low or the cycle has been very prolonged.The down cycle has been quite prolonged and some green shoots are emerging in some segments of consumer discretionary, infra as well some pockets of engineering, road construction and logistics so there is a mix of these kind of themes.You are saying that there are still pockets within the side markets which are still sitting at expensive valuations, waiting to correct. What is it that you would steer clear of when it comes to the broader markets. You identified that there are pockets of opportunity within that. If you could get a little bit more specific as to what exactly do you like within the mid and smallcaps?The valuations are clearly very high in consumer staples and consumer discretionaries. These are all very high-quality companies but the price to earnings multiples have expanded quite substantially. In this landscape, we are seeing some value in sectors like general insurance and even life insurance which are relatively underpenetrated, third party logistics which again is quite underpenetrated in India and some NBFCs which are catering to auto and gold financing, and which we think have a serious competitive edge over banks.While the macro is challenging, we should keep in mind that the outlook on crude at above $80 looks difficult because OPEC itself seems to indicate that they will increase production around that level. One year down the line, my guess is the macro would not look that bad because we have seen a very sharp y-o-y increase in crude on a currency basis. Also y-o-y has depreciated.The outlook on inflation in case of good monsoon seems to be that food inflation could be relatively muted. Also, fuel inflation probably one year down the line could be relatively muted. The macro is not probably bad from a very structural sense but more from this year’s perspective, combined with the fact that we are clearly seeing these things like trade wars etc. Coming back to your question, insurance, logistics and NBFCs are the spaces where we are overweight.As a fund manager, what is it you are seeing within the retail participants? Is there a lot of fear now? Are you seeing some redemption pressure coming in for the small and mid-cap schemes? Are largecaps a clear and obvious choice now?Not really. The industry numbers from May are pretty good. We are not seeing any sign of panic yet. This year is challenging, but if you see the overall trend, hopefully India is structurally moving to a lower interest rate regime from a medium to long term view perspective. A lot of the inflationary components -- oil prices, real estate prices, -- over next three to five years will not be that strong. It is unlikely that physical assets look very attractive in the medium term whether you are talking of commodities, real estate or gold. As long as that is the case, while we may see some volatility in the markets which could affect flows sometimes, the trend of financialization of savings from physical assets to financial assets, seems to be very strong at this point of time. The recent buys in Reliance Growth Fund as per our indications are Imami, PNB Housing Finance, KRBL, Berger Paints, Exide Industries. That is a mixed bag but consumption is largely your play over here. You have increased holdings in Thomas Cook, InfoEdge, RBL Bank, Torrent Power. Decreased holdings include Chola Investments, PTC India and some of the recently exited names include MRF, Century Textiles and Maharashtra Seamless. On balance, your top 10 holdings have between 2.5% and 3% allocations each. How are you are looking to balance out returns when it comes to Reliance Growth Fund.Our philosophy in Reliance Growth is just to look at companies where we think over three to five years earnings can double or companies which are coming back from a downcycle or high quality companies at a reasonable valuation. The themes broadly again include NBFCs where we see a competitive advantage against banks, domestic facing pharma names where the valuations are at a fairly big discount to FMCG names. The third theme is consumer discretionary. But these are hidden names, not standard FMCG names where they are providing services to consumer companies and the valuation is much cheaper than frontline consumer names. Insurance, again where we think penetration levels in India are quite low. If you see the portfolio broadly, a lot of names will fall into these kinds of themes. How critical would crude as well as rupee be as a moving part to the markets? There is an impending OPEC meet in Vienna over the weekend and that hopefully should give us some more clarity on which way crude prices are headed. We could be headed for an all-time low on the currency. In my view, rather than looking at crude, we should look at trade deficit and current account deficit. But current account deficit data comes with a big lag. Most of the bull runs in emerging markets and India happen with rising crude prices. The rising crude price is negative for India but when world growth is strong, commodities will have an upward bias.Also, India tends to do well when world growth is strong because capital flows are very strong at that point of time. Now, what has been a bit of a disappointment over the last two years is the fact that Indian exports have not shown big elasticity to world growth.Given India’s share of global trade of about 2.5% and given the size of our economy and population, you would expect that we should be growing faster than global trade but the data over the last two years when world growth has been relatively strong shows that Indian exports have not outperformed global trade. This is a big disappointment. If your exports are growing at 8-10-12% when world growth is strong, then the other part of the equation of trade deficit is imports, where crude price is very high and any $10-20 move in crude tends to push your current account deficit to 2-2.5% which is considered the boundary for becoming worried about current account deficit. So yes, crude is obviously then very important but the silver lining is that OPEC seems to indicate that they do not want oil prices to go much above $80. Of course, any geopolitical situation can change that but at this point, the positive for India seems to be that we probably have seen the worst of the crude move and it is behind us.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/guard-up-for-a-volatile-year-when-returns-could-be-moderate-manish-gunwani-reliance-nippon-life-amc/articleshow/64680380.cms

On Monday, it traded at Rs 1,013 apiece, up just 0.14 per cent.On Monday, Mint reported that RIL was considering the IPO of its telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm in two to three years. The news first hit the market in December 2017, when Bloomberg reported about plans of the Mukesh Ambani firm to bring the IPO by early 2019.Considering the way Jio has disrupted the telecom industry, the IPO is seen as the move of the unicorn to break free from the tag of being a subsidiary of a petroleum refinery firm. Since its inception in September 2016, the firm has seen steady growth, inflicting pain on other telecom players through a cut-throat price war.Jio's emergence has jolted the domestic telecom industry and its competitors have been trying to figure out ways to counter its aggression.

2018-06-26,"NEW DELHI: India’s largest private oil company, Reliance Industries Ltd, and state-run oil refiner-retailers are locked in a dogfight over selling jet fuel to carriers as India is poised to become the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2020.Mumbai airport has become their latest battleground, with Reliance complaining to authorities and regulators that Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum were creating entry barriers by not allowing other jet fuel sellers access to their pipelines feeding the airport.Faced with the situation, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board has invited public comments, announcing its intention to declare the present pipelines as common carrier.Mumbai accounts for more than 20% of jet fuel consumption in the country. The airport is fed jet fuel from BPCL and HPCL refineries in the city’s periphery through two separate pipelines and storage facilities inside and outside the airport. IndianOil, the third state-run oil marketing company, gets its supplies from these two refineries under a barter arrangement.Since there is no viable alternative to these two pipelines, MIAL, the airport operator, formed a joint venture with the three public sectors companies for developing an integrated fuel farm facility that is to operate on open access policy and drive competition.BPCL was appointed as the operator and its subsidiary, Bharat Star Services, and IndianOil Skytanking were given sub-licence to operate bowsers that finally refuel aircraft on a non-discriminatory basis.While work on the integrated facility is on, Reliance has alleged the existing arrangement is monopolised by public sector companies who are thwarting competition by denying others access to infrastructure.The state-run companies deny this, saying the pipelines are not part of the common infrastructure and faced capacity constraints in terms of pipeline size, storage and pumping facilities. They also said the pipelines are catering to all companies, including IndianOil.Reliance says jet fuel accounts for 40% of airlines operating costs and competition will help bring this down. Denial of access to the twin pipeline systems implies denial of access to the integrated fuel farm storage at Mumbai airport and is causing significant entry barriers for other authorised suppliers, which is preventing fair trade competition among entities.They said open and transparent competition in fuel supply becomes even more critical at times of high oil prices which directly impact jet fuel prices.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-industries-government-oil-companies-in-dogfight-over-jet-fuel-sales/articleshow/64743151.cms

2018-06-27,"Consumers of home broadband services can look forward to a bonanza of sorts in coming months with Bharti Airtel ready to engage in another price war once Reliance Jio Infocomm launches its much awaited fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) services later this year.After unleashing brutal price wars in the mobile services space with its disruptive tariffs following its entry in September 2016, the Mukesh Ambani-controlled 4G carrier is now poised to stir a hornet’s nest; this time in the home broadband services front by offering an attractive combo of fast broadband connectivity at initial data speeds of 100 Mbps (with huge dollops of free data thrown in), videos and unlimited voice calls through the Vo-IP (voice over internet protocol) route for around Rs 1,000-1,500 a month.But many expect Jio — which is already running a pilot in many cities — to offer its bouquet for free initially to attract customers, mirroring its strategy in the mobile phone space.A person familiar with the developments hinted that the timing of the commercial launch of Jio’s home broadband services may be revealed at parent Reliance Industries’ upcoming annual general meeting on July 5.Small wonder, Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel is revving up its countrywide wired broadband game to protect turf ahead of Jio’s commercial roll-out of its ultra-fast home broadband services.“We are closely watching the wired home broadband space and will combine innovation with aggressive investments and do whatever it takes to stay competitive on services and tariffs and grow our home customer base,” a senior Bharti Airtel executive told ET.The No.1telco is likely to set aside a sizeable chunk of its Rs 24,000-crore capex guidance for FY19 to expand its pan-India wired broadband network to at least 100 key cities from the 89-odd now, primarily targeting big data consumption zones.In them, the telco has finalised plans to connect another 10 million-plus homes by FY21 that it expects will translate in at least 3-to-5 million new home service customers over the next three years.Airtel is also working to put together a winning brew of offers at attractive rates to hold on to their 2.5 million-strong home broadband customer base. The company has recently offered discounts of 15% and 20% to customers opting for its home broadband packs (offering up to 300 Mbps speeds) for six months and 1 year, respectively.Another key element of Airtel’s home broadband strategy to counter Jio is the chase for full-fledged home customers, who will be incentivised by way of discounts to buy converged telecom products across Airtel’s full services portfolio under its ‘Home Platform’, which will soon go commercial nationally.Under the digital home platform — developed in-house by the company’s innovation team — home customers will, typically, be able to bundle Airtel postpaid mobile and digital TV connections with their high-speed home broadband packs and consolidate all bills into one.It may also roll-out a host of specialised ancillary services for its home broadband customers, including home surveillance solutions and anti-virus tools, said another company executive.Reliance Jio and Airtel did not reply to ET's queries till press time on Wednesday.“An aggressive FTTH services launch by Jio can cause two sets of disruptions, in that, it can immediately disrupt home broadband pricing, forcing rivals such as Airtel to slash rates, and could also have a secondary impact on the larger mobile services market, if Jio chooses to bundle generous wired broadband packs with its current 4G plans,” Rohan Dhamija, partner & head for India, South Asia & Middle East at Analysys Mason, told ET.Airtel has already felt the effects of pre-empting Jio’s launch, being forced to cut rates for some of its plans and increase data allowances.This has led to its home services revenue shrinking nearly 11% on-year to Rs 604.2 crore in the quarter ended March, triggered by 12.6% on-year ARPU dilution. Airtel attributed the fall to “the proliferation of mobile broadband at below-cost rates”.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/bharti-airtel-reliance-jio-set-for-home-broadband-war/articleshow/64769425.cms
2018-06-28,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio has overtaken Vodafone India to become the second largest carrier by revenue in the Indian telecom space, generating revenues of Rs 6,217 crore in the quarter ended March 2018, up 15% on-quarter.The new entrant has also quickly narrowed the gap with leader Bharti Airtel whose revenue was Rs 7,087 crore, down about 10% on-quarter, as per data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).The Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio has been able to dislodge the No. 2 carrier by subscribers within 19 months of launching services where it offered free voice and low-cost data, triggering a price war that shows no signs of abating. The razor-edged competition has created more financial difficulties for the already stressed sector saddled with debt of more than Rs 7 lakh crore.The new carrier has, in fact, escalated the fight of low tariffs, expanding it from the dominant prepaid segment — it makes up 95% of the country’s subscriber base — to the post-paid segment, which makes up the remaining share but contributes around 20-25% of the industry’s revenue.As per the Trai data, the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of Reliance Jio — it has secured more than 200 million customers to date — was higher than Vodafone India’s Rs 4,937 crore for the quarter ended March, and also of Idea Cellular at Rs 4,033 crore.The details have come as Idea and Vodafone India prepare to merge to create a Rs 63,000-crore annual revenue entity with some 430 million subscribers.Together, the AGR of the combined entity would be higher than those of Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.Overall, the industry AGR from access services fell by 12.6% on-year and 7.4% on-quarter for the March quarter to Rs 35,697 crore, with all private players but Jio showing a degrowth. For access services, the revenue decline was12.2% on-quarter to Rs 25,448 crore as of March 2018.Revenue of carriers such as Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices, Quadrant and Telenor declined the sharpest in that order, since they’ve either closed operations or are in the process of doing so. Barring Jio, BSNL is the only carrier to have shown an increase in revenue collection, by a healthy 18% on-quarter to Rs 2,128 crore.License fee and spectrum usage charges (SUC), which accrue to the government as a percentage share of AGR, have also reduced in quarter ended March 2018. Revenue from license fee fell by 12.8% on-year and 5.5% on-quarter to Rs 2,932 crore and that from SUC fell by 23.4% on-year and 8.8% on-quarter to Rs 1,051 crore as of March end. Goldman Sachs attributed the sequential fall in industry AGR during the March quarter to price cuts in January, reduction in international long distance termination rates and revenue consolidation among large players.The escalated competition among incumbents and the new operator has led to reduction in average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric for determining profitability of a telco and of the industry. Trai data show that the blended ARPU per month declined 4.2% on-quarter from Rs 79.4 in the quarter ended December 2017 to Rs 76 in the quarter ended March 2018.Overall ARPU declined 8% on-year. ARPU of pre-paid segment declined from Rs 67 to Rs 62 in the same period, while ARPU for the post-paid segment increased from Rs 348 to Rs 360.As the industry players deal with low ARPU rates, customers are making the most of the free voice offers. Minutes of usage per subscriber have reached 584 minutes per month, up from 495 minutes a month in December 2017.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-pips-vodafone-to-become-number-2-by-revenue/articleshow/64772366.cms

2018-06-29,"New Delhi: Reliance Retail is entering wholesaling of fashion and lifestyle products through both offline and online channels, as the Reliance Industries unit aims to tap the largely unorganised bulk business of garments and accessories.The wholesale business will primarily target millions of small and medium retailers nationwide to supply products in bulk, including its own branded material, sources said. It plans also to service customers through a B2B portal.Reliance Retail has put together a team that is working on a raft of private labels specifically to sell to small and medium retailers, said one of the sources. It is enrolling small and medium independent suppliers as well for the venture, said another person.Reliance Retail already operates a chain of cash and-carry outlets called Reliance Market, which sells food products, FMCG, general merchandise as well as some amount of ready-made garments.

2018-07-02,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio has alleged that tender norms mandating the use of 2G technology for government-funded telecom projects are biased towards India’s older operators and could cause losses of “thousands of crores” of rupees to the public exchequer. In a letter to the Department of Telecommunications dated June 25, the Mukesh Ambani-owned operator said the government’s call to use 2G technology for voice services in its tender for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was “extremely unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory, restrictive” and a “retrograde mandate.” The telco said the tender norms should only “specify service requirements and key performance indicators for required coverage instead of mandating or favouring only one particular technology.” Jio is the only operator offering services based on only 4G technology, while Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular offer 2G, 3G and 4G. The telecom department invited bids in June to install 214 mobile towers in the uncovered villages and on national highways in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Licence holders with the requisite 2G and 4G spectrum in the West Bengal area are eligible to bid, either as sole bidder or as a lead bidder of the consortium, according to the tender notice. The project will be funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund Administrator created from the money paid by telecom operators. In the June 25 letter and another one dated July 2 to telecom minister Manoj Sinha, Jio said implementing a “dying” technology would potentially cause thousands of crores of rupees in losses because it will inflate capital and operating expenditure by 30%-40%.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-cries-foul-over-tender-rules-of-government-funded-telecom-projects/articleshow/64824859.cms

2018-07-03,"MUMBAI: The telecom tribunal has directed the Department of Telecommunications to release bank guarantees of Rs 2,000 crore to Reliance Communications, granting relief to the Anil Ambani-owned telco, which is trying to sell assets to raise funds and repay lenders.The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal directed DoT on Tuesday to release the bank guarantees that RCom had provided in 2016 to secure the payment of spectrum-related charges. The company had approached the tribunal contesting the demand for bank guarantees for one-time spectrum charges (OTSC).The OTSC dues are towards payment of market-linked prices for excess spectrum held by a telco. Accordingly, DoT had asked RCom to furnish Rs 2,000 crore in bank guarantees towards OTSC in late 2015.It also asked RCom to pay about Rs 6,660 crore in cash to enable its 850 MHz spectrum across 20 circles, which was allotted to the company, to be shared and traded with Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio. The amount was equivalent to the difference between the price paid for the spectrum and the value obtained at the latest auction.RCom made both the payments in 2016 and simultaneously moved the tribunal against DoT, contesting the OTSC demand.Tuesday’s order will reduce the non-funded exposure of banks to the telco by Rs 2,000 crore and speed up the company’s asset sale programme, people familiar with the matter said. RCom is trying to sell spectrum, towers, fibre and switching nodes to Reliance Jio Infocomm and real estate to Canada’s Brookfield in a bid to cut debt of Rs 46,000 crore by about 55%.The operator decided to shut down its wireless services in 2017, burdened with debt in the midst of heavy competition.

2018-07-04,"Mumbai: The continuation of the growth trend in Reliance Retail and clear e-commerce plans would drive a re-rating in shares of Reliance Industries, said Hong Kongheadquartered firm CLSA.Reliance Retail revenues’ more than doubled in FY18 with core retail revenues growing 37 per cent year-onyear in FY18. It reported a 134 per cent growth in revenue in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2017-18.“While we see the US $0.7 bn (billion) in annualised Ebitda in 4Q as a one-off, Reliance’s commentary suggests this could be a new trend and that it will improve further as gains from FY18 Capex of Rs 48 bn flow through. If true, the FY21 Ebitda for core retail may rise to nearly US $1bn and its peer EV/Ebitda-based value to over US$25bn,” said CLSA in a note on Tuesday.CLSA, which has a ‘buy’ rating on shares of Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,230, said a clear ecommerce strategy, perhaps in the upcoming annual general meeting, which may include leveraging Jio’s customer base, could drive a strong re-rating even beyond offline peer valuations. RIL shares ended up 1.1 per cent at Rs 971.6 on Tuesday.CLSA said Reliance’s core retail business leads on growth and compares favourably to peers on unit revenue/Ebitda but it has a lower margin. “Despite a higher share of electronics its pure retail Ebitda margin of 6 per cent is reasonable but below some peers, but this may rise as gains from recent capex (capital expenditure) flow through. It also scores highly on some key unit metrics like per sq-ft revenue and Ebitda,” said CLSA.The firm said the continuation of sector leading growth and a rise in its margin may warrant a premium valuation versus peers.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-growth-e-commerce-plans-to-drive-a-re-rating-in-ril-shares-clsa/articleshow/64849494.cms

2018-07-05,"Reliance Industries on Thursday unveiled a plan to grab a share of the fledgling e-commerce market through what the company called a hybrid platform that aims to bring small retail players on to the online medium.India’s e-commerce market has been growing rapidly, drawing the likes of global biggies like Amazon and Walmart to put in big bets.Indian e-commerce logged a total revenue of $25 billion in 2017, but the same is projected to grow at 20.2 per cent a year to hit $52 billion by 2022.On Thursday, addressing Reliance Industries' 41st annual general meeting (AGM), RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said he sees the biggest growth opportunity for Reliance Retail in creating a hybrid online-offline market.Market leader Flipkart has a standalone e-commerce market share of 31.9 per cent while Amazon India follows closely at 31.1 per cent. The global online retail giant began operations in India about five years after Flipkart's. Citi Research in its May report valued Amazon India’s business at $16 billion.US retail giant Walmart is all set to acquire a 77 per cent stake in Flipkart for $16 billion, pegging the Indian company’s valuation at about $21 billion. Market watchers say the takeover is going to make it a cut-throat race to grab market share.But Ambani has a different plan. He said his new platform would aim to create shared profitability by integrating pharmacies and small grocery stores via Reliance Jio, RIL’s online platform.“The aim is to blend augmented reality and holographic technology to bring an immersive shopping experience,” he added.Reliance Retail, Ambani said, has been growing rapidly and its 7,500 stores witnessed some 350 million footfalls last year.

With mobile penetration expected to reach 54 per cent of the population by 2020, the m-commerce is seen as a high potential area and is expected to account for 70 per cent of e-commerce revenue.Billionaire Ambani seeks to ride this wave through the Jio platform, which has already acquired some 215 million users in less than two years.Ambani also said Jio has enabled RIL to strategically reinvent itself as a technology platform company. “Digital platforms have become new-age factories and service providers,” he said.Ambani also announced plans to launch ultra-high speed fixed line broadband services for homes and enterprises.He said the service will provide ultra high definition entertainment on TV, voice activated assistance, virtual reality gaming and digital shopping as well as smart home solutions.""We will now extend fibre connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fibre-based broadband connectivity solutions,"" India's richest man said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-unveils-unique-hybrid-model-to-grab-a-share-of-e-commerce/articleshow/64866358.cms

Segment EBIT declined by 10.9 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 5,607 crore ($ 860 million), largely on account of reduced crude throughput and adverse move in Brent-Dubai differentials. GRM for 4Q FY18 stood at $11.0/bbl as against $11.5/bbl in 4Q FY17. RIL’s GRM outperformed Singapore complex refining margins by $ 4.0/bbl. He also signalled at less reliance on the energy business for profitability, saying the shares of its consumer-oriented verticals – Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail – in the company’s consolidated EBIDTA has grown from 2 per cent a year ago to 13 per cent last year.Soon, these verticals will be contributing to profitability as much as the core business, he said.Ambani said the RIL-BP JV was seeking new opportunities to market gas in India. The Jamnagar facility is already the world’s largest paraxylene producing unit and the world’s only fully -integrated PET resin manufacturer. Ambani said RIL has also become the largest recycler of PET bottles in the country.The company is proposing a cross-border merger of RHUSA (Reliance Holding USA) with the company and targets 30-35 MMSCMD gas production by 2022.

Unveiling an ambitious vision at the company's 41st annual general meeting today in Mumbai, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Mukesh Ambani and his children Isha, Akash announced several new ventures that will ultimately capture almost every sphere of a consumer's life — from food, clothes and entertainment to health and security. Ambani spoke of a ""golden decade"" in which Reliance would be able to capture huge chunks of India's telecom, retail, entertainment markets. ""As our golden decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of your company as our energy and petrochemical businesses,"" Ambani told shareholders. He spoke of an inflection point for the oil and petrochemical company which is reinventing itself as a technology giant. Ambani's retail and telecom businesses will be intertwined, each supporting the other. ""We see our biggest growth in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform of 35 crore customer footfalls at Reliance Retail, 21.5 crore Jio customers five crore Jio giga-home customers, and three crore small merchants and shop-keepers,"" Ambani said. This means most of things and services you buy will have a Reliance imprint. Through its fast-spreading telecom network, Reliance will leap into shops, and your bedroom. Reliance Retail will connect small kirana shops through the Jio network. Ambani said the new technology would help in integrating physical and digital marketplaces. ""Jio has enabled Reliance to strategically reinvent itself as a technology platform company. Digital platforms have become the new-age factories and service providers,"" he said. Sharing the retail roadmap for the group with shareholders, he said that the company was constantly focusing on improving its retail networks and was trying to redefine it with the help of Jio, which he said would provide connectivity to all small and large-scale merchants in India. Reliance's entry into your bedroom will be through JioGigaFiber, the optical fibre-based broadband service announced by Isha Ambani. ""We will now extend fiber connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity solutions,"" Ambani said.JioGigaFiber will turn your whole home smart. ""Your home will have wall-to-wall Wi-Fi coverage. Every appliance, plug point and switch will become smart. You can have cameras giving you 24x7 security monitoring and alerts,"" Akash Ambani explained. JioGigaFiber means ultra high-definition entertainment on large screen TVs, multi-party video conferencing from your living room, voice-activated virtual assistants and virtual reality gaming, digital shopping and immersive experiences. JioGigaFiber will also facilitate innovative services such as health check-ups through TV calling. And all of this at low prices. The future vision of Reliance means the company will be present in every sphere of a consumer's life.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/reliance-everywhere-how-the-company-will-become-the-very-fiber-of-your-life/articleshow/64867475.cms
2018-07-05,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries’ Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Mukesh Ambani on Thursday unveiled a vision for what he called the Golden Dec ade of the oil-to-telecom giant, and creating ample value for shareholders.The owner of world's largest refining unit at Jamnagar said the conglomerate aims to bring the consumer businesses to a level where it will match revenues of the hydrocarbon business.“The company is making a strategic transition to become a technology platform company and laying a robust foundation to realise the vision,” he said, adding that it made a lot of progress in the past year.The company, according to the RIL chairman, is at an inflection point, and the profit profile is about to change for good.Ambani is ""committed"" to strengthening the company’s balance sheet and realising multiple monetisations. “As earnings from our consumer businesses begin to match those from our hydrocarbon businesses, the next decade will truly become a Golden Decade for Reliance,” he said.“We are focussed on creating multiple platforms that will accelerate growth and create significant societal value for years to come,” the billionaire added.Ambani claimed that Reliance's connectivity platform has already made Jio the largest mobile data network in the world. Through JioGigaFibre, Jio wants to build the home-and-office connectivity platform, which will potentially connect some 50 million homes.“It will be as big as the mobile connectivity platform,” Ambani said in his address to shareholders. He said JioGigaFibre would have a much higher value proposition, as the core investments had been made while building the mobility network.Ambani is also seeking to redefine retailing with what he called a 'New Commerce' platform.Analysts appeared impressed by this vision.The transition road map that Ambani has laid out for the next 10 years clearly defines the earnings trend for the company, said Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager at Angel Broking.""At this point as it stands, Jio and retail contribute 13 per cent of Ebitda. The jump in contribution that these entities are expected to make over the next 8-10 years would be significant. A large element in terms of core capex of $18.5 billion is largely behind the company. The kind of commissioning we have seen in the past with the ethylene project, gas cracker and petcoke gasification, this is all going to incrementally lead to earnings improvement, going forward,” Joshi said.Sushil Choksey of Indus Equity Advisors said the terms 'Golden Decade' and ‘inflection points' are supportive in terms of efforts that the company has put in to boost its core petrochemicals and refining businesses.“The amount of cash being generated out of these two core businesses is going to be used for new technology and new initiative between retail and Jio,” Choksey said. Ambani also announced that the largest-ever cycle of investment in RIL's world-scale petchem complex projects is nearing completion. He expects the investments to yield healthy profits for many years to come.""The value-chain integration would allow us to create an annuity-like cash flow with lower risk of cyclical markets. We have a full plan to further increase the level of integration by adding new chemical chains and capacity to produce new materials and composites of high value. This will minimise the impact of renewables and electricity on transportation fuels. We have the unique advantage, among global players, of being able to pursue this strategy with physical integration at one large site,"" he said.Probal Sen of IDFC Securities is of the view that if RIL’s ambitions actually extend beyond just a traditional broadband service or a traditional telecom service, then the capex could still actually surprise on the upside.“They have repeatedly surprised us with the breadth of their ambition. One will have to wait and watch. But prima facie, capex should definitely be lower and earnings should definitely be on a higher trajectory over the next three years, particularly from the consumer- facing businesses,"" he said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/heres-ambanis-roadmap-to-usher-in-golden-decade-of-value-creation-at-reliance-industries/articleshow/64868060.cms
2018-07-05,"In the medium to long term, Reliance Jio will have to raise the blended ARPU to make money in this market, Nitin Soni, Director, Asian corporates, Fitch Ratings, tells ET Now, after the Reliance AGM.Edited excerpts: What do you make what Mr Ambani has outlined about new customer additions? Is he being very optimistic because Reliance Jio is sort of a big hole. How real are the subscription numbers both in terms of the freebie users and the new subscribers?One of the big takeaways is that the customer base has grown really well. There is a remarkable growth to 215 million subscribers in such a short period of time. So there is no doubt that the data traffic is one of the highest on Reliance Jio’s network compared to incumbents. There are still about 70 to 80 million subscribers who were with the weaker telecos and many of them will be coming to Jio or the incumbents’ network. So, there is a bit of a low hanging fruit for Jio to further grow subscriber base. The important point to note is the revenue market share. As the revenue market share is also rising and Voda, Idea are merging their operations, they will naturally lose some market share. Jio, in our opinion, will keep on gaining both subscriber and revenue market share. A good take away from the whole AGM is that there is no further disruption on the mobile tariffs, there is no new plan which is incrementally negative for the mobile sector. The Jio phone 2 at a lower price point of Rs 3000 will help them to get the continued subscriber growth and data traffic. But it is not incrementally negative for incumbents. Thirdly the Jio fibre launch is a significant announcement and they are going to launch JioGigaFibre in 1,100 cities. That will affect Bharti’s home segment. Bharti’s home segment has been growing well with the high revenue and EBITDA in last 12 months and 24 months. When Jio launches, that will affect Bharti’s revenue and EBITDA in that segment.What will be your view as far as telecom is concerned? We have asked you this question time and again. Do you believe that tariff wars or tariffs from here on should be more rational for the industry? Should the worst in terms of the margins that the industry is seeing now start to bottom out?We have been continuously saying for the last four to five months now that we believe that the blended ARPU has bottomed out. We do not think that incrementally it will go down. If you look at the noise in the market now and Jio’s plans are not incrementally negative for the sector. Given the fact that they have invested Rs 250,000 crore, they need to monetise these investments. I have a simple calculation. If you have a 1.3 billion population paying $2 a month, $24 a year, you come to an industry size of about $27-28 billion and 30% margin. You have $6 to $7 billion kind of an EBITDA. At $40 billion investment, what return on investment are you making in this industry? This is not sustainable. This blended ARPU of below $2 is not sustainable in this sector. If you want to make a high single-digit kind of ROI, you will have to have higher blended ARPU. Look at Bharti, Vodafone and Idea. Their ROI is in low single digit, Idea would be negative. This is an unsustainable situation. In the short term, we understand Jio has to a get larger subscriber base because you cannot make money unless you have a larger subscriber base and they have been successful in getting now 215 million subscribers. But in the medium to long term, they will have to raise the blended ARPU to make money in this market.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/no-further-disruption-on-mobile-tariffs-is-a-good-takeaway-from-reliance-agm-nitin-soni-fitch-ratings/articleshow/64870236.cms

At the time of writing this report, the rupee was trading down by 23 paise.Crude oil prices, however, eased after the US President Donald Trump asked Opec to cut prices. “Market traded in a narrow range while the selling pressure in IT and metal stocks capped the upside. Any signs of stability in bond yields and oil price may provide some turnaround in the domestic sentiment. On the other hand, mid and small cap continued to underperform as investors are switching to large caps to minimize the risk. Global market stays in a positive terrain but Asian market witnessed consolidation due to trade restrictions and weakening currency,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.The BSE Sensex fell for 71 points, or 0.20 per cent, stopping at 35,575, with 15 stocks in the green and 16 in the red.Infosys, Reliance Industries, Sun Pharma, Vedanta and Tata Steel stood as the top drags on the Sensex index.However, ITC, HDFC Bank, YES Bank and Maruti Suzuki emerged among the top gainers in the Sensex kitty of stocks.YES Bank jumped almost 4 per cent on Thursday after the Sebi gave its approval to the firm to start mutual fund business.

2018-07-05,"Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP Markets and Corporate Affairs, India Infoline, says as the AGM pointed out, the future of Reliance could be in digital and ecommerce. Edited excerpts: Mukesh Ambani at the Reliance AGM almost seemed like Tim Cook was making a presentation for his digital plans?Yes, all that was built in and people were again hoping for something like a big bonus announcement which was not going to come. The stock has seen a relative selloff but it has told you all about what the future is and given the extent of broadband and the type of outlook they have. The reality is that FANGs is here to stay whether you like it or not. The market cap of those five stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) is $3.7 trillion. If you think that Reliance is going to look towards the next five years, then digital and ecommerce has to be the way forward. However, as I said the stock might have just peaked out in the morning and then there was status quo, the broader market is looking extremely good. The Nifty and Bank Nifty is outperforming all indices. I am extremely positive on the next 60-90 days and I think the indices and the broader markets are going to do extremely well.How come markets are not recognising that a company which has cash, data, bandwidth and which is creating an ecosystem, needs to be rerated differently?Yes, that is a very good summary you have done but let us face it, the stock has doubled in a year and to expect it to just chug along will not be so easy. I am extremely bullish and like I have already said, this will be the next $100 billion company and go higher. Let it plateau for the next few days but if the Nifty is going to go to 10,900 and beyond, then Reliance at Rs 1030-1050 is definitely on the cards. Look for any decline to accumulate the stock with a slightly longer term view.NBCC has been one of your top recommendations. I understand you are optimistic but what exactly is going wrong over here and why is the stock correcting?A simple fact. There is a stay order of the government. The High Court has sought more time from the NGT for the trees which are being cut in Nauroji Nagar. It is a Delhi specific colony and there four projects worth Rs 40,000 crore are coming up over the next five years. The company has already guided that it is a PMC Project Management Consultant, the Government of India owns the land and they are going to replant that. There are a little bit of debate going on there. The management has already guided that they would be in the process of replanting those trees. However, they have started to worry but ut is a Rs 40,000 crore project in the Delhi NCR with the margin of 10% which will be monetised over the next five years. You cannot but go wrong there. 18th or 19th is the next hearing day. There is a definite cause of alarm. This panic has come in because of some of the media build up and so on. They are replanting those trees and that is what has upset the applecart. I can continue to say that this is a Rs 150 stock and if you have the wherewithal to go through the rhetoric. then please buy it because it is a doubler from here.What is the concern with Infy? What explains this kind of a fall in the stock? Is there concern around what the earnings may be like?It is a good indicator that the market is looking to get into riskier bets –the sectors which have underperformed. Look at cement. I have been on your show and advising everyone to ignore the negatives. Cement is going to be the dark horse sector for the next six months. People are getting out of technology. They think the rupee has hit what it had to, bond yields are now moderating and the risk on trade is more on the broader market where cement, auto, consumption and a whole host of private banks are looking extremely good. It is now routine profit booking. Infosys has had its day in the sun. It has made a top and they will be only selling on rallies. The stock has been a relative outperformer but now the market wants to look at the broader market and hence technology may be at the receiving end at least for the next fortnight or a month.ITC is picking up. A part of it could of course have to do with the agri business and the boost it gets because of a hiked MSP. Do you think the market is now capturing the upside?The problem was that ITC even though blue chip was lagging the market for a long time but you have to have conviction to be in these stocks. This is the largest cash earner business which is there in the last 30 years that I have tracked.Now ITC is no longer dependent on cigarettes. The management is creating the biggest franchise on the hotel side, the paper side and the new product launches on the FMCG side. The icing on the cake is the MSP hike which will now see rural incomes rarely catapulting and the beneficiaries would be names like ITC, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp etc. Also on the back that, the number from Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto are extremely strong. Cnsumption is a no brainer. Whether you buy ITC at Rs 270 or not, it is a Rs 320 stock for me in the next three to six months.What is perspective on oil and marketing companies? They are holding out in today’s market session but the story on oil is not over and done with as yet. We are still sitting on $78 to a barrel on crude oil prices. In oil, the best has already played out. I do not see it breaching $80 in a meaningful way. A meaningful way means that you could have a spike but the underlying theme of oil at these prices is not sustainable. On the back of that, if you heard the petroleum minister and his counterpart in China, they have indicated very clearly that they want a stable regime with lower prices. Otherwise, non-OPEC countries and the alternate energy is going to keep gathering steam.So, the short-term aberration may actually be the pain point which you have seen on the OMCs. However, the government has been very prudent. They have not passed on anything on the excise or any losses. It has been a very marginal tick which you have seen after a huge upside. So, I am relatively bullish. If I am looking at the next three to four months I would expect oil prices to stabilise between that $65 to $72 and if that happens then OMCs will be in a sweet spot. Plus, the risk reward after a steep correction seems to be in their favour. That also summarises my overall market view which means that for the next 60 days, the midcaps or the broader market is going to outperform. We have seen enough of pain and if large caps are going to stabilise around 10,800-11,200, then the midcaps are going to really steal the show and that would include some of the OMCs and other energy plays.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/accumulate-reliance-on-every-dip-with-a-long-term-view-sanjiv-bhasin-india-infoline/articleshow/64871053.cms
2018-07-05,"Shloka Mehta, the to-be daughter-in-law of richest Indian Mukesh Ambani, today made a debut at the annual shareholder meeting of Reliance Industries, one of the most keenly watched affairs in corporate India.  Mehta, 27, who just last week got engaged to Ambani's elder son Akash at a star-studded party, sat in the front row between her fiancee's younger brother Anant and his grandmother Kokilaben Ambani.  She watched as Akash and his twin sister Isha demonstrated the company's latest offering, high-speed fiber broadband, and second-generation JioPhone.  Ambani arrived for the 41st Annual General Meeting (AGM) with his wife Nita and Anant. Akash and Isha followed in a separate car. The Ambani family owns 47.48 per cent of the country's largest corporate entity.  The AGM, however, was a restrained or transactional affair, with product launches, demos and future outlook being presented by Ambani, the chairman and managing director.  Compared to the last AGM, where shrill cries on Jio, the company's newly launched mobile offering continued throughout, the entire affair was very subdued today, even when Ambani scions Akash and Isha presented new products and features on Jio. Shloka made an exit with Isha midway when the shareholder questions were still on. The questions never ended and had to be cut short due to time constraints.  Akash and Shloka are to get married in December, the same month when Isha is to wed Anand Piramal. Anand, son of Ajay Piramal and Swati Piramal, was not present at the AGM.  Shloka is the youngest daughter of diamond magnate Russell Mehta, who heads rosy Blue Diamonds. This was her first outing with the Ambani family after last week's pre-engagement and engagement parties that were attended by top celebrities including film stars, sportspersons, and politicians.  At the AGM, many shareholders raised concerns on the low dividend payout and devised creative strategies, including the need to distribute 'sweets' on happy occasions, hinting at the impending weddings of Akash and Isha. In his short reply, the dividend payout concerns were the only topic which got touched by Ambani.  He said the company understands the need to increase the shareholder returns and satisfaction and assured that it will be looked into as a priority. Other questions included whether the company will list the retail and telecom ventures, and concerns on the payments bank rollout, spectrum purchase from Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications, and impact of movements in dollar and crude prices.  Mukesh Ambani assured he has noted down all the questions, concerns and suggestions, and will individually address those to the shareholders. Explicit mentions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his flagship schemes like Digital India were also missing in the AGM speech, which comes months ahead of general elections. At the last AGM, Ambani had made multiple mentions to Modi's Digital India vision, seeking to underline how it resonates with RIL's vision. There were announcements on healthcare which is in line with the Ayushman Bharat initiative, connectivity (Digital India) and connected homes (Smart Cities Mission), where an alignment with the government schemes was possible.  The Reliance Industries scrip closed 2.53 per cent down at Rs 965 a piece on BSE, as opposed to a 0.20 per cent correction on the benchmark.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/ambani-bahu-shloka-mehta-makes-debut-at-ril-agm/articleshow/64871427.cms

2018-07-07,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm is likely to go in for a phased launch of its fibre-based home broadband services, starting early November, from 15-20 key cities with high data demand, said people aware of the matter. The Mukesh Ambani-owned telecom operator is widely expected to unveil a spate of disruptive price plans in the Rs 500-700 per month range, offering a whopping 100 GB of data at starting speeds of 100 Mbps bundled with value-added services such as internet TV and video-calling, according to analysts. Jio may even offer services for free for the initial 3-6 months, said a few analysts, mirroring its earlier wireless services pricing strategy for attracting home broadband customers who tend to be stickier than mobile phone users. Other challenges for the telco, they said, could be the painstaking and costly process of creating physical infrastructure afresh on the ground in the fibrebased home broadband business, besides getting clearances from residents’ associations for extending home broadband last-mile connectivity to buildings. Reliance Industries (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani on Thursday unveiled Jio’s high-speed home broadband services plans under the GigaFiber brand banner, to be rolled out across 1,100 cities, targeting 50 million homes. However, he did not specify a time frame for launch or the pricing. “Jio will choose the initial cities for launch based on early demand levels for its home broadband services after the registration process kicks off from August 15, especially since there will be costs involved in extending lastmile connectivity,” said a senior industry executive, who did not wish to be identified. Global brokerage Morgan Stanley said Jio would prioritise its home broadband services rollout to the localities which have the highest number of registrations. Brokerage JP Morgan said it expected Jio’s home broadband services “launch pricing to be at a large discount to current broadband and set-top box prices,” in line with its aggressive customer acquisition strategy. Bharti Airtel currently offers 50 GB of data a month at speeds of 40 Mbps in Bengaluru for Rs 799 per month, whereas in Delhi a Rs 499 per month pack offers 100 GB a month at a much slower speeds of 8 Mbps. Rajiv Sharma, telecom analyst at HSBC, said he expected Bharti Airtel to “face near-term earnings pressure if Jio comes up with disruptive home broadband plans offering 100 GBs (of high-speed data) priced below Rs 700 per month”. ET’s queries to Reliance Jio Infocomm did not elicit any response till late evening on Friday. Airtel is said to have already made a counter move, removing the FUP (fair usage policy) data limit on its home broadband packs in Hyderabad and turned them into unlimited data plans. A person familiar with the matter said that the telco could replicate the exercise in other key markets in the coming weeks. Bharti Airtel did not reply to ET's queries on the matter.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-may-opt-for-phased-launch-of-fibre-based-home-broadband/articleshow/64892083.cms
2018-07-07,"Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved giving Mukesh Ambani another five years as the Chairman and Managing Director of the company. Ambani, 61, has been on the board of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) since 1977 and was elevated as Chairman of the company after the death of his father and group patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani in July 2002. The company put a resolution to re-appoint Ambani ""for a period of five years, on expiry of his present term of office, i e with effect from April 19, 2019"" at the 41st Annual General Meeting held on July 5 in Mumbai. As many as 50,818 crore shares out of a total share base of 616.45 crore voted on the resolution, RIL said in a regulatory filing. Of the votes polled, 98.5 per cent were in favour of the resolution while 1.48 voted against it. According to the resolution, Ambani will be paid an annual salary of Rs 4.17 crore and Rs 59 lakh of perquisites and allowances. Retirement benefits are not included in the overall ceiling of remuneration. He will also be entitled to receive bonus based on net profits and ""expenses incurred for travelling, boarding and lodging, including for spouse and attendant(s) during business trips and provision of car(s) for use on company's business and communication expenses at residence shall be reimbursed at actuals and not considered as perquisites,"" it said.

2018-07-07,"Mysore Colony lies in a part of Mumbai that is distinct from the city that most people see. This is the industrial quarters of the city, in the east. There are no skyscrapers here. Tall grey chimneys billow smoke.There are imposing storage tanks for oil and gas. There’s greenery, a few treelined avenues and a couple of sports clubs. This disparate agglomeration stands under the benign shadow, figuratively speaking, of two large refineries in the area, owned by the state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL).This is in the Mumbai suburb of Trombay that was once a separate island, but today is well connected to the rest of the city via the Eastern Freeway. There is also India’s first mono-rail track passing by overhead on its raised pillars. While the freeway works like a charm, the monorail ceased operations last November after a fire incident. Not too many complained. There hadn’t been too many takers for its services anyway. However, below the elevated monorail station at Mysore Colony, deep underground, lies a piece of infrastructure that is highly sought after. This is the ground zero of a fascinating and unfolding battle between the two large state-run petroleum companies on the one side and the behemoth Reliance Industries Ltd on the other. The matter of contention: twin pipelines that carry aviation turbine fuel (ATF) from these refineries to about 12 km to the northwest, to the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at Santacruz. It’s one of Asia’s busiest airports; 47 million passengers used the airport in 2017. It’s also where a fifth of India’s ATF sales take place.Sale of ATF is a highly regulated and lucrative business, with oil companies typically enjoying a 16-21% profit margin. Reliance Industries, India’s largest conglomerate by market cap, is also the producer of a fourth of India’s ATF. It wants in on the trade in Mumbai airport, worth almost Rs 10,000 crore.A kilometer from the refineries in Trombay is the Pirpau jetty operated by the Mumbai Port Trust. RIL wants to ship ATF from its Jamnagar refinery to the jetty and then use the pipelines to get the fuel to the airport. HPCL and BPCL, the public sector oil companies that own the pipelines, are in no mood to relent. The swirling friction is now pulling in industry lobbies, regulators and other stakeholders into its vortex. The first round has gone to Reliance already. Sector regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has said in a notice on May 4, 2018, the two pipelines (BPCL’s is 15 km long and HPCL’s 19 km) should be “common carriers”. It has sought public opinion on the subject.Reliance had approached the PNGRB about the pipelines in November 2016. Reliance has been in touch with the firm managing the airport fuel storage facility since 2014, seeking access to the airport for selling its ATF. In August 2016, Reliance had written to BPCL requesting a meeting to discuss access to its pipeline to bring ATF to the airport. It has also made its case before the PNGRB after the public notice was issued.Why does RIL need these pipelines so bad? Very simply, it’s the most cost-effective way of getting its fuel into the airport. Mumbai’s notorious traffic rules out transporting it in tanker trucks. Laying a fresh pipeline is onerous. It is almost impossible to get right-of-way to finish the work. Public infrastructure showpieces such as the Monorail project are still incomplete for this reason.The Mumbai Airport accounts for 18.9% of the 7.4 mt Indian ATF fuel market and Reliance can crack a big market if it gets access to the airport. It currently has only a 4.2% share of the domestic market and exports most of its ATF. At the heart of the tussle is a reorganisation of the fuel arrangements at the airport. The old storage tanks at the airport were built by HPCL, BPCL and IOC. These assets have now been brought under a new company called Mumbai Aviation Fuel Farms Facility Private Ltd (MAFFFL), with the three PSUs and Mumbai International Airport Ltd as the shareholders. MAFFFL will operate an integrated and “open access” fuel farm that will allow any vendor to sell their ATF at the airport, according to commitments these companies made to the Competition Commission of India in 2014. Reliance is pegging its hopes on the open access mode for the use of ATF infrastructure that Mumbai Airport is about to adopt. But does open access also include the pipeline that gets the fuel in? That is the question before the regulator. A senior Reliance Industries official, who spoke to ET Magazine on the condition of anonymity, said that the company plans to bring in its ATF from Jamnagar in Gujarat through ships up to the Pirpau Jetty and build a short pipeline to feed into the two existing pipelines. Another option for the company, the official said, would be to enter into exchange arrangements with the PSU oil companies and become a reseller for their ATF at the Mumbai airport, while offering its products in return in locations closer to its refinery and storage facilities. Such exchange arrangements are common as ATF sales have to meet strict standards. Indian Oil Corporation, with a 59% market share of ATF in Mumbai, actually sells HPCL’s and BPCL’s ATF in Mumbai, and offers them its own ATF in the Northeast. Reliance has a similar arrangement with Shell at Bengaluru.Shadow Boxing Getting the pipelines declared as common carrier could well be a bargaining chip in this tussle. Amber Dubey, KPMG’s partner and head of aerospace & defence, says: “Open access in use of ATF infrastructure is beneficial to the industry as it leads to competition among suppliers and lower cost to airlines. ATF, after all, is the single largest component of airline costs.” Reliance officials argue its entry into any airport has seen the prices drop. Typically, a nominal price for ATF is declared for every airport, but actual supply happens at negotiated discounts on contracts vendors ink with airlines. In 2010, Reliance had complained to the Competition Commission of India about an Air India tender for ATF. It alleged that the PSUs were operating as a cartel, offering discounts in airports where Reliance was present. At other airports all the PSUs put in similarly priced, typically higher, bids. Subodh Dakwale, executive director of Indian Oil Corporation, declined to comment, saying his company did not own the pipelines and the barter arrangement has been in place for decades. Spokespersons for HPCL and BPCL declined comment. An RIL spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. However, the two PSUs have responded strongly to PNGRB’s May 4 notice. In a June 1 letter, HPCL’s general manager (aviation) Sandip Brahme questioned the basis of the PNGRB notice and argued that power vested with the board to declare a pipeline a “common carrier” relates only to the city gas and natural gas pipelines. Brahme further argued that the PNGRB formed its opinion in favour of declaring the pipeline as a common carrier without hearing out HPCL first. In a June 1 letter, BPCL’s chief general manager for pipelines, L R Jain, says there is no excess capacity in the pipelines as the one set up by HPCL in 19961999 is old and its capacity to carry ATF has been constrained. The BPCL pipeline terminates at the Santacruz side of the airport and from that point the ATF is carried to Sahar terminal via the HPCL pipeline. Both PSUs have insisted the pipelines are designed to evacuate products from the refineries and any use by a third party would disturb the process at the refineries, leading to a production slowdown. So far, industry lobbies Ficci, Assocham, CII and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have written to the PNGRB, arguing the pipelines should be declared as common carriers. Jet Airways and Emirates have also supported this stance, as has the Airports Authority of India. The IATA’s head of commercial fuel services, Melvyn Tan, wrote that the absence of “open access” at Indian airports led to higher ATF prices in top Indian airports when compared to global peers. Dubey of KPMG adds: “Open access to ATF infrastructure will also facilitate direct import of ATF by the airlines. Direct import was allowed several years back by the government, but has not really taken off, with last mile access to aircraft being one of the key stumbling blocks."" In fact, Jet Airways has in their letter to PNGRB has said it would also like to import ATF and transfer it to Mumbai Airport through the same pipelines. Direct imports under the open general license allow airlines to avoid the state VAT. It is quite apparent that the PSUs are not in the mood to allow a toe-hold to Reliance in Mumbai airport. Reliance has been viably able to take its ATF to only 10 airports in India. It has emerged as the top supplier in half of these and has grabbed 100% of the market in Jabalpur. The company says it has better service offerings. Which may well be true. But it underscores the company’s marketing muscle, and illustrates why the oil PSUs will be wary of letting the giant into the Mumbai airport.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/battle-over-lucrative-aviation-fuel-pipeline-heats-up-between-reliance-industries-oil-psus/articleshow/64899687.cms

2018-07-09,"We will wait for two more quarters before considering PSB shares, Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:Still time to buy into the stock because this seems like a long-haul project just going by the takeaways from the Reliance AGM recently?It was quite a remarkable move but it is not a very expensive stock. But having said that, they have about Rs 1000 odd crore of debt. Longer term, the developments are going to be very exciting especially integrating media with the technology of delivering that media to customers through fibre to the home or direct delivery. Some of their other mainstream businesses which are online right now which have been providing the cash flow so far are probably going to see a little bit of a muted quarter. The impact of the sanctions on Iranian oil will affect the refining margins going forward. So, it is a mixed bag. If you are playing for a much longer term -- 10 years or so -- Reliance would make a lot of sense. I do not expect fireworks in results in the short term.What about the IT majors and how do you see their earnings unfold starting off with TCS?TCS will be interesting. The problem really is about how much has the dollar depreciation helped them. They do tend to hedge at least a quarter out. I do not think the results are going to be dramatically higher in this quarter though overall they have been impacted right now by the buyback. The buyback will improve their EPS. The buyback will also cause a lot of retail investors to jump in on the stock because of a much higher acceptance ratio for retail last time around. I am waiting to see how the results pan out. Anything above 12% according to me will be fantastic. But let us wait till tomorrow.Sticking with IT, last time you were saying that there is not much of difference between the valuations of midcap and largecap IT space. So, why dwell on midcap IT when largecap IT is a good buy. What explains this exuberance in midcap IT space today? Hexaware is up by 7%, Tata Elxsi is going as if there is no tomorrow. KPIT Technologies is also doing really well. What explains this move?From this individual stock basis, as a disclosure, we own some of these players and so we are biased in that perspective. Where we are right now is a period of about three years of underperformance and both fundamentally and from a pricing perspective for midcap IT. The US economy has been moving really well in the last say one year or so and spending is starting to come back. It is not yet there but it is time to come back and you are seeing a lot of onroad activity within the US at least. The US markets are going up but they are nowhere close to being overvalued as ours are in comparison with our economic prospects. A bit of this translates into midcap IT winning more orders, getting more business and perhaps getting more top line growth. We will have to see that plays out, it has last quarter I hope it does this quarter and I think they get impacted even more than the larger cap IT player. So that is one of the reasons I am positive about them. I cannot say about today because obviously none of this happened on the weekend. The Income Tax Department selling shares may sound ironical or funny but that is one of the reason why Vedanta has been underperforming. Now that we know that there is a large supplier in the market and Income Tax Department will have to sell another 3% soon, do you think Vedanta could be a stock where you should be creating short positions?It is a good thing that the I-T department is doing whatever it is doing. At least somebody is trying to actually sell shares as part of a recovery process versus raising the public sector banks. But at this point, this supply will go away if they are planning to sell in a month or so. Vedanta has actually demonstrated some interesting moves and coupled some announcements abroad about them looking to take parts of the company private. From that perspective, if Vedanta id going to fall a lot, then it would be interesting. I still think it is probably fairly valued or perhaps little bit of overvalued. I do not see a great future for metals in the next one year. So, I am avoiding those as we speak. There are no calls to buy from my side.What do you hope to hear from the PSU banks because a fraction of the market believes that there could be value emerging out there?With the public sector banks, it always seems like they cannot go worse from here and they always surprise us negatively. At some point, this is going to change but I do not know whether that this is the point. At this point, we are going to see one or two more layers of impact. There are two more NCLTs to go, there is bunch of resolution already in play and perhaps will require to be provisioned further. If we have any fresh slippages, that will come in this quarter. It is probably closer to the end than the beginning when I will wait for asset quality issues to start showing an improvement and may be a couple of quarters before I buy PSU bank stocks. There are strong public sector banks in general and some of them I cannot name because we have of compliance issues, but we do feel that some value that is being built in some of these public sector banks. You should be picky and choose the right players. I do not think SBI is the right one but there are number of smaller Rs 2 lakh-crore balance sheet type banks which are actually not in any of those RBI restrictions but performing well. I would advise viewers to take a look and pick the right ones.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-is-a-good-long-term-bet-dont-expect-fireworks-in-short-term-deepak-shenoy-capital-mind/articleshow/64918579.cms
2018-07-09,"MUMBAI: Reliance Jio's recently announced broadband offering will impact multiple system operators (MSOs) and direct to home (DTH) players, but will benefit content providers, a report said today.""Jiogigafiber, a fibre-based broadband service for homes and businesses, by Reliance Industries has the potential to disrupt the retail broadband segment and open up new digital avenues for the enterprise broadband segment,"" India Ratings said in a report.It said the level of impact on the MSOs and DTH players will depend on their geographical diversity with regard to subscribers, the relative attractiveness of the market, and current tariffs and service offerings.The impact will be visible only in fiscal year 2019-2020 even though the service rollout is slated to happen from August 15 this year. Aggressive posturing by Jio for market penetration will be ""credit negative"" for existing players, it said.RIL announced Jiogigafibre, the broadband offering, at its shareholder meeting last week but details such as the pricing are not yet revealed. The company plans to initially launch the offering in 1,100 cities.It can be noted that the deep-pocketed Jio's entry has wrecked the telecom sector, resulting in mergers, bankruptcy filings, market withdrawals and profits plummeting for entrenched players. Jio made voice, which contributed over 70 per cent of revenues, free, and started off by offering services for free and then announced aggressive plans.The agency said penetration levels are low in India as compared to other countries globally, with only 7 per cent of the 290 million households having fixed broadband and 180 million TV households. It said Jio's target of 50 million households is only 18 per cent of the households, and ""achievable"".At the current monthly broadband tariff of Rs 500-600 per household, the potential market size for 50 million households could be Rs 30,000-36,000 crore, significant portion of which could be tapped by Jio, it said.The last mile connectivity will be a challenge for the country's largest corporate as it rolls out the fibre-based broadband offering, it said welcoming the phased rollout strategy which Jio is planning.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jios-broadband-service-to-impact-msos-dth-players-report/articleshow/64920554.cms
2018-07-10,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries has identified last-mile delivery as the biggest challenge for its planned online marketplace venture and will focus on nurturing this aspect of the business, where rivals Flipkart and Amazon have asignificant head-start, sources said.“Last-mile delivery and the overall customer experience are going to be priority areas for Reliance,” a source said, asking not to be identified. Reliance plans to invest heavily to build a robust supply chain, including its own delivery logistics, and will also use third-party companies as “it wants to take ownership of delivery and experience,” the source said.The key focus for the oil-to-retail conglomerate will be on speed and the ability to deliver the right products with minimum errors, the source said.Reliance did not immediately respond to queries seeking comment on its last-mile delivery plans.The online marketplace will host all of Reliance Retail’s businesses, including grocery, fashion, jewellery and electronics, apart from independent sellers.Reliance has plans for large hiring – directly and indirectly – for its ecommerce entry, the person said.When Reliance unveiled its plan of make use of its telecom service – Reliance Jio Infocomm – and the Reliance Retail chain for a “hybrid online-to-offline” venture on Thursday, chairman Mukesh Ambani said the company would leverage legions of kirana stores as last-mile delivery partners.ET reported last week that Reliance is working on a multi-channel platform where goods and services can be offered and purchased from anywhere through online and offline routes. While products will be delivered to their doorsteps, customers would also have the option of picking up their purchases from Reliance’s network of stores or the outlets of its last-mile delivery partners.Entities such as Amazon and Myntra are using an increasing number of small retailers as their last-mile delivery mechanism.A retail analyst with a foreign consulting firm said Reliance is a deep-pocketed, long-term player prepared to lose money in the initial stages and to invest heavily in supply chain development.“It is going to be tough but they have two parts already covered really well. They got solid physical retail business where they have got suppliers, whether it is fashion or food and grocery,” he said.“Similarly on the Jio side, they can push apps.

The stock hit a life high of Rs 1,090 on the BSE, making the market valuation hit that magic mark. However, at 11:55 am, it stood at Rs 1,085.25, with the m-cap figure dropping slightly to $99.92 billion.The oil and gas-to-telecom behemoth had first crossed the $100-billion market-cap mark in October 2007 when the rupee was at 39.5 against the dollar. In rupee terms, the company’s market capitalisation then read Rs 4.11 lakh crore. Brokerage Jefferies has maintained 'underperform' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 790. It says refining headwinds may offset another smart petrochemical performance in Q1. Retail may boost consolidated earnings enough to leave it 1 per cent higher QoQ at Rs 95.7 billion. ""We keep our Underperform noting that refining/petchem margins have weakened,"" it says.Recently, Credit Suisse intiated coverage on RIL with target price of Rs 1,180 per share. It sees significant potential in consumer businesses. It said Jio has the potential to create significant value. ""Petcoke gasification should help growth in refining,"" the brokerage says.

2018-07-12,"Reliance Industries, India’s largest company by net profit, may see an upward revision of its core refining business because of new ship-fuel emission norms and full utilisation of the pet-coke gasification project, which should together expand the gross refining margins (GRM).Reliance’s GRM — the difference between crude oil costs and average selling price of refining products — could expand in the range $2-8 per barrel in the next two years. An expanding GRM suggests higher operating profits for the refining business, fetching superior EV/EBITDA multiple for the segment.At present, the Street has assigned a multiple of around 6.5-7.5 for the refining business, which accounted for half of the total operating profit (EBIT) of the company in the past fiscal year and 40-45 per cent of the fair value computed by analysts.The major trigger for GRM expansion could be better realisation on diesel, kerosene, and ATF — middle distillate in technical parlance — after the implementation of new fuel norms for ships by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). New rules effective from 2020 say ships will be propelled by fuel that will have sulphur content less than 0.5 per cent against the current limit of 3.5 per cent .To use lower sulphur fuel, ships could start using blended diesel, and this could lift crack spread (or the effective realisation per barrel) from middle distillates. According to a note by Macquarie, middle distillate cracks could expand from $15 per barrel to $30 due to substantial demand pull from the shipping industry. As a result, the brokerage has raised its GRM assumption for RIL to $20 per barrel for FY21 from $12 previously.RIL is likely to be the major beneficiary of higher realisation for middle distillates. Every refinery typically has a configuration that decides how much will the output of petroleum product be for every unit of crude oil throughput. The complex refinery produces more of higher priced products.The Street believes that middle distillates of RIL constitute nearly 45 per cent of refinery output. Therefore, higher profitability from middle distillates could boost GRM by $4-6 per barrel. The effort to reduce sulphur in fuel is likely to expand the differential between higher sulphur crude and Brent. Given that RIL’s refinery could process several grades of high-sulphur and high-viscous crude, this advantage will further expand the GRM.In the near term, pet-coke gasification is likely to improve GRM by $1.5-2.5 per barrel. Under the pet-coke gasification project, internally produced low-cost petcoke will be used in power generation, and it will replace imported LNG. The four gasifiers of phase one are likely to touch full utilisation by the second quarter of the current fiscal, while the remaining six gasifiers will be commissioned over the next three to six months.Macquarie has raised RIL stock price target to Rs 1,240 because of the benefits the new emission norms for ships will provide to India’s biggest private company.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/new-emission-norms-higher-utilisation-to-boost-reliance-grm/articleshow/64956941.cms

2018-07-15,"The battle over lucrative pipelines supplying jet fuel to Mumbai airport is hotting up with a powerful formation of Reliance Industries and private airlines Jet Airways and Emirates trying to break the stranglehold of PSU oil firms BPCL and HPCL. BPCL and HPCL built and operate two separate pipelines from their Mahul refineries in Mumbai to supply jet fuel (ATF) to airlines at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at Santacruz in the city.Reliance, which produces a fourth of India's aviation turbine fuel (ATF), wants access to these pipelines to be able to get a pie of Rs 10,000 crore fuel trade that happens at one of Asia's busiest airports. While Reliance and airlines feel competition among fuel suppliers would bring down costs, HPCL and BPCL said the pipelines are their ""captive"" infrastructure to take products out of the refineries and giving third party access to them would hurt their operations and profits. Sector regulator the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) on May 4 supported the Reliance idea and sought industry comments on declaring pipelines as a common carrier and giving third parties access. If implemented, it would also an airline to import fuel and use the infrastructure at the refineries situated on the coast to transport it to the airport. A company like Reliance can ship the fuel from its refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to Mumbai and use pipelines to take it into the airport. In its comments, Reliance said the present ATF demand at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport is 1.4 million tonnes per annum and it is ""absolutely essential"" that access to the BPCL and HPCL ATF pipelines is available to other jet fuel marketing oil companies to service this demand. ""Non-availability of access to the pipeline would deny to the ultimate consumers the benefit of competition,"" it wrote to PNGRB last month. Stating that at least two-thirds of the capacity in the twin pipeline is spare, it said alternative of laying the third pipeline will create environment and safety hazard besides resulting in infructuous investments. Bringing ATF by road tankers is also not an option as 400 road tankers would be required to ply on the already clogged Mumbai roads, it said. Reliance wanted PNGRB to declare the twin pipelines as a common carrier and give access to other entities on a non-discriminatory basis. Also, it wanted ""hook-up"" facility within BPCL and HPCL refinery complexes to be able to feed ATF into the pipelines. Supporting the idea, the UAE-based Emirates in its comments said making the pipelines common carrier would give airlines ""more options to select ATF suppliers"". Also, entry of more ATF suppliers will bring ""true competition among fuel suppliers at Mumbai airport"" which will be beneficial to the Indian aviation sector and airline passengers. ""It would also encourage airlines to uplift more fuel volumes in Mumbai,"" it said. Echoing the view, Jet Airways said the move would give it ""more options to select ATF suppliers of its choice, based on competitive pricing."" ""With the declaration of the pipelines as an open access, airlines will be able to import their ATF to meet their requirement and utilise the pipeline infrastructure to transport the ATF to the airport with ease and at lower cost,"" it said. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) also said the move would ensure cheaper ATF is available to the benefit of passengers and result in optimal utilisation of existing pipeline infrastructure. BPCL and HPCL, on the other hand, said PNGRB did not follow the rules in giving an opportunity to the ""owners"" of the pipeline to give their views before floating the consultation paper. ATF pipeline is outside the scope and purview of PNGRB Act and the regulator does not have the jurisdiction to declare them as a common carrier, they argued. Also, a captive or a dedicated pipeline of a company is outside the scope and ambit of a common carrier and beyond the jurisdiction of the PNGRB, they said. PNGRB hasn't yet given a final view on the issue.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-vs-psus-battle-for-atf-pipelines-in-mumbai-hots-up/articleshow/64995061.cms

As per our understanding, JioPhone devices are all imported from China. The telecom service provider (Jio) is now planning to import large volumes via Indonesia to enjoy 0% customs duty,” Bhupesh Raseen, chairman of mobile advisory committee at TMA, told ET.Raseen added that a move to ship fully assembled devices from China via the country that is part of a block of 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries — with whom India has a free trade pact — would harm the government’s Make in India programme in which local firms have invested hugely.India imposes a 20% basic customs duty on fully-built mobile phones shipped in from other markets, like China.TMA is also planning to meet finance minister Arun Jaitley and top ministry officials to express the pressing concern.Earlier this month, Ambani announced the JioPhone, its basic model of the 4G featurephone, will be sold for Rs 501 in exchange for any featurephone from July 21.He also announced an upgraded JioPhone 2, priced at Rs 2,999, to be available from August 15.

JioPhone is also manufactured locally in India now,” a company spokesperson said.The association said if Jio was permitted to offer a feature phone at a much lower price point, the businesses of mobile vendors like Karbonn, Lava, Jivi Mobiles and nearly 100 other brands will be rendered “uncompetitive and unviable overnight”.It may even force the Indian brands, who rely for a bulk of their revenues on sales of feature phones, to shut down their manufacturing and sales operations completely.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/reliance-jio-says-not-importing-4g-feature-phones/articleshow/65001400.cms

2018-07-17,"Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey, discusses HUL, Zee Entertainment, Dr Reddy’s and OMCs with ET Now.Edited excerpts:  I have a HUL report from CLSA which is a three-year old report and it is headlined that silver is available at the price of gold. At that time, HUL was Rs 1200. Now HUL is at Rs 1700. Even though valuation concerns were there three years ago, that has not stopped fund managers from buying into HUL. Why is nobody paying any heed to basic theory of investing?In this quarter, results has shown around 12% or 12.5% top line growth and the EBITDA, PBT and the bottom line growth is in the vicinity of 20%. If the company is moving smartly on pricing or the margin front, that is one important aspect for this particular business. There is a higher amount of demand in the rural market because of the availability of funds in the hands of the rural masses. As a result, FMCG products will see relatively higher volumes with consumption picking up. But these numbers are not going to be beyond 15%. The key lies in improving the margin and that is what this company is doing. The GST rollout has been by and large very successful for many of these consumer companies. On one side, they have been able to destock their inventories and the working capital benefits. On other hand, the just-in-time inventories into the system has helped them to bring down the costs. Though one cannot say that it has been reflecting completely into the accounts of the current quarter, as we see the GST stabilising, the bigger beneficiaries would be some of the larger FMCG companies. The likes of HUL, ITC will continue to produce better profit performance from the FMCG business. This is likely to continue going ahead. Whether HUL valuations are right I do not know. This is one company which has always been expensive even in the past. This is a story for the people who buy today and await their return to come into their portfolio two years hence. For two years, if you are satisfied with the muted returns, then that you can buy the stock at higher valuations and start earning your return after two years of investments.Do you think that Zee Entertainment will continue to lead the sector when it comes to ad revenue growth? Does it make you bullish on the entire broadcast space?Broadcasting along with internet will be the combination to look out for for as far as the entertainment companies are concerned. because more than TV channels, larger amount of contents are going to be consumed through the internet through different other channels including the mobile phones, ISP channel, the MS or DTH channels. All of these channels would probably start demanding higher amount of contents coming through the internet and as a result of it, distribution reach and consumption could possibly increase.From that perspective, there is a reasonably good possibility for ad revenues to increase because the size of the property itself is increasing. Companies like Zee and Network18 Group have been engaging themselves to create this particular situation for them which ultimately enlarges the ad pie for them. Whether Zee becomes a buy at this point of time, I am not too sure. Valuation is always at a stretched level because of one premier company in the entire space vis-à-vis others. May be a small correction in the market price -- 10-20% at any point of time if -- would be a good opportunity to add the stock to the portfolio.What is your view on OMCs? Between IOC, HPCL and BPCL where would you place your bet?Valuation-wise, we are finding comfort now because they have corrected. But whether allocation of money should go into OMCs per se or to Reliance is a debate. Reliance has given maximum comfort to me and it has been validated in last few years largely because of the size of the company getting doubled from balance sheet point of view. To a greater extent, Reliance may be a relatively better choice from the allocation of money point of view because when you see profits doubling in two-two and a half years time, one gets confidence that the stock will give you 100% return in two years.This doubling of profit is largely due to the Jio platform which is now rolling out to the fiber to home kind of a product. I remain a little bit more confident on Reliance and the reason I am not preferring OMCs is because Reliance has better clarity and visibility to me.After the injunction on Suboxone, DRL got punished in trade yesterday. The weakness on DRL has rubbed off on the rest of the pack too. Do you sense this decline could be bought? May be not Dr Reddy’s but the others?You should not be treating all the companies at the same level. The patent suit which has been filed in case of DRL is definitely not something which it is applying to all other companies, which are India companies. Most of the Indian pharma companies have basically moved from pure generics to the branded generics and now the speciality products. Many companies have already put up the plants for some of the specialty products including DRL. We are likely to see in the second half of the financial year new product launches in USA and they promise to have relatively better turnover and profits thereafter. I do agree that world over the generic pharma companies would face the pressure of margins, but that would not be same as what we have seen three years-four years back. The new product launches relative to growth coming into the books would possibly show relatively better profit performance for the pharma companies. So yes, any correction of major degree which we have started seeing in pharma companies, should be seen as a buying opportunity at lower levels.We think companies like Cipla, Sun Pharma have greater clarity as far as growth is concerned. You can expect FY18-19 would be of lightly average growth but FY19-20 should be reasonably smart growth year.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/why-deven-choksey-prefers-reliance-to-other-omcs/articleshow/65022660.cms

2018-07-18,"On the eve of the monsoon session, the defence ministry has decided to play it safe, postponing a decision on a warship deal that would have given the winner a Rs 20,000-crore contract under the Make in India initiative.The commercial bidding process for four amphibious warships to be made in India has been stuck for over a year now after L&T and Reliance Naval & Engineering Limited (RNEL) were shortlisted by the ministry.In a day of u-turns, top executives of both the companies were summoned to South Block for the opening of commercial bids, which would have decided the winner of the contract. A relatively short notice of a few days was given to the executives to be present for the purpose.L&T officials, including a board member, flew down from Mumbai and senior RNEL representatives landed up at Navy HQ at the summoned time, only to be asked to wait for over an hour. At the end of which they were informed without any explanation that the bid opening has been deferred. “The opening has been deferred for now,” a defence ministry official confirmed to ET, without elaborating on the reasons for summoning and abrupt change of plans. The executives — who were not even addressed by any senior ministry official — refused to comment.It is unclear what changed within a few hours, but the Rs 20,000-crore contract for landing platform docks (LPD) has been in the middle of a brewing corporate war, with allegations of favouritism and supplying insider information making their way to the ministry, as reported by ET.RNEL, which has originally bid for the contract in its earlier avatar as the Pipavav Shipyard, has filed an official complaint alleging a top Navy officer in charge of the selection process has been favouring L&T with confidential information. L&T has been pointing out the financial difficulties and debt restructuring issues that have afflicted RNEL, raising questions on its ability to complete the contract. This has resulted in further stalling of the mega contract.The LPD has the potential to become the largest warship to be built in an Indian private sector shipyard. It is needed to move troops and equipment for an amphibious operation across the sea. Both companies have a foreign collaborator for design and construction — RNEL has joined hands with the French Naval Group and L&T’s partner is Spain’s Navantia Group.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/lt-reliance-officials-first-called-for-bid-opening-then-sent-back-sans-explanation/articleshow/65032400.cms

2018-07-18,"Reliance Industries, India’s second-largest company by market value, plans to raise about 400 billion rupees ($5.8 billion) in fresh debt this financial year as it expands its consumer businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.The billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led company will raise funds through loans and bonds, mostly in the Indian currency, the people said asking not to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Of this, the refining-to-retail conglomerate already has shareholder approval to raise as much as 200 billion rupees through non-convertible debentures.Reliance’s total debt has tripled in the past five years as it borrowed to fuel more than 3.3 trillion rupees of spending on a new telecom venture and its traditional petrochemicals business. Ambani will invest this year to roll out fiber-based broadband services and on acquisitions, including the purchase of telecom assets from brother Anil’s Reliance Communications Ltd. The company has total borrowings of about 2.2 trillion rupees, more than half of which is due to be repaid by 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Net liabilities will probably increase this year, mostly due to the Reliance Communications transaction, before falling in the financial year ending March 2021 as cash flows improve, said Somshankar Sinha, a Mumbai-based analyst at Jefferies India. “Reliance needs funds to refinance existing long-term debt or replace short-term debt with longer tenors, and to fund its announced acquisitions.”Reliance has agreed to pay about 173 billion rupees to purchase spectrum, mobile-phone towers and fiber assets from Reliance Communications and another 50 billion rupees for textile-maker Alok Industries, which it won in an auction under India’s bankruptcy rules.There are investments planned for the fiber-based broadband services, JioGigaFiber, that will launch across 1,100 cities in August under the umbrella of telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the people said. In addition, the conglomerate will spend on acquiring apparel brands and opening new retail outlets, one of the people said.Issuance ModeA spokesman for Reliance didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Reliance’s better-than-sovereign rating has helped it raise cheaper debt while actively investing cash reserves that reached 781 billion rupees last financial year. Other income accounted for about a fifth of its profit before tax in the 12 months to March 31 -- much of it earned by investing the cash. The company has a BBB+ credit score from S&P Global Ratings, two levels higher than the Indian government.Reliance returned to the local-currency bond market after a more-than- seven-year absence last year, raising 200 billion rupees via six offerings between August and November. The conglomerate priced some notes maturing in three years or slightly more in the range of 6.78 percent to 7.07 percent -- lower than the 7.15 percent average yield on top-rated three-year corporate bonds during the same period.Unit Reliance Jio on Tuesday sought bids to raise 15 billion rupees via three-year notes after tapping the rupee bond market four times already this year.“Due to the company’s strong financials and top-notch rating, it can raise funds from the debt markets at much lower levels as compared to other private Indian companies,” said Killol Pandya, head of fixed income at Essel Finance AMC Ltd.

2018-07-19,"MUMBAI: Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries is in talks with banks to raise up to $2.5 billion in loans from overseas market as it steps up pace of investments in telecom and retail businesses, four people familiar with the matter said.RIL is negotiating with more than a dozen banks to arrange the loan in single or multiple tranches as it rolls out fibre network and sets up more retail stores, said those people who did not want to be identified. This loan is to refinance existing offshore debt raised about two and a half years ago and would reduce average borrowing cost or extent maturities, said one of the persons cited above.The loans are expected to be priced between 100 and 125 basis points above Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) with a likely tenor of 3-5 years.Road Shows to Start SoonThis is the pricing that investors are demanding at this point though nothing has been finalised yet, they said. Road shows are expected to start within a few weeks, said another person mentioned above. “As a part of its ongoing liability management programme, RIL continues to look at opportunities to refinance debt at very competitive rates of financing,” a RIL spokesperson said in response to ET’s queries.Reliance, one of the best rated firms in India, could successfully raise debt and refinance with cheaper facilities in the past. The new fundraising comes after chairman Ambani told shareholders that it would further expand its telecommunication business.“While India has pole-vaulted into global leadership in the mobile broadband space… we still lag behind significantly in fixed-line broadband,” said Mukesh Ambani, at the recent shareholders meet. “Optical fiber based fixed-line broadband is the future. Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband, too.”The petroleum-to-retail-stores conglomerate has invested more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore in telecom industry in the past few years attempting to capture a major share of the rising digital consumption – from data to multimedia and streaming of movies and entertainment content on various platforms. It is also aggressively expanding its retail venture.For the full fiscal year, the company may raise about Rs 40,000 crore, or $5.8 billion, in new loans, reported Bloomberg. As the company expands its network, its loans have also been steadily climbing. Its total debt has tripled in the past five years as it borrowed to fuel more than Rs 3.3 lakh crore supporting its capex. The company has total borrowings of about Rs 2.2 lakh crore which is due by 2022, Bloomberg data shows.Reliance’s better-than-sovereign rating has helped it raise cheaper debt while investing cash reserves that reached Rs 78,000 crore last financial year.

DoT’s showcause notice to RCom was sent in the last week of June.In its response, RCom pointed out that the department held bank guarantees worth Rs 2,540 crore which the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) directed the DoT to return to the company.DoT, however, has stood its ground for the fresh bank guarantee, with officials saying the department intends to appeal the TDSAT ruling in the Supreme Court.“The notice was received and replied to earlier this month. The amount of `774 crore will be given in bank guarantees, but DoT also has to return the bank guarantees with them as ordered by TDSAT,” said one of the persons aware of the developments.In its reply, RCom pointed out that the bank guarantees were not interest-bearing and the delay in paying up was not causing any loss to DoT, the person said.But it wasn’t immediately clear from where RCom would arrange the funds, since it has been unable to repay thousands of crores owed to financial and operational creditors and is banking on asset sales for that. Once India’s second-largest telco, the company was unable to cope with brutal competition and forced to shut its wireless business at the end of 2017 amid rising debt, plunging revenue and widening losses. If the company doesn’t furnish the bank guarantees in time, the DoT is unlikely to approve of the company’s spectrum sale, delaying the deal with Jio.And if the licences are cancelled—as the DoT has threatened to do citing breach of licence conditions—then the spectrum would be taken over by the department, rendering the RCom-Jio deal meaningless. The companies would need to then move court, in which case the whole deal would get delayed till a favourable order comes in.RCom declined to comment on the matter as of Sunday evening. Late December RCom unveiled an over Rs 18,000-crore deal to sell most of its wireless assets—including 122 MHz of spectrum, the fibre network, telecom towers and nodes—to Jio. Besides, Canada’s Brookfield will purchase the company’s real estate in New Delhi and Chennai for about Rs 800 crore. Jio is also expected to take on deferred spectrum liabilities—to be paid to the government— and other dues of about Rs 8,000 crore.The funds are to be used to repay its 39 financial lenders. The deal, which was initially expected to close by March, ran into legal challenges, which have been cleared now. RCom expects it to now close in the July-September quarter. One of the sources quoted said that save a couple of major banks, the rest of the 39 banks that are financial creditors to RCom have given a no-objection certificate to the deal, and the rest would come through in a week's time.Earlier this month, the TDSAT had directed DoT to release Rs 2,000 crore worth of bank guarantees that RCom had provided in 2016 to secure the payment of spectrum-related charges. The company had approached the tribunal contesting the demand for bank guarantees for one-time spectrum charges (OTSC) due towards payment of market-linked prices for excess spectrum held by a telco, which DoT raised in late 2015.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/furnish-bank-guarantees-or-lose-licences-dot-to-reliance-communications/articleshow/65096964.cms

2018-07-24,"Reliance Industries is looking to sell more naphtha, bringing its total naphtha exports through tenders for August lifting at 185,000 tonnes, traders said, the highest monthly spot volumes offered by the company since February. However, some 60 percent of the August volumes were considered off-specification as the grade does not meet the requirements of the petrochemical industry standard, the traders added.  It is unclear why Reliance's naphtha contains more oxygenates than usual. Reliance officials were not available for immediate comment. Reliance had offered the long-range tanker size cargo for end-August loading from Sikka Port in western India through a tender which closes on Wednesday.  But the cargo contains 100 parts per million (ppm) of total oxygenates, twice the acceptable amount for making petrochemicals.  The fuel, however, could still be used but only if buyers have the means to lower the oxygenates levels.  Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, has already sold one such cargo with 100 ppm oxygenates to Vitol for early August loading at discounts to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.  Traders said the off-specification cargoes came at a time when European naphtha arriving next month in Asia was lower versus July.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/reliance-offers-more-naphtha-but-non-petchem-grade/articleshow/65124589.cms
2018-07-25,"ET Intelligence Group: Stock market analysts are in a quandary over Reliance Industries — India’s largest company by profit. They are unsure how to arrive at the fair value of Reliance Industries: is it a telecom play — deciphering which requires the skills of telecom analysts; or, is it an energy story — tracking which is the job of oil and gas analysts.The fair value is calculated by summing the values of respective businesses — refining and petrochemical, telecom, and retail.But, here lies the dilemma: energy analysts following Reliance stick to a few set of data points and management commentary in marking their ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation; however, telecom analysts take into account multiple factors and a greater disclosure; besides, a different accounting by Reliance makes it difficult for them to compare the numbers with peers in the telecom business.What further fuels confusion is the difference in the opinion of the two groups of analysts. Most oil and gas analysts are bullish on Reliance’s huge capital investments in the new telecom business; they think it makes sense to deploy the free cash generated from the energy division to telecom. (RIL could generate well over US$5 billion in cash flow from its refining and petrochem businesses from FY19.) However, most telecom analysts — often influenced by the raging tariff war — believe that the company’s low average revenue per user (ARPU) and incremental subscribers’ growth from its feature phone will stretch the payback period of its investments. This, according to them, would keep Jio’s returns on investments at sub-optimal levels. A Kotak Institutional Equities report expects return on capital employed on Jio will reach double-digits not before 2025 with free cash flow expected in 2023.Within security houses and among analysts, RIL is being gradually perceived as a consumer play, rather than an energy story — given that long-term earning triggers are driven by the consumer businesses (telecom and retail).Indeed, the number of energy analysts tracking RIL has dropped to 40 from 56 five years ago, according to Bloomberg data. Like analysts, even retail investors and fund managers may have been left wondering whether RIL is a consumer or energy play.The bias towards the consumer vertical is evident in the July 10 initiation report on Reliance Industries by Credit Suisse. It states that refining and petrochem are “well understood businesses” while Jio has the ability to create significant value from the ecosystem it is building.In the past five years, RIL has invested close to $75 billion — probably the largest capital expenditure (capex) exercises by an Indian company ever. The company earmarked this investment across various business segments such as upgrading refineries, setting up of Jio’s infrastructure, and expanding its retail division.Close to 45 per cent of these investments is in Jio. It is estimated that an additional $16-18 billion will be invested in Jio over the next five years. As a result, energy analysts are roping in their colleagues in the telecom desk to value RIL. But even as they work together, their views differ. However, the energy analyst (still considered to be the lead analyst in RIL) has the final word.Most telecom analysts are unable to comprehend the magnitude and possible impact of supplier’s credit (to Jio from equipment manufacturers) — as high as 22% of the capex. They are further confused while trying to compare the financials with other telecom companies which follow a different accounting policy.Historically, however, digital companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet) have outlived analyst expectations. The potential size of the market and the possible growth in revenues are known unknowns of such businesses.No wonder, most analysts have been unable to accurately estimate the revenue potential of these companies – a fact that has emboldened oil and gas analysts.The Bloomberg consensus target price for RIL — the level analysts believe the stock would touch in a year — rose to Rs 1,111.8 from Rs 601 at the end of 2016. Given the current stock price of Rs 1,110, most analysts seem to have ruled out fresh upsides in FY19. In the next few quarters they would closely track the performance of Jio’s broadband services, slated to be launched in 1,100 cities, beginning 15th August. The company said it plans to enter the living rooms of 50 million households.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-spreading-its-wings-leaves-street-amazed-analysts-dazed/articleshow/65127291.cms
2018-07-25,"NEW DELHI: This $164 billion fund owns roughly Rs 80,000 crore worth of Indian shares, making it the largest foreign portfolio investor (FPI) in India.Private lender HDFC Bank (fourth), Reliance Industries (sixth), Kotak Mahindra Bank (14th) are a few Indian stocks, which were among its top 25 holdings in value terms as of June 30.A part of American Funds, owned by investment management firm Capital Group, this is EuroPacific Growth Fund.As the name suggests, the fund focuses mainly on Europe, but its exposure to India as percentage of its net assets was significant at 7.4 per cent as of June 30, according to the fund’s website. This, at a rupee-dollar exchange rate of 69, stood at Rs 84,000 crore.PRIME Database Group pegs EuroPacific Growth Fund’s total Indian stock holding at Rs 78,473 crore, and that of Capital Group as a whole – which includes Capital World Growth & Income Fund, New World Fund Inc, Smallcap World Fund and Europacific Growth funds – at Rs 96,764.20 crore. Individual fund or group-wise, it is India’s largest foreign investor, PRIME Database confirmed to ETMarkets in an email. This, it says, is based on data available for only those companies where the fund or the group holds more than 1 per cent stakes. Two years back, the fund’s total holding in Indian market stood at Rs 51,564 crore.PortfolioThe US-based fund hiked stake in HDFC Bank, TVS Motor, UltraTech Cement and State Bank of India in June quarter while trimming its exposure to Grasim Industries and Eicher Motors, June quarter shareholding data showed.Data suggests the fund held 10,70,36,464 shares, or 5.02 per cent stake, in HDFC Bank as of June 30, against 9,88,65,874 shares, or 4.66 per cent stake, it held as of March 31, 2018. This 5.02 per cent stake alone was worth roughly Rs 29,000 crore.In case of TVS Motor, the fund increased its exposure to 3.12 per cent at the end of June quarter from 2.74 per cent at the end of March quarter and 2.68 per cent at the end of December quarter, Ace Equity data showed.At a time when there were concerns over the health of public sector lenders, this fund bought 49,22,000 additional shares in SBI to raise its holding to 1.17 per cent from 1.12 per cent. In UltraTech Cement, it hiked its stake to 1.15 per cent from 1.03 per cent. Calendar 2018 has not panned out well for emerging markets, thanks to the onset of Sino-US trade war, rise in crude oil prices and concerns over the Fed tightening. India, too, has been at the receiving end. The country has seen outflow of portfolio money worth Rs 6,430 crore in the first six months of the year.Despite this, the equity indices have hit new highs, as money continued to chase the largecaps. Thus, a look at what the biggest FPIs are doing is noteworthy.Ace Equity data suggests EuroPacific Growth Fund cut its holding from 2.37 per cent to 2.20 per cent in Eicher Motors and from 2.41 per cent to 1.61 per cent in Grasim Industries, sequentially, in June quarter.During the quarter, the fund maintained its holding at 3.38 per cent in Reliance Industries, 1.25 per cent in ACC, 2.65 per cent in Ambuja Cements, 2.66 per cent in Axis Bank, 1.89 per cent in HDFC, 4.94 per cent in Kotak Mahindra Bank, 1.34 per cent in Mahindra & Mahindra and 1.59 per cent Motherson Sumi.This list may grow when more companies report their shareholding patterns in the days to come.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/largest-fpi-in-indian-market-has-just-topped-up-on-ril-sbi-hdfc-bank/articleshow/65128845.cms
2018-07-25,"The government has moved Delhi High Court to enforce a USD 3.8 billion recovery from Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC following an English court ruling over its share from the Panna-Mukta and Tafields in western offshore, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today. The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in the fields. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40 per cent interest while RIL and Shell hold 30 per cent each. In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said that based on the Final Partial Award (FPA) dated October 12, 2016, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had on May 25, 2017, raised demand for USD 3.8 billion on ONGC, RIL and Shell towards government of India share of profit petroleum and royalty. RIL and Shell challenged the FPA before the High Court in London. ONGC was not party to the arbitration. ""The High Court, London rejected the petition filed by RIL and Shell on April 16, 2018, except on one issue which was remanded to the Arbitral Tribunal,"" he said. ""For enforcement of the FPA, Government has filed a petition before the Delhi High Court."" In December 2010, BG Exploration & Production India Ltd, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL, initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state's share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast. The Arbitration Tribunal gave its FPA on October 12, 2016. RIL and Shell initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016. On May 2, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgment, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing of eight other issues, RIL had said on May 24. The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award, it had said. It had insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it. BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for the increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts. ""Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,"" RIL had said. ""Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings."" Pradhan said out of the four arbitration initiated by RIL in respect of its Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, only two are under adjudication.  The firm has withdrawn the arbitration against a delay in notifying a gas price and the one against taking away of some area in the KG-D6 block after the expiry of stipulated timeframe.  The arbitrations under adjudication include one against the government disallowing certain costs for KG-D6 output not meeting the targets because of non-drilling of stipulated wells, he said. The second arbitration is against the government seeking compensation from RIL and its partners for producing natural gas belonging to state-owned ONGC, he added.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/govt-moves-delhi-hc-to-recover-3-8-bn-from-ril-shell-ongc/articleshow/65135750.cms

The figure was at $11 per barrel in the sequential quarter ended March 2018.Commenting on the results, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said: “Our petrochemicals business generated record EBITDA with strong volumes and an upswing in polyester chain margins. Refining business performance remained steady despite the seasonal weakness in cracks. Continuing strength in global demand for oil products and implementation of more stringent environmental norms for marine fuels augurs well for our refining business.”June quarter revenue from refining and marketing segment increased by 42.9 per cent YoY to Rs 95,646 crore while segment EBIT declined 16.8 per cent YoY to Rs 5,315 crore. Lower crude throughput due to planned turnaround of one crude distillation unit and softer refining margins led to decline in segment EBIT on YoY basis.R&M performance was also impacted by higher flat price and adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials on YoY basis.For the quarter ended June, revenue from the petrochemicals segment increased by 58.2 per cent YoY to Rs 40,287 crore due to 35 per cent increase in volumes and about 24 per cent higher realisations.Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs 7,857 crore supported by strong YoY volume growth led by successful stabilization of the world’s largest ROGC, its downstream units and PX-4.Reliance Jio reported net profit of Rs 612 crore in Q1FY19 over net profit of Rs 510 crore in the sequential quarter ended March 2018.

2018-07-28,"Robust earnings in the petrochemical, retail and telecom businesses in the June quarter should sustain investor interest in the stock of Reliance Industries, which has outperformed the Nifty by 14% so far this year.The pronounced outperformance is likely to continue because of the upward revision in target prices due to the record-high operating margins of the petrochemical business and almost stable average revenue per user (ARPU) in the telecom arm, RJio. Furthermore, sustained buoyancy in retail sales should point to a stronger retail footprint for India’s second-most valuable company.The petrochemical segment’s operating margin (EBIT) improved 370 basis points YoY to 19.5% owing to higher utilisation of the new units. Petrochemical volumes remain unchanged at 9.2 million tons in the June quarter sequentially. Operating profit margins still expanded 260 basis points in the same period. Operating profit of petrochemicals at ₹7,857 crore was nearly ₹400-500 crore higher than analysts’ expectations and contributed almost half of the total operating profit of the company.Earnings growth momentum in the petrochemical business helped offset the moderation in earnings from the refining business due to softness in the Singapore gross refining margins (GRM). Consequently, GRM in the June quarter dropped $0.5 per barrel to $10.5 on a sequential basis.With petrochemical expansions providing the anticipated financial benefits, the Street should raise earnings targets for the company. Higher utilisation of petrochemical units will support core energy earnings in FY19, while in the next fiscal, the same impact will be reflected in the refining earnings as the division will get the full benefits of the petcoke gassification project, boosting GRM by $1.5-2 per barrel. Analysts expect about 55% of the total incremental operating profit between FY18 and FY20 to be contributed by the new refining and petrochemical units.Also, RJio has been able to surprise the Street: ARPU dropped just 1.5% to ₹134.5 sequentially, while Airtel’s ARPU declined by 9.5% in the same period. Reliance’s telecom arm added 28.7 million subscribers in the June quarter from 26 million in the previous quarter. This suggests subscriber addition is happening at a decent pace, and profitably. It could support higher valuations of the telecom vertical as analysts may have to advance their higher ARPU estimate to FY20 from FY21. The Street is currently ascribing ₹250-300 per share to RJio.The retail business of Reliance sparkled in the quarter. It recorded a 134% growth in revenue in the fourth quarter of FY18. However, the Street ignored that performance as an aberration. But revenue growth in the June quarter again more than doubled to ₹25,890 crore.If the rate sustains, the current quarterly rate on an annualised basis will translate into revenue crossing ₹1 lakh crore, which would be higher than all the organised retail players combined. The EBIT margin of the retail segment improved to 4.1% in the June quarter from 2.5% in the year-ago period because of cost control, scalability and superior operating leverage.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-rally-likely-to-continue-on-strong-petchem-margins-stable-rjio-arpu/articleshow/65172112.cms

According to a Bloomberg poll of equity brokers, RIL’s net profit was seen at ₹9,554 crore and net sales at ₹126,900 crore in the quarter.“Financial results of 1Q FY19 underscore the strength of the petrochemicals (business) we have reinforced over the last investment cycle,” chairman Mukesh Ambani said. “Our petrochemicals business generated record EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation), with strong volumes and an upswing in polyester chain margins. Refining business performance remained steady despite the seasonal weakness in cracks.”RIL’s petrochemical business, which represents around 30% of the company’s revenue, boosted profits as volumes rose 35% and realisation was 24% higher, as its recently commissioned paraxylene (PX) plant performed at full capacity.“Our petrochemical production is over 9 million tonnes in the quarter, which was what we produced in an entire year before we undertook expansion beginning 2013.

2018-07-29,"Exactly a decade after it started production, the MA oil and gas field in the Krishna Godavari basin block KG-D6 will seize to produce from September, said Reliance Industries which has battled quicker than anticipated decline in output at a block that once was its pride. Reliance has till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009. ""MA field cessation expected by September 2018,"" the company said in an investor presentation post announcing first-quarter earnings. The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter, Reliance said in the presentation. MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 & D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 & D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd. Output thereafter has only declined. Reliance said KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 & D3 and MA fields. In April the company had stated that ""adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields"". While the company had not provided any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields then, it has now said MA field would shut in September. The shutdown coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field. Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent. The government's Site Restoration Guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities. Reliance had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of $8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest $2.234 billion, which was scaled down to $1.96 billion in 2012. The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time. RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries -- R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output. Initial gas will start flowing from 2020.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-to-shut-ma-oil-field-in-kg-d6-block-in-september/articleshow/65184384.cms
2018-07-29,"The cash-rich Reliance Industries, which also is one of the biggest forex loan borrowers in the country, is set to tap the foreign debt market to raise USD 2.7 billion to refinance its existing high cost debt. As of the June 2018 quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-led company had an outstanding debt of Rs 2,42,116 crore, which rose from Rs 2,18,763 crore from March 2018, while cash in hand marginally rose to Rs 79,492 crore. The company had spent around Rs 22,000 crore in capex during the quarter mostly into the still cash-burning telecom venture, and reported a net income of Rs 9,459 crore. Its outstanding debt has been rising as its fledgling telecom business continues to drain cash. ""We are planning to raise USD 2.7 billion in forex debt through the course of the fiscal 2019. The money will be raised in multiple tranches and will be used to refinance some of our existing high cost forex debt,"" a senior company official told over the weekend refusing to reveal more information. More than half of Reliances around USD 34 billion debt is due for repayment by 2022, while around USD 13 billion is maturing from 2018 through 2020. Most of the outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Reliance has sought shareholders approval to issue redeemable non-convertible debentures at its July 5 AGM, it said in its annual report. Due to the high rating at BBB+ (by S&P Global Ratings) which is two notches higher than the sovereign rating, Reliance can raise cheaper funds. Moodys has a Baa2 rating on the company, a notch above the governments rating. Reliance is the only private sector company in the country that has issued perpetual bonds to foreign investors a few years back. The only other domestic entity to tap the perpetual bond market is the state-run State Bank of India. According to investment bankers, Reliances repayments from 2018 through 2020 will be its biggest for any three-year period in the past and include about USD 8.14 billion term loans, USD 3.52 billion bonds and a USD 300 million revolver loan. It also has about USD 1.65 billion in interest payments. In the June 2018 quarter its finance cost jumped more than threefold to Rs 3555 crore on an annualised basis. The retail-to-refining giant debt has trebled over the past five years as it invested a whopping USD 37 billion in a telecom venture and to bolster its traditional petrochemicals business which included a pet coke gasification unit and in expanding petrochemicals capacities. Telecom is still cash burning having sucked in around Rs 22,000 crore in the June quarter. During the recent AGM, the billionaire owner Ambani, who is the richest Asian, said his vision for the group was to become a consumer company over the next decade. Already, 31 per cent of its revenue is coming from retail and telecom business as per its June quarter numbers. In the June quarter, Jio, was launched just two years ago, had reported a net income of Rs 612 crore, while the market leader Airtel had plunged into a whopping Rs 980 crore loss from its domestic operations. Jio with it loads of cheap data offering, entry has crippled the once-sun-shine telecom market. The record net income in the June quarter was led by bumper earnings from retail business, improved profitability of telecom arm and near-doubling of earnings from petrochemical business offset lower margins from oil refining business. Consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore was 17.9 per cent higher than Rs 8,021 crore that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate had netted and exclude a Rs 1,087 crore exceptional income from the sale of a stake in Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp.

2018-07-30,"Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon may soon face intense competition from Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail, which has just ventured into online sales of smartphones, televisions, refrigerators and air-conditioners, two senior industry executives said. Reliance Retail, which is the country’s largest brick-and-mortar retail chain, has launched an online shop front for its smartphone and electronics format Reliance Digital, which is also the country’s largest electronics retailer. These categories are the largest pie of Indian e-commerce accounting for almost 55-60% of the business of Amazon and Flipkart. Reliance will be gearing up to take a sizeable share of online sales of smartphones, televisions and electronics for the upcoming festive season with price-competitive deals and offers matching that of these two top online marketplaces.An industry executive said Reliance will run heavy discounting from time to time on some products like exclusive models and old models like other online marketplaces, while other products will be priced at par with the Reliance Digital offline stores. “Nevertheless, Reliance Digital already has an aggressive pricing for its offline stores which are, at times, even the lowest in the market and top brands like LG, Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi and Panasonic now control most of the online discounts so pricing will be quite competitive with Amazon and Flipkart,” he said. The company will also differentiate itself with its in-house service wing, ResQ, which does installation, demo and aftersales service for the products. The Reliance Digital and smaller Jio stores will act as fulfilment centres for the online orders. Reliance was piloting online sales of mobile phones and consumer electronics for employees for over a year. “The commercial operation has just been launched across India. While this is an omni-channel expansion of Reliance Digital, there will be dedicated focus on making the online operation successful,” another executive said. An email sent to Reliance Retail did not elicit any response till Sunday press time.Online accounts for around 38% of India’s smartphone sales, while for televisions it is around 12% and 6-7% for appliances. For personal care gadgets like shavers and dryers, online is around 15-20% of total sales. Flipkart, Amazon, Paytm Mall, and Xiaomi’s Mi online store are the largest players in online sales of smartphones and electronics in India. Currently, Reliance runs ecommerce operations for the fashion formats — Ajio.com and Reliance Trends, and online grocery, FMCG, fruits and vegetables under Reliance Smart which is at present limited to Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru. The company has plans to scale up Reliance Smart across the country.Reliance Digital has 305 stores as of June, and 4,530 smaller Jio Points that also sell smartphones and do catalogue selling of appliances and televisions. Around 10% of the Reliance Digital sales last quarter were driven by catalogue sales through the Jio stores. Reliance Digital sales last fiscal crossed.`15,100 crore accounting for around 34% of the retail business revenue.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-takes-fight-to-flipkart-amazon-doorsteps/articleshow/65191502.cms

2018-07-30,"Mumbai: Two index heavyweights — RIL and ICICI Bank — could provide extra legs to the Nifty rally going by their quarterly results, which foreign investors cheered post Indian market closing Friday. The ICICI ADR rose 4.4 per cent to $8.72 as the pace of NPA creation slowed. RIL’s London traded GDR rose 1.9 per cent at $32.75 after the company posted a stellar Q1 profit. Both these stocks are likely to open higher on Monday when trading resumes and witness an extended rally.RIL, which closed at Rs 1,128, could rise another 6.4 per cent to Rs 1,200 this month. The stock faces stiff resistances at Rs 1,160 and Rs 1,180, options data indicate. Rajesh Palviya, derivatives head at Axis Securities, expects the rally could extend to Rs 1,200. “RIL’s likely to open gap-up Monday and have a go at Rs 1,200 this month,” Palviya added.Bullishness in the stock is evident in the huge put selling witnessed on the derivatives counter Friday pre-results. Both 1,120 and 1,100 puts witnessed huge additions to open interest (OI) — traders’ outstanding positions. The 1,120 strike saw selling of 10.83 lakh shares to 12.57 lakh shares, while the 1,100 strike added 12.72 lakh shares (21.61 lakh).“Such huge put writing implies strong trader optimism,” said Chandan Taparia, derivatives analyst, Motilal Oswal Commodities. “RIL gets solid support at 1,100, while we could see more upside to at least 1,180.”Options formed at the beginning of the August series indicate a Rs 1,100 -1,200 range for RIL this month, with greater odds of an upside. However, derivatives analysts added that trading ranges could shift given the relatively longer expiry through August 30.ICICI Bank’s ADR saw investors give a thumbs-up to the Q1 results despite the historic loss with signs of NPAs bottoming out. Taparia expects the stock to rise from Friday’s Rs 292.25 towards Rs 303, which has offered a “veritable” resistance since May. That also implies 3.8 per cent upside from Friday’s level.He added that if the stock closed above the Rs 303 resistance, it could have a shy at Rs 320 this month. Going by early OI formation, trading range for August is Rs 280-300.RIL has an 8.35 per cent weightage in the Nifty and ICICI Bank 3.22 per cent. Palviya expects the Nifty could rally further with help from these stocks.The range for the Nifty this month is 11,000-11,500 but market analysts like Rajesh Baheti, director, Crosseas Capital, have done a bull call spread, comprising purchase of an 11,500 call and simultaneous sale of an 11,800 call for the August 30 expiry, implying that the current rally could surpass 11,500.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-icici-bank-could-fuel-nifty-rally/articleshow/65192021.cms

2018-07-30,"Emkay Global Financial Services has a buy call on Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management with a target price of Rs 314.The current market price of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management is Rs 253.30.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by Emkay Global:Equity AUM growth remains encouraging– Debt AUM witnessed redemptions: RNAM’s equity AUM witnessed robust rise of nearly 38 per cent yoy even as overall AUM growth was softer, 7.8 per cent yoy, due to redemption pressure primarily in debt-MF schemes during Q1FY19. Retail MAAUM (including in debt schemes) continued to perform strongly increasing 33.5 per cent yoy, improving total retail mix on MAAUM stood at 32.4 per cent.SIP growth continues to remain strong– Higher persistency in AUM likely: The SIP book grew by nearly 62 per cent yoy to Rs100bn vs 61bn last year. Total SIP inflows forms nearly 35 per cent of Equity AUM with total account base of nearly 2.8mn. Interestingly, nearly 75 per cent of incremental SIP have tenure of more than 5 years. We strongly believe that with rising share of SIP contribution, AUM persistency would improve with relatively lower volatility in inflows.Investments in efficient franchise expansion continues: RNAM continued to expand with adding presence in 16 new locations during the quarter. Despite such vivid expansion, the Opex during the quarter declined by nearly 14 per cent sequentially. RNAM is now present in 298 locations with solo presence in close nearly 100 locations.SEBI latest regulation on fees will be pass through: RNAM adjusted the SEBI directed reduction in fees (for B15 to B30 cities) by similar reductions in distributor commissions. Hence, the disruptions to core fees remained minimal.Retain ‘BUY’ with price target of Rs 314: We expect RNAM to maintain strong position in the AMC business and incrementally benefit from its efforts to penetrate the B15 and B30 locations. Given RNAM’s high dividend payout (70 per cent of FY18 net profit), we constructed a dividend discount model to arrive at a per share value of Rs314. Our FY19E / FY20E EPS Rs10.2 / Rs11.7 discounts the target price 31x / 27x respectively.

2018-07-31,"Axis Bank has been doing provisioning from the last three quarters and that has helped them reach 69% of the PCR including technical write off account and they are better off than ICICI Bank, Ashutosh Mishra, Lead Analyst- Institutional Equity (Banking and NBFC), Reliance Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: What is your take on HDFC Bank’s QIP? Would this be like other issues in the past and see mega oversubscription?It is a technical definition. If it is five times, it is mega and even if it is two times, it is mega but we clearly see the demand for this QIP is very strong. It will get subscribed within a given timeframe. Overall it would be positive for banks in terms of being book value accretive. Book value will go up and it will support the future growth of HDFC Bank.What about Axis Bank results? They came up with better than anticipated growth. NII provisioning has come in low on a sequential basis. More importantly, there has been a steep improvement in their asset quality too?Axis Bank has shown all around improvement in this quarter and the only negative was that some more accounts have been added in the below investment grade category. Apart from that. they have shown improvement in all major fronts. On management front, it has guided that this is the last of such a large addition to the below investment in their portfolio. Going forward, they see the normalisation of that.We were just comparing a little while back on how the positioning would change between Axis as well as ICICI Bank post this earnings quarter. Where would your bias lie?I am still biased towards Axis because when you are coming out of this asset quality problem, one has to see how much provision you have done and what will be the P&L impact going forward from here. When we put both ICICI and Axis in this, we find Axis to be much better placed compared to ICICI Bank. Axis Bank is doing provisioning from the last three quarters and that has helped them to reach 69% of the PCR including technical write off account. We hear RBI is coming out with another list of stressed accounts and the banks will need to increase the provisioning because of NPA recognition from earlier years. Even if that happen, it probably will not have any major impact on banks which have a higher PCR and in that category Axis is better placed than ICICI.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/why-ashutosh-mishra-of-reliance-securities-prefers-axis-bank-to-icici/articleshow/65208105.cms

2018-08-01,"NEW DELHI: An arbitration panel has issued an award in favour of Reliance-led consortium in the so-called gas migration dispute case, RIL said in a late evening filing to the stock exchange.The panel has rejected the government’s contention that Reliance and its partners unjustly gained by producing gas from ONGC’s fields in the KG basin and must return the gains by paying $1.55 billion to the government.“All the contentions of the consortium have been upheld by the majority with a finding that the consortium was entitled to produce all gas from its contract area and all claims made by the Government of India have been rejected. The consortium is not liable to pay any amount to the Government of India,” the company said. The tribunal also directed the government to pay $8.3 million, or Rs 56 crore, as the cost of arbitration to the consortium that includes BP Plc and Niko Resources.The arbitration tribunal was split two to one with GS Singhvi, the former Supreme Court judge and the government nominee on the panel, writing a long dissent note. Bernard Eder, a former UK High court judge nominated by Reliance, and Singapore-based Lawrence Boo were the other two arbitrators.As per the majority verdict, Reliance and its partners were well within their rights under the contract to produce the gas that had migrated from the ONGC fields in the KG Basin, and had not unjustly enriched themselves, according to people familiar with the arbitration award.The majority of the panel agreed with RIL’s view that the production sharing contract doesn’t prohibit the contractor from producing gas—irrespective of its source—as long as the producing wells were located inside the contract area, people familiar with the award said. The panel rejected the government’s plea that RIL had unjustly enriched itself on the ground that the company had made the required capex for extraction of gas and had also paid royalty and profit petroleum due to the government on all gas produced from the field, they said.In his dissent note, Singhvi cited two previous judgements on public trust doctrine and unjust enrichment. He also relied upon the reports by consultant D&M and the Shah panel, people cited above said.This is the second legal setback for the oil ministry in two months — Delhi High Court on May 31 ordered the government to extend Vedanta’s contract for the prolific Barmer block on the same terms as in the original contract. The government has appealed that order.GOVT REACTIONThe government is studying the gas arbitration award and may challenge it in court in the near future although no decision has yet been made, the people cited above said, adding that the dissent note by Singhvi will help in making an appeal in court. Any court appeal means the matter may drag on for many more months.An email sent to the oil ministry elicited no response till the time of going to press.The tribunal’s ruling contradicts the findings of an official panel led by retired judge AP Shah. The recommendations of that panel, published in 2016, formed the basis for the government’s demand of $1.55 billion from Reliance and its partners. Reliance had then called the government demand arbitrary and invoked arbitration proceedings.The dispute began in 2014 when state-run ONGC approached the Delhi High Court, complaining that gas from its blocks was being produced by Reliance. The two companies appointed D&M, a US-based consultant, to examine the issue.The government, which was directed by the court to resolve the matter, appointed the Shah panel to study the D&M report and recommend ways to prevent such incidents in future.The panel said RIL had unjustly gained by producing gas that didn’t belong to the company and must return the gains to the government, which owns the gas that state-run ONGC was yet to extract from the two fields it operated. Reliance had produced gas that had migrated to its field in the KG basin from ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 block and Godavari PML, which share borders with the RIL’s block.The government accepted all recommendations of the Shah panel, which said RIL must compensate the government, not ONGC, the original petitioner in the case. With this, the government replaced ONGC in the dispute with Reliance.The $1.55-billion demand included the alleged benefit RIL received by drawing ONGC’s gas until March 2016, the accumulated interest on the amount, and $175 million by way of additional cumulative profit petroleum.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/arbitration-panel-doesnt-find-ril-at-fault-in-ongc-row/articleshow/65221022.cms

The government has appealed that order.GOVT REACTIONThe government is studying the gas arbitration award and may challenge it in court in the near future although no decision has yet been made, the people cited above said, adding that the dissent note by Singhvi will help in making an appeal in court. Any court appeal means the matter may drag on for many more months.An email sent to the oil ministry elicited no response till the time of going to press.The tribunal’s ruling contradicts the findings of an official panel led by retired judge AP Shah. The recommendations of that panel, published in 2016, formed the basis for the government’s demand of $1.55 billion from Reliance and its partners. Reliance had then called the government demand arbitrary and invoked arbitration proceedings.The dispute began in 2014 when state-run ONGC approached the Delhi High Court, complaining that gas from its blocks was being produced by Reliance. The two companies appointed D&M, a US-based consultant, to examine the issue.The government, which was directed by the court to resolve the matter, appointed the Shah panel to study the D&M report and recommend ways to prevent such incidents in future.The panel said RIL had unjustly gained by producing gas that didn’t belong to the company and must return the gains to the government, which owns the gas that state-run ONGC was yet to extract from the two fields it operated. Reliance had produced gas that had migrated to its field in the KG basin from ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 block and Godavari PML, which share borders with the RIL’s block.The government accepted all recommendations of the Shah panel, which said RIL must compensate the government, not ONGC, the original petitioner in the case. With this, the government replaced ONGC in the dispute with Reliance.The $1.55-billion demand included the alleged benefit RIL received by drawing ONGC’s gas until March 2016, the accumulated interest on the amount, and $175 million by way of additional cumulative profit petroleum.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/arbitration-panel-doesnt-find-ril-at-fault-in-ongc-row/articleshow/65222102.cms

RIL shares surged 3.14 per cent to Rs 1,185.8 — its lifetime closing high on the BSE.There are a couple of reasons that supported buying an interest in the RIL’s stock after the June quarter results.

Local mutual funds were underweight by 6.7 per cent in their portfolio on the RIL stock compared with the Nifty weight at the end March 2018. According to Bloomberg data, domestic mutual funds such as HDFC MF, Kotak Mahindra, Tata MF have bought RIL in the June quarter.

2018-08-01,"The government is likely to appeal against a ruling by an international tribunal that rejected its USD 1.55 billion claim against Reliance Industries and its partners for allegedly siphoning gas from deposits they had no right to exploit.A three-member international arbitration tribunal by a majority vote held that Reliance could contractually produce and sell any gas that might have migrated from adjoining fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) into its area and that it was not obligated to seek prior permission of the government for doing so.With one member dissenting, the panel held that the production sharing contract for eastern offshore KG-D6 fields ""does not prohibit but permits"" Reliance ""to produce and sell gas which migrated into the sub-sea reservoir lying within (its) Contract Area from a source outside the Contract Area"".And so ""there is no question of 'unjust enrichment',"" it held. Reliance ""has not been and will not be unjustly enriched by any production of migrated gas as a result of Petroleum Operations conducted within its Contract Area"".A senior government official said the oil ministry is studying the arbitration award and would go in for an appeal.""To my mind, the arbitration award is flawed and one-sided and only remedy left is to go in for an appeal,"" he said.In his dissent note, G S Singhvi said that the PSC prohibits the Reliance and its partners from producing and selling gas which migrated into their sub-sea reservoir from Contract Area of ONGC.He held that Reliance ""unjustly enriched itself by the sale of migrated gas, which did not belong to it and, therefore, it is bound to restore those benefits to the Government"".In the 107-page order, the arbitration tribunal headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Lawrence G S Boo stated that although Reliance had always accepted that there could be channel continuity between its KG-D6 block and ONGC's adjoining KG-D5 and IG block, its conduct is consistent with its position that 'reservoir connectivity' has not been proven.Bernard Eder, a former UK High court judge nominated by Reliance, was the other judge who concurred with Boo. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and the government nominee on the panel, wrote a long dissent note.""The Claimant (Reliance) requires no further express permission to produce and sell any migrated gas that could have come into (its) Contract Area,"" the majority judgment held.On the company not informing the government of a report commissioned by its partner Niko Resources indicating connectivity between KG-D6 and neighbouring blocks of ONGC, the tribunal said ""the alleged failure to furnish information if so proven would at best be a breach of the contractual terms of the PSC or at worst attract penal sanctions under the Petroleum and Natural Gas (PNG) Rules"".""There is no logical nexus between such breach or non-compliance with the claimant's right to extract gas which might include gas which could have migrated from an area outside the Contract Area. These are distinct and discreet issues,"" it said.The tribunal said though Reliance's ""production of gas would have included gas which had migrated into the reservoir from a source outside the Contract Area"", it is ""entitled to all rights granted to it under the PSC and shall be entitled to retain and recover cost petroleum and profit petroleum from the gas so extracted, produced and sold"".The panel also awarded USD 8.3 million compensation to the three partners.Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10 per cent.In his dissent note, Singhvi said Reliance was required to obtain explicit permission to produce migrated gas.""It is crystal clear that the claimant (Reliance) does not have any rights to the gas which has migrated from ONGC's blocks,"" he wrote. ""There can be no doubt that the retention of the benefit of migrated gas would be 'against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience' thereby falling squarely within the ambit of the doctrine of unjust enrichment"".He also held that quantification of migrated gas determined in D&M report of 2015 was conclusive.Stating that Reliance should have disclosed the 2003 report of its partner Niko Resources, he said it may not have conclusively established reservoir connectivity, but it strongly suggested the same.""It is held that the claimant's failure to comply with its obligation to disclose November 2003 D&M report to the Government constitute a breach of the terms of the PSC and the 1959 Rules,"" he wrote.""Under the PSC, if a reservoir extends beyond block boundaries, the contractor may either seek permission to enlarge its Development Area, or jointly develop the area with the contractor of the adjoining block, or relinquish its rights to such reservoir,"" he said. ""There can be no effective lease or enjoyment of an area covered by a reservoir, if such reservoir is being drained by a different person on its block boundary.""The ministry had on November 4, 2016, slapped a demand notice on Reliance-BP-Niko combine for producing in seven years ending March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from ONGC's blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.Reliance on November 11, 2016, slapped an arbitration notice disputing the claim.The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee.The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been ""unjust enrichment"" to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to the production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.It relied on a report produced by petroleum industry consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton which concluded that gas had migrated from ONGC-controlled parts of the sea floor and the geological formations beneath it into areas controlled by the private companies.

2018-08-02,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has said the proposal to allow 49% foreign investment in online marketplaces that hold inventory and sell directly to consumers contradicts the government’s stated intent to strengthen Press Note 3, which bars any foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-based online retail.Concerns about this contradiction were raised by RIL representative at a meeting of the ecommerce think tank, set up by the government, on Monday, three sources told ET.“Reliance and all domestic companies said there should be no dilution of Press Note 3,” said a person who was present at the meeting. The draft ecommerce policy was released on Monday.It proposes that foreign investors can own up to 49% in majority Indian-owned and Indian-controlled marketplaces that hold inventory and sell locally manufactured products directly to consumers.The draft policy also states that the government will strengthen the enforcement of Press Note 3 by creating a separate wing in the Enforcement Directorate to handle grievances related to implementation of the provisions of this note. This note allows up to 100% FDI in marketplaces but stipulates that foreign-funded online ecommerce portals cannot hold inventory and sell to consumers directly.“These (the provision to allow 49% FDI and the provision to strengthen Press Note 3) are conflicting clauses,” said a person aware of the objections raised by Reliance, as allowing foreign investment in inventory holding online marketplaces will result in a dilution of press note 3.The RIL spokesperson did not reply to ET’s e-mailed queries. RIL, which has disrupted the telecom sector with free voice calls and rock-bottom data tariffs, is planning a deeper foray into ecommerce by integrating its retail and digital platforms.“As Reliance transitions to become a technology platform company, we see our biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-tooffline new ecommerce platform,” said the company’s chairman Mukesh Ambani at its 41st AGM last month.This ecommerce platform will directly pit India’s largest private company against the likes of Walmart, which is taking over Flipkart, and Amazon. Together, Amazon and Flipkart account for over 70 % of India’s ecommerce market.Incidentally, even Amazon and Walmart are opposed to the draft ecommerce policy, but for different reasons as reported by ET on Wednesday.They feel that the policy is heavily tilted against foreign firms and are likely to ask the US government to reach out to Indian policy makers in case the final policy is not moderated.As they own much more than 49 % in their Indian units, they will be barred from stocking inventory, while their rivals with 49% or less FDI will be able to sell directly to Indian consumers.They are especially wary of the proposed ecommerce regulator because they feel it will intervene in decisionmaking and slow down business operations, resulting in a new kind of ‘Licence Raj’.They are also worried about the provisions that seek to bar bulk purchases of branded goods by related party sellers as well as prevent group companies of ecommerce companies from taking actions that influence or distort the final sale.

2018-08-02,"NEW DELHI: Ericsson has urged the Supreme Court to reject a plea by Reliance Communications seeking the quashing of insolvency proceedings against it, saying such a move will rob the Swedish telecom equipment maker of security for dues to be paid by the telco.The apex court will decide the matter on Friday.Debt-ridden RCom filed a petition a week ago, asking the court to stop the insolvency proceedings against it. It also sought to quash a clause by an appellate tribunal making the completion of the carrier’s Rs 18,000 crore asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm and Canada’s Brookfield conditional on paying Ericsson Rs 550 crore by September 30. Funds from the planned asset sale are to be used to repay a consortium of 39 lenders to RCom, which has debt of some Rs 46,000 crore.The Anil Ambani-owned telco told the top court that the clauses are eroding the value of its assets since buyers are unwilling to go ahead. According to legal sources, RCom needs to complete the asset sale by August 27, otherwise it will be pushed back into insolvency again.Theoperator,which shut its wireless telephony services in late 2017, said on Thursday its management was willing to pledge payment of the settlement amount of Rs 550 crore to Ericsson by September 30, failing which the insolvency proceedings can restart. But for now, it sought quashing of the process.However, the counsel for Ericsson said if the company accepts RCom’s terms and the payment does not happen, it would be left in the lurch.“Such proposed modification completely takes away any security of payment to the respondent (Ericsson),” it said in the affidavit filed earlier this week.The affidavit added that in case the operator wants any changes in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s earlier order, then it has to “immediately pay the amount of Rs 550 crore…” RCom has signed deals to sell its wireless assets to Reliance Jio and some land to Brookfield for about Rs 18,000 crore. The funds will be used to pare its debt.The company managed to stave off insolvency proceedings, accepted by the dedicated bankruptcy court in May, when it decided to settle its dues with Ericsson before the NCLAT.Ericsson had signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom’s nationwide telecom network. The company alleged it had not been paid over Rs 1,000 crore.The appellate tribunal had ordered that if RCom and its units do not pay Ericsson the promised amount by the due date, which is September end, then all the proceeds from its asset sale will be reversed and the telco will be pushed into insolvency again.However, in its petition filed to SC last week, RCom said that both bankers and buyers had protested this clause. While Jio is wary that if later on challenged by Ericsson, the sale will be revoked, bankers are afraid that their recovered money would be lost as well, said the operator.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reject-reliance-communications-plea-to-quash-insolvency-proceedings-ericsson/articleshow/65249847.cms

2018-08-03,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today said the government will file an appeal in High Court against a ruling by an international tribunal which rejected its USD 1.55 billion claims against Reliance Industries for allegedly siphoning gas from fields operated by state-owned ONGC.A three-member international arbitration tribunal, by a majority vote last week, held that Reliance could contractually produce and sell any gas that might have migrated from adjoining fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) into its area and that it was not obligated to seek prior permission of the government for doing so.""The government will certainly file an appeal against the arbitration award in the higher forum,"" Pradhan said here.With one member dissenting, the arbitration panel had held that the production sharing contract for eastern offshore KG-D6 fields ""does not prohibit but permits"" Reliance ""to produce and sell gas which migrated into the sub-sea reservoir lying within (its) Contract Area from a source outside the Contract Area"".And so ""there is no question of 'unjust enrichment',"" it held. Reliance ""has not been and will not be unjustly enriched by any production of migrated gas as a result of Petroleum Operations conducted within its Contract Area"".Asked what will be the forum for appeal, Pradhan said, ""it will be in the High Court"".He said the government had made a claim on Reliance and its partners based on the recommendation of the Justice AP Shah Committee that quantified the natural gas that had migrated to KG-D6 from neighbouring blocks of ONGC.""Certainly, we will file an appeal,"" he said.In the 107-page order, the arbitration tribunal headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Lawrence G S Boo stated that although Reliance had always accepted that there could be channel continuity between its KG-D6 block and ONGC's adjoining KG-D5 and IG block, its conduct is consistent with its position that 'reservoir connectivity' has not been proven.Bernard Eder, a former UK High court judge nominated by Reliance, was the other judge who concurred with Boo. GS Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and the government nominee on the panel, wrote a long dissent note.""The Claimant (Reliance) requires no further express permission to produce and sell any migrated gas that could have come into (its) Contract Area,"" the majority judgment held.In his dissent note, Singhvi said that the PSC prohibits the Reliance and its partners from producing and selling gas which migrated into their sub-sea reservoir from Contract Area of ONGC.He held that Reliance ""unjustly enriched itself by the sale of migrated gas, which did not belong to it and, therefore, it is bound to restore those benefits to the Government"".The panel also awarded USD 8.3 million compensation to the three partners.Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10 per cent.In his dissent note, Singhvi said Reliance was required to obtain explicit permission to produce migrated gas.""It is crystal clear that the claimant (Reliance) does not have any rights to the gas which has migrated from ONGC's blocks,"" he wrote. ""There can be no doubt that the retention of the benefit of migrated gas would be 'against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience' thereby falling squarely within the ambit of the doctrine of unjust enrichment"".Pradhan's ministry had on November 4, 2016, slapped a demand notice on Reliance-BP-Niko combine for producing in seven years ending March 31, 2016, about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from ONGC's blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.Reliance on November 11, 2016, slapped an arbitration notice disputing the claim.The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee.The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been ""unjust enrichment"" to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to the production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.It relied on a report produced by petroleum industry consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton which concluded that gas had migrated from ONGC-controlled parts of the sea floor and the geological formations beneath it into areas controlled by the private companies. But Reliance had at that time stated that the methods were flawed.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-to-appeal-arbitration-ruling-on-reliance-ongc-dispute/articleshow/65254788.cms

Looking ahead, we expect TRP’s sales/EBITDA/PAT to clock 23 per cent/32 per cent/23 per cent CAGR through FY18-20E, while EBITDA margin is expected to improve by 365bps to 26.1 per cent. TRP acquired Unichem domestic and Nepal business for Rs 36bn (Nov-17). The deal is to be funded through 70-75 per cent debt (USD denominated debt not feasible due to regulatory issues). We expect higher interest cost and depreciation/ amortisation charges to suppress TRP’s earnings by 30.2 per cent and 26.2 per cent for FY19E and FY20E, respectively.We believe it is appropriate to value TRP on EV/EBITDA multiple (generates 60 per cent of its EBITDA from domestic business). Currently, the stock is trading at 16.4x and 13.7x of FY19E and FY20E EV/EBITDA, respectively while last three year 1YF mean EV/EBITDA is at 15.3x.

Investment rationale by Reliance Securities:Soft Sales Volume Restricts Revenue Growth: JKLC’s revenue grew by a mere 2.5 per cent YoY (+3 per cent QoQ) to Rs9.2bn led by muted 0.1 per cent YoY (+2.5 per cent QoQ) growth in volume to 2.29mnT. Notably, a significant gap in non-trade and trade segment prices especially in Northern region restricted JKLC to push more volume due to low margins. Further, RMC revenue stood at Rs420mn.Dismal Realisation and Cost Inflation Mar Operating Performance: EBITDA declined by 22 per cent YoY (-7 per cent QoQ) to Rs939mn due to dismal realisation and spike in operating cost led by higher Power & Fuel cost/tonne (+12 per cent YoY) and freight cost/tonne (+15 per cent YoY). While average realisation rose by 2.4 per cent YoY (+0.5 per cent QoQ) to Rs4,038/tonne, operating cost/tonne grew by 6.2 per cent YoY (+1.8 per cent QoQ) to Rs3,627. EBITDA/tonne stood at Rs410 vs. Rs527 and Rs454 in 1QFY18 and 4QFY18, respectively. Looking ahead, we believe likely improvement in Durg unit’s operational efficiencies and expected realisation recovery in key pockets are likely to aid JKLC’s operating performance in subsequent quarters. Net profit stood at Rs137mn (-51 per cent YoY and -59 per cent QoQ).Outlook & Valuation: Considering the initiatives undertaken to improve operations in Eastern markets by means of CPPs and SGU in Odisha, we expect JKLC’s operating performance to witness improvement from FY19E onwards. Current valuations of 8.1x EBITDA and US$57 EV/tonne for FY20E look attractive after recent correction. We maintain BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised Target Price of Rs380 (9x FY20 EBITDA).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-jk-lakshmi-cement-target-rs-380-reliance-securities/articleshow/65270077.cms
2018-08-06,"The talent division of IMG Reliance (IMGR) has signed cricketers Jasprit Bumrah and Krunal Pandya as clients. The a joint venture between IMG Worldwide and Reliance Industries has been managing Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya for over two years.As part of the multi-year contract, IMGR will manage all the commercial interests of the players, including their brand endorsements, off-field engagements and investments.“We have signed long-term contracts with Jasprit and Krunal and we will take care of their brands going forward. We are already having preliminary talks with a few brands that have shown great interest,” Nikhil Bardia, head of sponsorship sales at IMG Reliance, told ET.Bardia said that IMGR will be looking at signing a few endorsements for both Bumrah and Pandya at Rs 40-50 lakh per deal. “We are going to build their brand and not just sign endorsements.”IMGR launched its talent division in April 2016 and works with the sportspersons on strategic career management and providing resources and expertise to generate value in all facets and stages of career – except for their individual playing contracts. The firm has also been looking into recurring revenue streams via endorsements, appearances and licensing.However, it signed only two cricketers – Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya at the launch. And while the brand value of the two jumped manifolds, the company did not sign any new cricketers till recently.“We are very selective when it comes to signing clients as we want to ensure we create a brand and not just sign endorsement deals. When we signed Rohit, he had just three endorsement deals. We worked on realignment of his brand for six months. Today he is endorsing 13 brands and getting a value of Rs 40 crore from them,” Bardia said. “Next financial year, Rohit’s endorsements alone should earn Rs 55-60 crore.”Currently Sharma endorses CEAT, Adidas, Relispray, StarpPick, Sharp, Proatar, Oppo, Musically, Aristocrat – VIP bags, Walkaroo, Viktre, Hublot, and Trusox.Hardik Pandya, on the other hand, was charging Rs 15 lakh per endorsement when he signed with IMGR. Today, Bardia said, he charges Rs 1.5 crore per endorsement and has earned Rs 30 crore already. His current endorsements include Gulf Oil, Sin Denim, SG (Sanspareils Greenlands), Zaggle, Eume Bags, Audio tech company boAt, DFY, Bodycare, Oppo Plus and a men’s grooming brand.“Hardik is a youth brand. He is stylish, so he has associated with men’s grooming brand and other youth brands. Whereas Rohit is more senior, more experienced so we got him solo as well as joint brand endorsements to show him as a team player,” said Bardia.Rohit was earlier managed by Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment, which also manages Indian captain Virat Kohli.Bardia said that IMGR’s focus is not on signing too many players, but working with a select set long term. “It takes a lot of work to create a good brand. It takes multiple years. We have all the clients for a minimum of 3 years.”Incidentally, IMGR is also in talks with prospective companies to launch Rohit’s licensing businesses. “We are talking to three companies for licensing business but it takes time. It takes 6-12 months just to close a deal,” Bardia said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/img-reliances-talent-unit-signs-up-jasprit-bumrah-krunal-pandya/articleshow/65286089.cms

2018-08-08,"Rajesh K Dhingra, president, Reliance Defence & Aerospace, defends his company on the Rafale controversy after Congress chief Rahul Gandhi’s charges of nepotism. In an interaction with Manu Pubby, he details what the Dassault Reliance Aerospace (DRAL) JV will produce, how offsets for the Rafale deal will be rolled out and how focus is on Falcon executive jet and not the fighter aircraft. Congress says Reliance Defence has benefitted from a Rs 30,000-crore contract from the defence ministry (MoD), related to offsets for 36 Rafale aircraft...Reliance Defence or any other Reliance company has not received any contract from the MoD till date related to 36 Rafale aircraft. This is absolutely unfounded. It will be good to understand that as per the defence procurement policy, the foreign vendor has a choice to submit the details of its offset partners at the time of claiming offset credits. In this case, offset obligations are due only after September 2019. It is, therefore, possible that MoD has no formal communication from Dassault about choice of its partners for the offsets.The Opposition alleges that Reliance was selected due to proximity to the government.As per the procurement policy, the MoD has no role in selection of Indian Partners by the foreign vendors. This has been position right from 2005 when offsets were first introduced. In more than 50 offset contracts signed till date, the same process has been followed. Therefore, it is a deliberate attempt to mislead. Dassault is required to inform the MoD about its offset partners at the time of claiming credits, which I am sure they will do. Exact share of each company involved in the offset contracts will be known only after completion of offset obligations by Dassault, Thales, Safran, MBDA and others.It is also being pointed out that Reliance has no experience in making fighter aircraft?We should get our facts right. There are no fighter aircraft to be made as part of this contract as all aircraft are to be delivered as ‘Fly Away’ from France. No company in India, except HAL has the experience of making fighter aircraft. In any case, Reliance will be participating in offset program through DRAL. Dassault hold 49% in the company and brings with this 90 years of Aerospace manufacturing experience, thereby positioning DRAL as most qualified vendor.What will the JV with Dassault do in India for offsets said to be worth over Rs 30,000 crore?Dassault share of offsets is approximately 25% with remaining offset obligations being shared by Thales, Safran, MBDA and others. Therefore, the basic premise of Dassault givingRs 30,000 crore of offset contract to Reliance is totally unfounded. Dassault and its suppliers have already indicated more than 100 Indian companies that will participate in offset contracts. DRAL will not produce the Rafale jet in India. It will be making aero structures for the Falcon 2,000 executive jet and subsequently could assemble this commercial aircraft in India. This would be the first time that a commercial jet will be assembled in India.It is being said Reliance Defence was incorporated days before announcement of the Rafale deal?We incorporated three companies in December 2014. In February 2015, we publicly announced our entry in the Defence segment in presence of hundreds of media persons at Aero India. Formal notification was sent to Stock Exchange in February 2015. Ten more companies were incorporated during January to April 2015.

2018-08-10,"In a relief to Reliance Communications, the telecom tribunal has told department of telecommunications not to take any follow-up action till the tribunal next hears an appeal filed by the troubled telecom operator against DoT’s licence cancellation notice on September 10.This effectively means that the Anil Ambani-owned telco will get one more month to furnish bank guarantees worth Rs 774 crore to telecom department, which led to the strife between the two parties.Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Friday gave telecom department two weeks to file an affidavit and put its stance on record and then one week to RCom to file a rejoinder, according to lawyers present at the tribunal hearing.Till then DoT cannot cancel the telco’s licences, they said.The issue started when DoT issued two show-cause notices to RCom, threatening to cancel its licences in 14 circles and revoke spectrum allotted in 2013 and 2015. The telecom department in the notices cited breach of licence conditions and non-payment of spectrum dues.RCom moved TDSAT against DoT’s notices and has told the tribunal in prior hearings that cancelling licences would push the telco back into insolvency since it would not be able to complete its deal with Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio).RCom expects to raise Rs 18,000 crore from sales of wireless assets to Jio and real estate assets to Canada’s Brookfield, and reduce its Rs 46,000 crore debt by repaying lenders.The telco told DoT that it will shortly furnish bank guarantees worth Rs 774 crore and sell spectrum to Jio, which will from then on, take care of all future liabilities associated with those airwaves.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-gets-a-breather-tribunal-sets-next-hearing-over-dot-notice-for-september-10/articleshow/65358015.cms
2018-08-12,"Caught in a political storm over the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Group today denied receiving any contract from the Defence Ministry and said ""unfounded and incorrect"" allegations are being deliberately made to ""mislead people and cloud the issue."" Answering questions ranging from lack of experience to state-owned HAL being overlooked for the deal, the group said Dassault, the French firm that is to supply 36 Rafale fighter jets, chose Reliance Defence Ltd to meet its 'offset' or export obligation in the contract and the Ministry of Defence has no role in the selection of Indian partners by the foreign vendors.  Reliance Defence Ltd CEO Rajesh Dhingra said the government-to-government deal requires all 36 aircraft to be delivered in a 'fly-away' condition which means ""they are to be exported from France by Dassault"" and ""HAL or anyone else cannot be the production agency for the simple reason that no aircraft are to be produced in India.""  He said HAL was a nominated production agency for the 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) program, which never reached the contract stage.  ""Reliance Defence or any other Reliance group company has not received any contract from the MoD till date, related to 36 Rafale aircraft. This is absolutely unfounded and incorrect,"" he told over phone.  Opposition Congress party last week demanded a JPC in the deal and its president Rahul Gandhi has been attacking the government for inking the deal at a much higher price than the one the previous UPA regime had negotiated. He has accused the government of changing the deal to benefit ""one businessman"".  On allegations of the firm getting the contract because of Ambani's reported proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said: ""As per Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), the Ministry of Defence has no role in the selection of Indian partners by the foreign vendors. This has been the position right from 2005 when offsets were first introduced in the country.""  In the more than 50 offset (export obligations) contracts signed in the country till date, the same process has been followed, he said. ""Therefore, this is a deliberate attempt to mislead people and cloud the issue."" On the issue lack of experience in making fighter aircraft, Dhingra said no company in India, except HAL, has the experience of making fighter planes. ""This would mean that we will never create any new capability beyond what exists and will continue to import more than 70 per cent of our defence hardware,"" he said.  Dhingra added that Reliance will be participating in the offset program through Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) in which Dassault holds a 49 per cent stake bringing in its 90 years of aerospace manufacturing experience, making it the ""most qualified vendor"".  He said the allegation of Reliance benefiting with a Rs 30,000 crore contract was ""absolutely wrong"" , saying ""Dassault's share of offsets is about 25 per cent, with the remaining offset obligations being shared by Thales, Safran, MBDA and others.""  ""Therefore, the basic premise of Dassault giving Rs 30,000 crore worth of offset contracts to Reliance is totally unfounded,"" he said, adding Dassault and its other Tier-I suppliers have already indicated more than 100 Indian companies which will participate in the offset contracts. This includes joint ventures with PSUs like HAL and BEL.  ""We can also not lose sight of the fact that up to 30 per cent of total offsets can be discharged through transfer of technology to DRDO, as per DPP,"" he said.  Asked about Reliance Defence being incorporated days before announcement of the Rafale deal, he said three companies were incorporated in December 2014 and Reliance Group's entry into defence sector was announced at Aero India in February 2015. ""Also there are reports in the media of as late as end-March 2015 where Dassault officials were on record to say that the MMRCA deal is 95 per cent done. If this is correct, what is the linkage with the date of incorporation of Reliance Defence?"" he asked.  The deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets was signed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited France in April 2015.  On the question of presence of Ambani at the time of announcement of the deal by the Prime Minister, Dhingra said Anil Ambani is part of the CEOs' Forum for France and also many other countries.  ""He was in Paris because there was a meeting of the CEOs' Forum on the sidelines of the Prime Minister's visit. More than 25 other CEOs from the Indian companies were also present, including the Chairman of HAL,"" he said.  Offset obligations are to be discharged during September 2019 to September 2023, as per the contract.  Asked about allegations that Reliance actually got contracts worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore and not Rs 30,000 crore, he said the amount may be coming from projections of Rs 30,000 crore for offsets and another Rs 100,000 crore towards the lifecycle cost over 50 years.  ""There cannot be anything further from truth... To the best of my knowledge, the government has not signed any lifecycle contract for 50 years with Dassault. Therefore, the very question of Reliance getting a contract does not arise,"" he said.  On the issue of Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman denying knowledge of the contract, he said as per DPP 2016, the foreign vendor has a choice to submit the details of its offset partners at the time of claiming offset credits.  ""In this case, offset obligations are due only after September 2019. It is, therefore, possible that the Ministry of Defence has no formal communication from Dassault Aviation about the choice of its partners for the offsets,"" he said.  Asked if it was correct that under DPP a joint secretary-level official is required to countersign the contract, he said: ""The offset contract is signed between the MoD and the foreign vendor. MoD does not sign any contract with the Indian offset partners.""",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/reliance-says-rafale-contract-received-from-dassault-not-defence-ministry/articleshow/65373059.cms
2018-08-12,"Reliance Jio is poised to launch a mass-market, high-speed, wired, broadband service bundled with internet-based television programming starting at about Rs 500 a month, or effectively half of what cable operators charge for similar services.The Mukesh Ambani-controlled telco is looking at a commercial rollout of Jio GigaFiber before Diwali (November 7), initially in the metros and about 80 top tier 1and 2 markets, a person with knowledge of the plan told ET. Availability of the service will depend on the volume of consumer registrations starting August 15, the person said.At present, cable operators offer home broadband packs – over 100 GB of data at 100 Mbps speed – at Rs 700-1,000 a month per household and charge an additional Rs 250-300 per home for TV services. Jio’s pricing for a similar bundled offer would be about 50% lower as it focuses on volumes to drive demand.Analysts estimate the company’s home broadband pricing to be at a 25-30% discount to current 4G mobile data rates. Jio’s home broadband pricing would be “much more affordable and well below the current 4G mobile data rates that are in Rs 2.7-5 per GB range,” said Rajiv Sharma, HSBC director and telecom analyst. According to Naveen Kulkarni, telecom analyst at PhillipCapital, Jio’s home broadband bundled with TV services won’t affect its own 4G mobile data business.“There can be very limited cannibalisation even if Jio prices fixed broadband (with bundled internet TV services) at 30% below 4G mobile broadband rates as the two data products are very different – one meant for the home user and the other for the person on-the move. Also, the quality of video streaming in a fibre-based home broadband scenario would be far more reliable and consistent than 4G mobile broadband,” Kulkarni said.At press time, Jio did not reply to ET’s queries. Hetal Gandhi, director (research) and telecom expert at Crisil Ltd, expects “bundled services to emerge as the key differentiator and start gaining importance among operators as they seek to improve stickiness and gain market share.” She said Verizon in the US and Vodafone Plc in the UK rely on bundled offerings to retain subscribers and gain market share and have moved towards offering quad-play bundles – typically when consumers buy a combination of landline, internet, television and mobile services from a single company.Another person said Jio may deploy IP multicasting technology to offer internet-based TV services so that home broadband customers don’t use up their data for television. The technology allows a single stream of TV services to be delivered to a group of recipients. HSBC’s Sharma said IP multicasting makes sense because “without such a technology, Jio would have had to provide each home a data allowance of over 500-600 GB per month for delivering TV services alone, which would limit the company’s ability to price home broadband with bundled TV services at an attractive Rs 500 per month.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/happy-hours-reliance-jio-to-disrupt-broadband-market-with-low-pricing/articleshow/65379041.cms

The RCom stock was up 2.3% at Rs19.94 on the BSE at midday trade Monday.""RCOM and its subsidiary, Reliance Telecom Limited, have today reinstated bank guarantees aggregating Rs. 774 crore with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), four weeks ahead of the last date of 10th Sep 2018 as granted by the Hon’ble Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT),"" said the telco in a regulatory filing on Monday. ""The reinstatement of the BGs ensures that RCom’s license and spectrum value of Rs. 11,300 crore stands fully protected, and RCom is fully compliant with the guidelines of NIA 2013 and NIA 2015,"" the telco added.

RCom expects to raise Rs 18,000 crore from sales of wireless assets to Jio and real estate assets to Canada’s Brookfield, and reduce its Rs 46,000 crore debt by repaying lenders.It will sell an additional around 65 MHz spectrum in the 800 MHz band to Jio for around Rs3,500-Rs3,700 crore which will help in bringing down the telco's debt further.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-replenishes-bank-guarantees-to-dot/articleshow/65384063.cms
2018-08-13,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm will invest Rs 1,000 crore in a state-of-the-art greenfield data centre in Kolkata’s upcoming 100-acre IT hub that will be the biggest in the state, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday.She was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the upcoming Bengal Silicon Valley tech hub.People familiar with the matter said Jio has already put in an application to the state government for 40 acres of prime land on long-term lease basis for setting up the proposed data centre at the upcoming tech hub in the city’s eastern fringes.Jio’s eastern India head Tarun Jhunjhunwala, who attended the stone-laying ceremony of Bengal Silicon Valley, said, “The data centre project is a reaffirmation of Reliance’s faith in Bengal, and it will be our contribution towards state chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s goal of digitising West Bengal.”An email ET sent to Jio, seeking details such as investment size, land acquisition plans and potential number of jobs the call centre would create, did not get a reply as of press time Monday.Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani had during the recent Bengal Global Business Summit committed to set up a data centre in the state.Back in January, Ambani had reportedly said RIL would invest as much as Rs 5,000 crore in West Bengal to bolster the telecom arm’s operations, its digital ecosystem as well as the group’s retail and fuel retail businesses.RIL, he had reportedly said, would also be working with multiple partners to explore the setting up of state-of-the-art, next-gen electronics manufacturing facilities to make West Bengal an innovation hub for consumer devices such as mobile phones and set-top boxes.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-to-set-up-rs-1000-crore-data-centre-in-kolkata/articleshow/65391067.cms

2018-08-14,"NEW DELHI: As the Nifty50 index ended in the red on Monday, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled downward crossovers for 117 stocks on NSE.MACD is known for identifying trend reversals.Among the stocks that saw bearish crossovers were Punjab National Bank, IndianOil, India Cements, Bank of India, Andhra Bank, Hindustan Petroleum, Cadila Healthcare, Reliance Industries and Allahabad Bank.Some of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.Other stocks that saw downward crossovers included Bharat Petroleum, L&T Finance Holdings, Tata Power, Indian Bank, IL&FS Transportation, Bharat Forge, Bajaj Electricals, Indiabulls Housing Finance, NCL Industries and Rashtriya Chemicals.MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.When MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward movement, and vice-versa.However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call. Traders should also make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any trend.Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.Meanwhile, MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers on 10 counters on NSE, giving ‘buy’ signals.They included Infosys, Just Dial, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Next Mediaworks, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance and L&T Technology Services.Domestic stocks ended lower for the second straight session on Monday, dragged down by industry heavyweights such as RIL, HDFC twins, SBI, YES Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank.The rupee hit an all-time low of 69.93 against the US dollar, as heavy selloff in global currencies, including the Turkish lira, fuelled demand for safe haven assets.The Nifty50 pack dropped 73.75 points, or 0.65 per cent, to settle at 11,356, with 19 constituents ending in the green and 31 in the red.During the process, the index formed a Falling Window pattern, meaning a downside gap on the charts. A Falling Window implies that the weakness might persist in the next session, though it would require a confirmation, said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist-Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said: “This selloff resulted in the breach of a critical support available in the form of nine-day EMA, which offered support to the Nifty50 during corrections in this leg of the upward move from the low of 10,550, suggesting the possibility of significant weakness going forward.”Understanding MACDA closer look at the chart of Infosys shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice-versa.

2018-08-14,"Macro situation has worsened in last few weeks and it is better to continue in quality stocks and IT names, Sanjeev Prasad, Senior Executive Director and Co-       head, Kotak Institutional Equities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:It has been quite a satisfactory August for Indian markets. Six weeks ago, markets were worried about trade war, crude and general rich valuations. But given where we were versus where we are right now, it has been quite a makeover, a big mood change.Well I guess so. We still have all the macro issues though I guess the market is willing to overlook some of them. It looks like the situation is that of a frog in a pan of boiling water. The water is boiling but the frog probably does not feel that the water is getting hotter till the last moment. We will see how it goes from here.When you say frog in boiling water, are you referring to what is happening in Turkey or other emerging markets? What are you trying to imply?Lots of things. The global microeconomic situation is not very good. On one side, there is the US-China trade conflict escalating day by day and if US actually imposes tariffs on the next $200 billion of imports from China, that is definitely going to destabilise Chinese economy to some extent. Already you are seeing some macro challenges there. Then, there is the second issue of oil and US sanctions against Iran as far as oil goes into play from November 5.th Given that Iran is such a huge exporter of oil, if even half of that goes out, then it will be a real challenge as far as global supply situation is concerned. There is no way other countries will be able to increase production so quickly. So, there is a greater chance of oil prices going up higher still. It is not as if the macro environment has improved over the last three-four weeks. If anything, it has deteriorated from where we were about three-four weeks back.Are you scaling up on IT and pharma primarily because of what is happening with the currency because for the near and foreseeable future, the currency trading weaker rather than stronger?Again, you have to look at every stock not just depend on some programmed trade. You have to look at everything on the bottom and based on that see whether the price value creation makes sense or not. This holds across every sector, every stock. I am not running a programme which says if macro is bad, just go and buy some IT and pharma; macro is good, buy corporate banks or metal and mining stocks.What else do you do as an investor in the market when things start getting wobbly. We can already feel the heat when it comes to emerging market currencies. As an investor, do you stick with that quality paper, the HDFC Banks, Kotak Banks or do you look at some of the contrarian pockets? Do you bet on cyclicals or not?That has been the trade anyway for the last 8-12 months. It is only the quality stocks which have been performing. If I look at the year to date performance of Nifty, the entire performance has probably come from 10 stocks. Reliance, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Hindustan Lever, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd, the standard quality growth names are the ones which are performing. So, yes, you continue with that trade. If you have macro issues, probably people will need to hide in the high quality growth stocks or in the IT names and that has been the trade for the last seven-eight months. If you look at year to date basis, some of the reasons why the Nifty has actually performed so well is also the fact that the rupee had depreciated significantly which resulted in IT sector actually being a big driver of the whole market performance.The Nifty 50 index performance over the last 7-7.5 months on a current year to date basis shows, it has gone up roughly 8% on in rupee terms, but in dollar terms it is pretty much flat given the fact that the rupee had depreciated so much. It is not as if this market is doing very well. If you extend it beyond the top 20-30 names, then the market is actually performing horribly. If you look at the BSE Midcap Index, it is down around 9% in rupee term and 15-16% in dollar terms. If you can look at the BSE Smallcap Index, it is down about 12-13% in rupee terms and 20% in dollar terms. It is not as if this market has made a lot of money for investors.But is it time then to bet on the underperformers a Bank of Baroda (BOB) or SBI or for that matter even ICICI Bank? It seems that we are nearing the end of that NPA crisis. Some of these PSBs and corporate banks are in for a re-rating maybe two-three quarters down the line?I would agree with that. Our view is that the NPL cycle, at least the large corporate loan book NPL, is largely over, at least it has peaked. We are starting to see some resolutions moving ahead. Provisions have reached a reasonable level and one can expect the loan loss provision numbers to start declining incrementally. If that is the case, then in next two-three quarters, we should start seeing the financials as far as the P&L are concerned in terms of ROA and ROE also starting to move in the right direction.That is when you could see some of the stocks getting rerated. In last one month, some of the corporate banks have given pretty handsome returns. So yes, there is value out there. Of course, if you have a situation where the macro deteriorates significantly from where we are, how the Iran-US situation pans out, that will be a big risk out there. If oil prices go up higher, then probably the stock may not perform. But over the next three-four quarters, if you have a slightly longer term view, then there is clearly value out here.Did the promise of Reliance moving from an old economy company to a telecom company and now perhaps towards big data and artificial intelligence, lead to a linear move in the stock after the AGM? Should one believe the proposition Mr Ambani tabled on the AGM?It certainly has the ingredients. Reliance has about roughly $4 billion of free cash flow generation from the petrochemical and refining business every year so that can support a lot of investment in the new areas. It has already got about 200 million subscribers which is probably go to about 400 million in two, three years time as far as telecom subscribers are concerned. It also has got a fair amount of media content company that has also got the back-end supply chain as far as the whole organised retailing business is concerned. Can the company put everything together, given the fact that it does have great execution capabilities? There are the cash flows which the traditional business is throwing and with some amount of logistics, backend supply chain is already available. In a way, you have a company which can be the equivalent of some sort of technology platform company doing e-commerce and also offering entertainment. Maybe, it is a combination of Amazon plus Netflix going forward. The question is how much do you want to pay for that kind of a model in two to five years’ timeframe? Should you pay everything today or you wait and see how the execution plays out?Between ICICI Bank and Reliance, which is a better buy? They both have different kind of propositions; one has the promise of cyclical turn and the other one has a promise of free cash flow generation and an option value which will come from its IT/tech business?You would probably make money in both in a 3-5-year timeframe. I am ultimately interested in looking at stocks on a slightly longer term timeframe. Over the next one year, you would probably make more money in ICICI Bank assuming this whole NPL issue is largely behind it and hopefully that is the case. Reliance to some extent is already discounting some of the option value out there. If I do a conventional sum of the parts valuation of the company, then it is hard to get to beyond 1000-1050, on just a pure bottom sum of the part basis. In a way, the market is already giving almost one lakh crore of valuation for some of the optionality out there. May be in a shorter term timeframe, ICICI could be a better bet compared to Reliance but longer term, I am prepared to hold both the names.Do you find value in OMCs given what has happened with oil prices and if in the foreseeable future oil prices remain in a range where 80 becomes a ceiling, are you in the camp that sees value in OMCs because they have fallen so much over the last three months?There is value, surely, but I do not know what call should I take on oil given this whole overhang of Iran-US issue and what kind of sanctions come into play on Iran.Specifically as far as oil industry is concerned, it is very hard to take a call on that. If it is very hard sanctions in the form of absolutely no exports in the sense that any country which imports oil from Iran also faces some form of sanctions from US and if any financial institution which is doing business with Iran, faces sanctions then it is a very terrible situation as far as global oil prices are concerned. Oil prices are going to shoot up dramatically in that case. If that is the scenario, then I am not a buyer of oil companies. I would rather wait and see how this whole sanction issue plays out. If it is a mild form of sanctions, say half a million barrels per day gets affected, then that can be made up by other countries like Saudi Arabia etc. But anything beyond a million barrels per day becomes very hard for the other OPEC countries to balance.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/in-next-1-year-icici-bank-can-make-more-money-than-reliance-sanjeev-prasad-kotak-institutional-equities/articleshow/65396949.cms
2018-08-14,"Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio has started the registration process for its GigaFiber broadband services. The fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service is pitched as an all-in-one solution offering a host of services including broadband, IPTV, landline, virtual reality gaming and more.Do note that the registration is merely an expression of interest for the services. The company had earlier clarified that it will priortise the localities and cities from where it received the maximum registrations. Also, Reliance Jio is expected to roll out the services by Diwali this year. About 80 top tier 1and 2 markets are likely to get the services first.The company is expected to offer GigaFiber services at very cheap prices - about Rs 500 a month, or effectively half of what cable operators charge for similar services. At present, cable operators offer home broadband packs – over 100 GB of data at 100 Mbps speed – at Rs 700-1,000 a month per household and charge an additional Rs 250-300 per home for TV services. Jio’s pricing for a similar bundled offer would be about 50% lower as it focuses on volumes to drive demand. To register your interest for GigaFiber, go to visit MyJio app or Jio.com. There you will be prompted to enter some details like your name and address. Note that registration is free of cost.Subscribers are expected to get a router and a set top box called JioGigaTV. According to Jio, these devices can be controlled through the MyJio app. Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, while announcing the launch of 4G services in September, had said that FTTH service will push the power of data even further, and will offer data speeds up to 1 Gigabit per second.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/reliance-jio-gigafiber-registration-starts-tomorrow-heres-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/65397316.cms

Mumbai- based Reliance Entertainment Group consists of 23 entities with a wide-ranging portfolio across the diverse verticals like internet and new media, gaming, film and television entertainment and broadcasting.This diverse business interest of the group doesn’t help Peerzade’s cause. But he is unflinching in his commitment to use IT for creating an enduring competitive advantage for Reliance Big Entertainment.In an interview with ETCIO.COM, Sayed Peerzaade, Group CIO, Reliance Big Entertainment gives a glimpse into the IT roadmap of the company.As a multimedia company what is the most critical business challenge Reliance Big Entertainment is faced with?We are the media and entertainment arm of Reliance Group and is engaged in the creation and distribution of content across film, television, new media, digital and gaming platforms. So as a creative company we are into content creation.Our biggest business challenge as an entertainment company is engaging the customer. We have to build competitive differentiation in two ways- one is to create compelling content and second is to serve it an engaging way on digital platforms. Technology comes into picture when we have to serve our content to the users and provide an interactive and immersive experience to them.As the Group CIO orchestrating technology deployments across 23 entities of Reliance Big Entertainment what are IT initiatives you are driving?We have been the early adopters of several emerging technologies like cloud and analytics. We turned around our business by bringing those innovations at the right time, in the right way.Digital transformation is a never-ending journey, you just can’t stop by adapting SMAC technologies. Fundamentally you need to keep building on them. That’s the crux of our digital strategy. There are several transformations that we have brought over and above the basic SMAC stack that we built a couple of years back.You were one of the early adoptors of the cloud model and realized significant savings by going down cloud route. How are you advancing the cloud journey?In the initial stage, we adopted a private cloud on VMware platform. Now we have moved that set up to OpenStack. The reason behind the move to OpenStack is to take advantage of newly available technologies and these developments bring more flexibility to the system. We saw significant cost reduction with this move. We will use this savings to make investments in other new technologies that we intend to deploy.Apart from the private cloud that we built 3-4 years, we are also aggressively using the public cloud. Today, nearly 60 percent of my workloads are on the private cloud and the remaining 40 percent on the public cloud. So we are truly Hybrid. Our decision to adapt these technologies resulted in huge benefit, we have much better in product time to market. We don’t have to bother with the dynamic usage of infrastructure. It also enhanced the user experience in a big way.You are also planning to migrate your ERP to the cloud. Talk to us about the rationale behind the move.One of the recent significant decisions we have taken in terms of technology is ERP enhancement. In a couple of months, we will go live with ERP on a private cloud. There are two ways in which we are enhancing our ERP. We are migrating our ERP from ECC to S4 HANA and at the same time, we are moving our ERP from traditional datacenter to private cloud. So other than putting our ERP on the cloud we are doing an enhancement of the ERP as well at the same time.It’s a huge and challenging project considering the sensitivity of data involved. The ERP is used by all the 23 Reliance Big Entertainment Group entities so the migration should be planned and executed very methodically. We believe this initiative will bring more agility to business.Since we last spoke, you have moved way forward in your analytics journey. You are now working towards developing a Live analytics platform? We adopted analytics in 2012-13. Back in those days, we did not find an end to end service providers because it was still early days for analytics.After conceptualizing and creating our own Analytical ecosystem, which was deferred analytics to the extent of 4-6 hrs, we are now working on a project to create a live analytics platform. Our new approach is Cloud native. However, engagement products we developed and build around out analytical ecosystem will always remain in-house. Our live analytics platform will go live in a month or so. We are experimenting and working with many technologies like Max Compute, Hadoop, Cloudera, etc to finalize the solution.As a content creation company Reliance Big Entertainment deals with vast swathes of data. This poses a challenge to the deployment of a live analytics platform. How are you using technology to deal with the issue?The volume of data is huge for us. We insert 65 million rows per day in our database. This is where the challenge is. We need proper planning to establish a robust system which not only collects data at speed, process and gives complete real-time data insights.Speaking more on the technology aspect, we want to keep it very simple. In brief, the basic building blocks start from a collection of data, you can use serverless computing services like Log service of Memory channel, then data will be moved to Distributed storage, either Hadoop or Max compute, where we can use Tableau or any other visualization tool.Data is used for Statistical analysis– such as dashboarding, custom analytics, game operations, communication etc.Data is used for statistical analysis with the help of R, or Data Science studio for Both descriptive and prescriptive analytics.How are you leveraging Artificial Intelligence?We have major plans to build AI & ML capabilities over the data we have collected from last 4-5 years. We will use that data to build algorithms and make the system more automated. The objective is to use the data meaningfully and enhance the user engagement.The challenges in adapting and building AI ecosystem is the costs, talent crunch, and manual workflow. We are working on all three aspects to build the best of solutions, which not only cost effective also more of less dependency on manual aspects. Cloud plays a very significant part here.We are thinking of building AI capabilities both at client and server end. Online games work on two engines- one is the client game engine that sits at the customer level and the other is the backend engine which works at the customer level( the customer, in this case, is a device like a mobile or tab). Both of these go hand in hand. The idea is to build AI capabilities on both the client and server side. This will enable more user engagement and product enhancement.Augmented Reality has a significant impact on your gaming business. How do you plan to use this technology?The latest game that we have developed is WWE. We have seen more than 10 million downloads so far.We are the first in the industry to bring Augmented Reality into such mobile games. So any user playing our game can take a photograph of the WWE toy (Mattel) character and that character can be embodied by the user with the help of AR.And based on how he plays, the AI engine we build will understand his behavior and enhance the user experience more by learning the movements and play pattern of the player. More the user engagement, more the time users spent on the product.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/how-group-cio-sayed-peerzade-leverages-it-to-help-reliance-big-entertainment-step-up-its-game/articleshow/65401952.cms
2018-08-14,"Reliance Industries and its partner BP plc of UK have spent over Rs 7,000 crore in prolonging output from the flagging D1 and D3 gas fields in the Bay of Bengal as they prepare new fields that will start production in mid-2020, sources in the consortium said. In perhaps one of its kind intervention in a deepsea field, RIL-BP has, through the use of a combination of complex techniques, kept the wells flowing at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 & D3) gas fields in the Krishna Godavari basin block KG-D6, they said. RIL-BP want to keep the system live till the R-Series and Satellite fields in KG-D6 block are ready to produce. The due plan to use existing facilities to produce 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of peak output from R-Series, Satellite, and MJ fields. The D1 and D3 fields, the first of the one-and-a-half dozen gas discoveries in KG-D6 that were brought to production in April 2009, will cease to produce by end-2019. This shutdown will coincide with upgradation, modification, and preparation of facilities and operating system to connect new fields, sources said adding the R-Series is likely to give first gas in mid-2020 while Satellite and MJ field may begin output in 2021 and 2022. The partners, they said, have spent over Rs 7000 crore in sustaining production from D1&D3 fields, which otherwise would have ceased to produce much earlier. D1&D3 witnessed higher than anticipated and sooner than expected sand and water ingress that led to choking of wells after wells since the second half of 2010. D1&D3 are at the tail-end of their production life and they are being kept alive to preserve the facility for use by the new production from the three projects, sources said. Besides costing money to first preserve the facilities in case of an early shut-down and later reuse it, a shutdown could have created problems as the system would be idle for too long in the deepwater, they said adding inlet pressure has been delicately reduced to levels where multiple wells could be kept flowing. Besides, surfactant is being used to lift water from the wells and gas from MA field is being recirculated to keep the line packed and help lift the gas from the remaining fields. This, they said, can last for only another year -- at which point the quantity of gas will be so low, water production will be beyond what the system can manage, and the pressure will be depleted that no more gas can be produced. Reliance had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009. MA field cessation expected by September 2018, sources said, adding that the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010. Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter. MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 & D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd. Output thereafter has only declined. KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 & D3 and MA fields. RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent. RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012. The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum of 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-bp-spend-rs-7000-cr-to-prolong-output-from-d1-d3-fields-in-kg-d6-block/articleshow/65402814.cms

2018-08-17,"MUMBAI: The Supreme Court Friday stayed the telecom tribunal’s order that upheld a clause in the spectrum trading guidelines, which, if enforced, would have meant Reliance Communications may have needed to pay nearly Rs 4000 crore to the government as bandwidth related fees for its airwave sale to Reliance Jio to be cleared.The issue started when RCom moved Telecom Disputes Settlements and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) with the petition to quash clause 8 of telecom department’s spectrum trading guideline. The clause states that an operator who wants to trade its spectrum bought in the 2013 auction has to pay the difference in that price and the latest auction price.The clause 8 stated, “trading of spectrum shall be permitted only if the differential of the latest auction price and the March 2013 auction price on pro-rata basis on the balance period of right to use the spectrum is paid”.For RCom, the latest ruling is important since it is trading 800 MHz airwave to Jio as part of its asset monetization process and for the sale to be cleared by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), it would have had to pay around Rs 4000 crore. Those airwaves had come into RCom’s kitty when the Anil Ambani owned telco bought Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL) in a share swap deal in 2017.RCom shares ended 3.5% higher at Rs19.18 on the BSE Friday.SSTL had acquired those 800 MHz airwaves in eight out of 22 circles in the auctions of 2013. Post its merger with RCom, the assets and liabilities of SSTL, including the licenses and spectrum held by SSTL, were transferred to the Anil Ambani-owned telco.RCom had filed a case in the TDSAT alleging that DoT was attempting to extort the money from the operator as a condition for allowing trading of its spectrum acquired through auction in March 2013. After the tribunal ruled in DoT’s favour on August 3, the company moved apex court.On Friday, the SC issued a notice to DoT and stayed TDSAT’s previous order.Rcom expects to raise some Rs 18,000 crore by selling the wireless assets to Jio and real estate assets to Canada’s Brookfield, and reduce its Rs46,000 crore-debt by repaying its 39 lenders.A week ago, it said it will sell an additional around 65 MHz spectrum in the 800 MHz band to Jio for around Rs3,500-Rs3,700 crore which will help in bringing down the Anil Ambani-owned telco's debt further.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/sc-stays-tdsat-order-upholding-key-spectrum-trading-clause-relief-to-reliance-communications/articleshow/65440862.cms
2018-08-18,"MUMBAI/BENGALURU: Chinese internet and e-commerce giant Alibaba has revived talks with influential Indian conglomerates to boost its omni-channel or multi-channel retailing plans in the world’s sixth largest economy. Senior executives from Alibaba have held discussions with the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL), Tata Group and Kishore Biyani’s Future Retail in recent months in a bid to accelerate their India push, people familiar with the matter said.While Alibaba’s discussions with RIL is new, it had held talks with Noel Tata, chairman of Trent, and Cyrus Mistry, the former chairman of Tata Group. RIL, Tata and Future have significant retailing footprint, something which could bolster Alibaba’s omni-channel blueprint in the country. Omni-channel or multi-channel retailing provides shoppers with a consistent and seamless buying experience across online and offline stores. Alibaba has popularised this approach as ‘online-to-offline’ (O2O) model in its home country, China, especially to on-board offline users who might not be making purchases through online platforms. “Some of these talks are tentative and may not even progress,” said one of the people cited earlier in the report. The talks revolved around a possible joint venture or a broader synergistic alliance with Alibaba picking up a stake in the retail entities of any of the large Indian groups. A few days ago, Biyani said that he could close a deal with a foreign investor in the next couple of months. He, however, didn’t reveal the name of the potential alliance partner. It’s reported that Alibaba’s American rival Amazon has held talks with Biyani to acquire a stake in Future Retail. RIL and Tata didn’t respond to queries from this newspaper, while an emailed questionnaire to Alibaba remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Biyani said he hasn’t had any discussions with Alibaba.A second person said Alibaba has drawn up a list of possible partners that goes beyond the three earlier-mentioned conglomerates, while adding that a partner could be identified in the “next few months”. There is speculation that Alibaba, along with Goldman Sachs, could be part of a consortium that Samara Capital is putting together to acquire More supermarkets from the Aditya Birla Group. Alibaba is hastening plans in India following Walmart’s $16-billion acquisition of Flipkart and Amazon’s rapid strides backed by $5-billion investments.Alibaba, which clocked profits of $10 billion on revenues of nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2017-18, holds significant stake in Paytm Mall, which has made sedate progress in a fiercely competitive market. Despite the backing of Alibaba and SoftBank, Paytm Mall clocks about one lakh daily shipments, which is much less than Amazon and Flipkart that are doing about four lakh daily shipments. Alibaba has pushed the Noida-based company to approach the market with an O2O model, unlike other existing players who largely rely on a mix of inventory and marketplace model in India. Besides Paytm Mall, Alibaba holds stakes in BigBasket, Zomato and TicketNew. It plans to bring these investments into the proposed new partnership to tap synergies, the people added. RIL runs Reliance Retail, which in turn has a plethora of businesses and is working on its own omni-channel strategy in tandem with Reliance Jio. While Alibaba is impressed by RIL’s ambitious plans, it is unclear if India’s most-valued company would want to induct a foreign partner right now.Ambani had said that the biggest growth opportunity for RIL’s consumer-facing business is in creating a “hybrid, online-to-offline commerce platform”. The retail unit has 7,500 physical stores in India across categories ranging from clothing to grocery to electronics. Like RIL, it is unclear whether Tata is ready to bring in an overseas partner in its retail business. Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran is focused on scaling up and integrating the physical and digital retail platforms. The conglomerate’s retail is spread across Titan, Trent (Star Bazaar), Infiniti Retail (Croma) and Tata Unistore (CLiQ), among other companies.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/alibaba-eyes-joint-venture-with-big-indian-companies-in-talks-with-ril-tatas-future-retail/articleshow/65448432.cms

2018-08-20,"Reliance Group today said its Chairman Anil Ambani has written to Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale fighter jet deal saying his party has been ""misinformed, misdirected and misled"" by ""malicious vested interests and corporate rivals"" on the issue. Ambani, who had first written to Gandhi on the issue in December, last week again wrote to him saying not a single component worth a single rupee is to be manufactured by his group for the 36 Rafale jets India is buying from France, the company said in a statement here. Gandhi has been attacking the government for inking the deal at a much higher price than the one the previous UPA regime had negotiated. While he has accused the government of changing the deal to benefit ""one businessman"", his party has demanded a JPC probe into the deal. ""Allegations of Reliance benefitting by thousands of crores is a figment of imagination, promoted by vested interests,"" the company statement said, quoting from Ambani's letter. ""Simply put, no contract exists with the Government of India."" French company Dassault, which is supplying the fighter jets, has entered into a joint venture with Reliance Group to meet its offset requirement of the contract. Under defence offset, a foreign supplier of equipment agrees to manufacture a given percent of his product (in terms of value) in the buying country. Sometimes this may take place with technology transfer. While direct offsets are linked to the original defence contact where companies often agree to transfer relevant technological know-how or use local suppliers to build the equipment they are selling to the government, indirect offsets have nothing to do with the deal and can include the company making up investments in local industries. In case of Rafale deal, which will give new comer Reliance Group a foothold in the defence industry, the companies have not specified what components will they manufacturer in India. Ambani in the letter expressed ""deep anguish over continued personal attacks by Rahul Gandhi on him"", the statement said. He termed all allegations as ""baseless, ill-informed and unfortunate"" Explaining the role of Reliance in offset exports/ work share with Dassault, he said: ""The Congress has been misinformed, misdirected and misled by malicious vested interests and corporate rivals."" He said Rafale fighter jets are not being manufactured by Reliance of the Dassault Reliance joint venture. ""All 36 planes are to be 100 per cent manufactured in France, and exported from France to India."" ""There is no contract from the Ministry of Defence to any Reliance Group company related to 36 Rafale aircraft,"" the statement said. Ambani said his group's ""role is limited to offset/ export obligations. More than 100 medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) will participate in this, along with public sector undertakings like BEL and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). ""This role strengthens Indian manufacturing capabilities, and is in pursuance of the Offsets Policy introduced by the Congress-led UPA government itself from 2005 onwards."" He said Reliance Group announced its decision to enter the defence manufacturing sector in December 2014-January 2015, ""months before the intention for the purchase of Rafale aircraft"".",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/reliance-wont-make-a-single-component-worth-a-single-rupee-for-rafale-jets-anil-ambani/articleshow/65475879.cms

2018-08-22,"Claims and counterclaims are flying thick and fast over India’s deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter aircraft as the Congress-led opposition is relentlessly raising questions over the financial terms of the agreement and alleging crony capitalism while the government is rubbishing the accusations.A closer look is in order to establish whether there is any merit in the opposition’s charges that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government ended up paying a lot more for the French manufactured jets than the price which was being negotiated by its predecessor, and that Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence will be a key financial beneficiary at the expense of the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).The NDA government, in April 2015, announced the deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf, about three years after the then Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government had selected Rafale for purchase from among competing aircraft. However, the UPA government had planned to buy 126 fighter jets, 108 of which were to be made in India by HAL.Therefore, the NDA government has argued that the final deal with Dassault Aviation, which manufactures Rafale fighter jets, is not comparable with the UPA’s original negotiations. It has also dismissed the charge of favouring a private company over HAL, saying the government had no say in Dassault Aviation in choosing to partner Reliance Defence to meet its offset or export obligations.IS INDIA PAYING TOO MUCH?The Congress has maintained that the government bought the jets at an inflated price of 7.87 billion euros (about Rs 59,000 crore). Congress president Rahul Gandhi had alleged in a tweet in March that the NDA government paid Rs 1,670 crore per aircraft while the UPA government had negotiated a price of Rs 570 crore. However, the defence ministry’s internal calculations, accessed by ET, show that each Rafale jet works out Rs 59 crore cheaper than what it would have cost under the UPA deal.The notes state that with the India specific enhancements, under the UPA’s terms the Rafale jets would have cost Rs 1,705 crore per jet, compared with the Rs 1,646 crore the NDA government negotiated for the purchase of 36 combat aircraft. A big component of the cost is attributed to India-specific enhancements to the jets, from the ability to take off from high-altitude stations such as Leh to an enhanced infrared search and track sensor and a potent electronic jammer pod. The cost of these enhancements has been taken as standard – they will cost the same for 36 jets as they would for 126 – since these are one-time research and development costs.Given the complexity of the deal, the Congress could argue that the 36 jets should have been way cheaper since they were being bought off the shelf. The government, on its part, says that not only are the jets negotiated by it cheaper but also armed with cutting-edge weapons and more efficient with a performance guarantee clause.Will Reliance Defence Gain at HAL’s Expense?The Congress has alleged that the deal “gifted” offsets to the tune of 3.9 billion euros to Reliance Defence, which has no experience of making jets or defence equipment, inflicting massive losses on HAL. As per the UPA deal, the jets were to be made in India by HAL. Since this was never finalised and subsequently cancelled by the NDA government, an offset clause kicked in for the direct, off-the-shelf purchase. The clause mandated that French companies invest at least 50% of the contract value in projects or work given to Indian entities. Offsets are designed to help nurture local manufacturers to absorb global technology and imbibe best practices and technology to be able to compete with the world’s top companies.So, What’s the Real Deal?The offset clause kicks in only three years after signing of the contract. This means, the French companies will have to deliver on offsets from October 2019. The government, therefore, is making a technical argument that no offset contracts have been approved, simply because the work is to start next year and Dassault Aviation would be obligated to take permissions from the defence ministry to approve its Indian partners only then. However, there is little doubt that the Dassault Reliance Aviation Ltd (DRAL) joint venture has been acknowledged and supported by both the Indian and French governments. In October 2017, French defence minister Florence Parly, India’s road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis were present at the inauguration of DRAL’s first facility in Nagpur. The government’s point is that the Congress could not seal the deal when it was in power because Dassault Aviation and HAL could not strike a deal. The talks to make the jets in India broke down irreparably in 2012-14. The only way to have bought the Rafale jets after this impasse was to cancel the old deal and negotiate afresh. That HAL was the casualty in this reworked deal is clear.Unanswered QuestionsAmid the raging debate over pricing and offsets deal, a number of questions are yet to be fully answered. Will the Jets be Delivered Earlier? The government has claimed that it struck a deal for buying the fighters off the shelf – at the cost of sacrificing the Make in India concept – so as to get quicker delivery of the aircraft and secure the country’s defence. However, the 36 Rafale jets are to be delivered within 67 months of the signing that took place in October 2016. The first of these jets will not arrive before October 2019. The time frame is similar to the delivery schedule under the UPA-negotiated deal, which envisaged getting 18 jets off the shelf. Internal documents show that the government’s assessment is that it saved “five months” in the delivery schedule with its off the-shelf purchase. Given that not a single jet is being made in India, this does not amount to a significant saving on delivery time.Can Sovereign Guarantee Replace Bank Guarantee?In the Rafale deal, the French negotiated a mechanism as per which its government would act as guarantor. This was a departure from regular commercial purchases, where the winning company is required by law to furnish guarantees from an international bank that can be encashed by the purchaser in case deliveries are not made on time after payments have been made. There was significant discomfort on the Indian side when this was being discussed as the French assurances were not “watertight”, according to a section of the bureaucracy.Significantly, among the seven reasons cited for withdrawing the UPA version of the deal in June 2015 was Dassault Aviation’s failure to furnish performance and warranty bonds and its refusal to act as a single point of responsibility. It’s unclear how the government resolved the issue of absence of bank guarantee given clear reluctance in the bureaucracy. Moreover, it is not clear whether adequate safeguards have been built into the contract to ensure that India can penalise the manufacturer for violations such as delivery delays or a failure to meet offset obligations.Why was Cheaper Option Rejected?The government’s internal notes show that a key reason for scrapping the UPA’s Rafale deal was that the French aircraft, though initially thought to be cheaper, was turning out to be more expensive than the Eurofighter after detailed commercial discussions. So it is unclear why the government selected the Rafale jets for purchase. The Indian Air Force had selected the Rafale jets after an elaborate process during the UPA regime. But it was not the only aircraft to be selected – the air force had also found the Eurofighter, built by EADS, as compliant with the requirements. When the NDA government decided to buy 36 new jets, it did not consider the Eurofighter, which was cheaper, as per the government’s analysis, as per the terms of the previous deal. In July 2014, Germany had even made an offer to the NDA government to further reduce the price of the Eurofighter by 20%, but India didn’t respond.The Germans had also promised to divert deliveries of Eurofighter Typhoon jets from Britain, Italy and Germany to meet India’s needs on an urgent basis. However, no negotiations were carried out after it became clear that only the Rafale was being considered by the Indian government. Critics argue that detailed discussions with Germany could have at least forced Dassault to offer a more competitive price for Rafale jets. That’s why, they say, talks with only a single vendor are avoided as much as possible under the defence procurement rules.Why Only 36 Fighter Jets?The biggest mystery has been how the government decided to strike a deal for 36 Rafale jets and not more given the much larger requirement of the Indian Air Force. After all, the figure of 126 aircraft was arrived at after much analysis to replace older generation Russian jets that are being retired. Even when discussions with the French side started for a fresh deal, the air force held on to its minimum requirement. It is believed that at one point, the top leadership projected that to maintain a viable fleet, it would require at least 72 fighter jets of the type and that anything below this would be sub-optimal. However, the final deal for 36 fighter jets was struck without even a follow on clause to purchase a similar number in the future (if required) at similar prices. As a result, the air force is now hard pressed for resources. Limiting the purchase of the cutting-edge fighter jets to 36 and the near cancellation of the fifth-generation fighter aircraft programme with Russia have left the air force at a dangerous precipice. If its plans to acquire 116 fighter jets under a Make in India programme do not take off within a year, 2022 will see its aerial combat edge dropping to an all-time low.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-deal-why-dassault-reliance-aviation-won-the-offsets-contract-some-unanswered-questions/articleshow/65495707.cms

2018-08-24,"NEW DELHI: The telecom department is likely to ask Reliance Communications (RCom) to furnish Rs 2,800-2,900 crore as spectrum usage charges (SUC) or give bank guarantees of the same amount, which, if not furnished, may lead to yet another hurdle in the Anil Ambani-owned telco’s efforts to sell its airwaves to Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) and pare debt.“RCom has to pay Rs 2,800-2,900 crore because their spectrum usage charges (SUC) are due. There are court cases related to SUC, so the operator will have to pay bank guarantee of an equivalent amount,” said a senior official of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), asking not to be named.The official said that RCom has already paid about Rs 200 crore of bank guarantee for its spectrum usage dues, which will be deducted from the amount asked for by the telecom department.“Their trading deal with Jio could hit a hurdle otherwise,” the official said. Spectrum usage charge (SUC) is the annual fee telcos have to pay to the government for using the natural resource.The amount has been a bone of contention between operators and government for a while.Adjusted gross revenue (AGR), the basis on which levies and charges are calculated for telecom companies, is a contentious issue in the telecom industry and under litigation.Shares of RCom closed at Rs 18.85 a piece, up by 0.43% on the BSE, on Thursday.The company, which has been forced to shut its wireless operations late 2017 due to brutal competition, expects to raise about Rs 18,000 crore by selling its wireless assets to Jio and realty assets to Canada’s Brookfield, and reduce Rs 46,000 crore debt by repaying its 39 lenders.RCOM SELLS MCNS, INFRAOn Thursday, the operator said it has sold its media convergence nodes (MCNs) and related infrastructure assets to Jio for Rs 2,000 crore, marking the first tranche of wireless assets sold to the Mukesh Ambani led telco under the former carrier’s asset monetisation plan.RCom's wireless assets that will eventually go to Jio include 122.4 units of 4G airwaves across the 850, 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz bands, over 43,000 towers and 1,78,000 route km of fibre with pan-India footprint.Recently, the company said that it would sell an additional 65 MHz spectrum in the 800 MHz band to Jio for Rs 3,500-3,700 crore which would help it reduce its debt further.The telco though has faced many hurdles to its asset sale plan.

2018-08-27,"Reliance Jio Infocomm has dislodged Vodafone Indian and closed to the gap with market leader Bharti Airtel in revenue market share, helped by strong performance in the rural mobile markets and aggressive pricing that has left rivals struggling.Less than two years since starting 4G services, Mukesh Ambani-controlled Jio’s RMS widened 253 basis points (bps) on-quarter to 22.4% at the end of June, financial data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) showed. Vodafone India’s RMS slumped 175 bps sequentially to 19.3%, while Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Idea Cellular’s share shrank 106 bps to 15.4%. Bharti Airtel’s RMS dipped 12 bps on-quarter to 31.7% as it staved off the impact of a cut in charges for receiving international calls in the first quarter, analysts said.Airtel’s RMS crept up from 30.7% in the second quarter of FY18, ICICI Securities said in an analysis of the Trai data. However, Jio’s RMS during this period almost doubled to 22.4% from 11.6%. “That Jio would surpass Vodafone India (independently) on RMS in the June quarter was expected, given its strong and sustained growth on this metric, but it now appears to be gradually getting within striking distance of Airtel,” Naveen Kulkarni, an analyst at PhillipCapital, told ET. Jio had overtaken Idea on RMS in the quarter ended March 2018. The company’s strong showing comes as Vodafone India and Idea prepare to close their merger, which will make the combined entity India’s largest phone company with an RMS of 35%, followed by Airtel and Jio.Both Vodafone and Idea have been losing ground to Jio amid continuing price wars. The two companies need one final clearance from the company law tribunal for a formal completion of their merger, which has gone past their expected June-end closure. “Jio is enjoying a freeway in B&C (telecom) circles, and its strong performance in the June quarter can particularly be attributed to the C-circles where its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) rose 17.2% sequentially, contributing 17% to the company’s overall AGR,” ICICI Securities said in its note.A telco’s AGR is the revenue derived from licensed services. In terms of subscribers, Jio ranked fourth with over 215 million users at the end of June.Jio, which started in September 2016 with a nationwide 4G network, reported an over 14% sequential jump in overall AGR (including national long distance revenue) to Rs 7,200 crore in the quarter ended June, while Airtel’s rose 0.9% on-quarter to Rs 10,200 crore, inclusive of 45 days revenue of Telenor India, a company it acquired in May.Vodafone India and Idea suffered sequential falls of 7.1% and 5.2% on this score to Rs 6,200 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, respectively, said Sanjesh Jain, a research analyst at ICICI Securities. Overall telecom sector AGR climbed 1.3% on-quarter to Rs 32,200 crore in April-June, helped largely by Jio and Airtel’s growth.“Positive movement in industry AGR bodes well for the sector, which suggests the trend will continue, driven by a rise in mobile broadband penetration and reduced ARPU down-trading,” said an analyst at a global brokerage who did not wish to be identified. Jain of ICICI Securities added that it remains to be seen “if Jio is able to sustain its strong performance in the B and C circles where incumbent carriers are fast expanding their 4G networks.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-inches-closer-to-bharti-airtel-in-terms-of-revenue-market-share/articleshow/65556052.cms

2018-08-27,"Reliance Communications has sold its optic fibre and related assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm for Rs 3,000 crore, marking another step in the beleaguered telco’s efforts to pare debt.“With the successful completion of the fibre monetisation transaction, 1,78,000 kms fibre stand transferred to Reliance Jio,” Anil Ambani-led RCom said in regulatory filing Monday.RCom shares were down 0.10% in morning trade at Rs 19.07 on BSE.Last week, RCom had sold its media convergence nodes (MCNs) and related infrastructure to Jio for Rs 2,000 crore which had marked the first tranche of wireless assets sold to the Mukesh Ambani-led telco under the former carrier’s asset monetisation plan.Last year, RCom inked definitive binding pacts with Jio for the sale of its wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and MCN assets as part of an Rs 18,000 crore asset monetisation plan to pare its Rs 46,000 crore debt.RCom wireless assets that will eventually go to Jio include 122.4 units of 4G airwaves across the 850, 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz bands, over 43,000 towers, 1,78,000 RKm (route km) of fibre with a pan-India footprint and the 248 MCNs.Howver, the lastest announcements come even as the telecom department is slated to ask RCom to furnish Rs 2,800-2,900 crore as spectrum usage charges (SUC) or give bank guarantees of the same sum, which, if not furnished, may lead to yet another hurdle in the Anil Ambani-owned telco’s efforts to sell its airwaves to Jio to cut debt.RCom also needs to pay Ericsson Rs 550 crore by September 30, as part a settlement over the Rs1,000 crore dues the telco owes the Swedish telecom equipment maker (NCLT), backed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Supreme Court.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/r-com-completes-sale-of-fibre-assets-to-reliance-jio-for-rs-3000-crore/articleshow/65558206.cms
2018-08-28,"Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries (RIL) has to keep firing on all cylinders, as there is limited scope for disappointment after the recent rally in its stock. The scrip topped the Rs 1,300 mark for the first time on Tuesday. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has risen over 43 per cent compared with a 15 per cent rise in the Sensex. RIL’s market capitalisation has grown to over Rs 8 lakh crore from Rs 5.77 lakh crore on January 1.Brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities has a ‘sell’ rating on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 985.It said a reverse valuation exercise suggests investors have not only priced in a robust energy segment performance in RIL’s current valuation, but has also ascribed the enterprise value (EV) of leading players in key sectors that are being targeted in RIL’s diversification overdrive — Bharti Airtel’s India business (telecom), Avenue Supermarts (retail), Flipkart (e-commerce) and key players in the media space (content ecosystem). In June quarter, as much as Rs 36,581 crore of RIL’s consolidated income of Rs 1,41,699 crore came in from retail, telecom and media businesses. It helped the company report a record net income Rs 9,459 crore, which was 17.9 per cent higher than that of previous year’s.Thanks to a big spurt in oil prices, RIL’s revenue jumped 56.5 per cent to Rs 1,41,699 crore. Of this, Reliance Retail more than doubled revenue at Rs 25,890 crore, while Jio reported a 13.8 per cent revenue growth at Rs 9,567 crore and the media business brought in Rs 1,124 crore.“The recent strong rally leaves limited scope for disappointment on that narrative, which may not be ruled out given the well-funded competition in these segments,” Kotak said in a report.The brokerage said the stock is expensive on several conventional metrics, such as P/E, EV/Ebitda or P/B, as well as unconventional metrics such as EV per subscriber. RIL’s headline valuation multiples are more than reasonable at 16.5 times FY2020E EPS, 10.5 times FY2020E Ebitda and 2.3 times March 2019E book value in the context of moderate earnings growth and a low RoE of around 12 per cent.“If we remove the fair valuation of nearly ex-growth energy business at 12 times P/E or 7 times EV/Ebitda, the implied valuation multiples for RIL’s consumer/technology business are fairly expensive even on a FY2022 basis at 19 times P/E and 10 times EV/Ebitda. Further, the reverse valuation of $79 billion for RIL’s consumer/technology platform businesses implies a value of nearly $200 per user on a cumulative customer base of 400 million, which is nearly double of Jio’s current base of 215 million,” Kotak said.There are expectations that RIL’s imminent foray in e-commerce business will face tougher competition from the deep pockets of Amazon, Walmart-backed Flipkart and Alibaba-backed Paytm Mall, and if it chooses to adopt a strategy similar to telecom, RIL’s investors should be ready for significant cash outlay for an extended period of time. RIL’s digital media and entertainment platform has its own set of challenges, with several companies eyeing the pie, including global internet behemoths such as Amazon (Prime), Facebook, Google (YouTube) and Netflix, telecom players like Bharti (Airtel TV), Idea-Vodafone Play and domestic broadcasters’ OTT offerings such as HotStar, Zee5 and SonyLIV.Motilal Oswal Financial Services is still bullish on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,477. “We increase our valuation for RIL from Rs 1,301 to Rs 1,477, primarily realigning our valuation for its retail segment with peers and recommend a ‘buy’ rating.”Chartists expect some correction on the counter in the coming days. Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in said, “For last 28 sessions, RIL is moving in a well-defined ascending channel with multiple touch points. Hence, it can be on verge of a fresh breakout if it manages a close above Rs 1,300. In such a scenario, a near-term target of Rs 1,360 can be expected.”However, as the upswing on this counter is looking stretched with almost a vertical move unfolding from the lows of Rs 1,182 in last nine sessions, a correction looks overdue. Hence, it would be prudent for traders to lock in profits and maintain a trailing stop loss below Rs 1,295 on a closing basis to ride the current momentum, Mohammad said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/beware-at-its-peak-ril-dmart-flipkart-bharti-a-media-firm/articleshow/65573570.cms
2018-08-29,"Reliance Communications (RCom) has moved the telecom tribunal against the telecom department’s demand for spectrum usage charges (SUC) of about Rs 3,000 crore, a move which could be the start of a lengthy legal battle that could further delay the company’s spectrum sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm and repayment to lenders.“RCom has moved TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal) against our demand for spectrum usage charges. The hearing is sometime in September, we will respond to RCom’s petition,” said a senior official at the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), asking not to be named.“Till matter is resolved, there will not be any spectrum trading deal,” the official said, adding that DoT will exhaust all legal options to recover its dues, before which it won’t clear any spectrum deal between the two operators.RCom did not respond to ET’s queries on the latest DoT demand. Shares in RCom closed down 1.98% at Rs 18.33 on the BSE on Tuesday.DoT had written to RCom last week, asking it to furnish around Rs 3,000 crore as spectrum usage charges (SUC) or give bank guarantees of the same sum. Historically, telcos have stymied DoT’s efforts to recover annual dues such as SUC and license fees, saying the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) was in court. Annual fees such as SUC and license fees are charged on the basis of a telco’s AGR, which is the revenue derived from licensed services.The ministry’s hardline stance puts yet another spanner in RCom’s asset monetisation plans through which the company intends to pare its debt of Rs 46,000 crore by repaying its 39 lenders. Key to that asset monetisation plan is the sale of wireless assets, including spectrum and towers, and land to Jio and Canadian asset management firm Brookfield, respectively, for about Rs 18,000 crore.RCom has been mandated by the company law tribunal to also pay Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson .`550 crore by September 30 to settle its dispute over dues, failing which any sale to Jio will be nullified and the company will be dragged back into insolvency proceedings. RCom also needs to pay Rs 232 crore to minority shareholders of its tower arm Reliance Infratel under a separate settlement of a dispute.The Anil Ambani-owned telco though has completed the first two tranches of its asset sale deal with Jio, which were sale of its optic fibre and related assets for Rs 3,000 crore and media convergence nodes (MCNs) and related infrastructure for Rs 2,000 crore. RCom wireless assets that will eventually go to Jio include 122.4 units of 4G airwaves across the 850, 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz bands and over 43,000 towers.This though is not the first instance of DoT threatening RCom’s spectrum sale to Jio. The carrier recently hurriedly restored bank guarantees, aggregating Rs 774 crore, to DoT so that the government did not cancel its mobile permits and spectrum, which could have potentially scuttled the Jio deal.RCom though had fulfilled a key part of its debt resolution prices last week by convincing its overseas bond holders to take a haircut. The debt-laden company said it will repay holders of $300 million bonds through a combination of cash and bonds of its overseas firm, as part of revised terms approved by those bond holders.The approved offer involved the bondholders receiving cash proceeds of up to $118 million, and $55 million bonds to be issued by Global Cloud Xchange Ltd, a foreign subsidiary of RCom.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-moves-tdsat-against-dot-demand/articleshow/65586723.cms

2018-08-29,"MUMBAI: Reliance ARC, the asset reconstruction arm of the Anil Ambani Group, plans to raise fresh funds as it makes renewed bids to buy bad loans from banks.The company will raise up to Rs 75 crore through the sale of non-convertible debentures to institutional investors as early as next month, CEO Ravindra Rao said.“This will be our first ever debenture issuance and will make us a deemed listed company and give us some fresh funds to buy more bad assets. We continue to enjoy credit lines from a few state-run banks,” said Rao, who took over as CEO of Reliance ARC in March.A part of Reliance Capital, Reliance ARC received the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) license in February 2008. However, it has consciously stuck to buying small loans owed to banks by small enterprises and individuals. Hence, its assets under management (AUM) of Rs 2,000 crore are less than those of larger peers such as Edelweiss ARC, which has about Rs 45,000 crore in AUM.Reliance Capital owns 49per cent of the company: Corporation Bank and Indian Bank own 11.5per cent each. George Soros’ Quantum Fund, through its company Dacecroft, and New York-based Blue Ridge own 9.5per cent each. GIC of India owns 9per cent, making the non-promoter stake in the company at 51per cent.The company’s total equity base is Rs 160 crore and total debt Rs 135 crore, giving it a debt to equity ratio of 0.8 times.Rao said he has already identified some assets and will raise funds for the targeted investments. He is currently looking to buy a credit card portfolio.“Our capital adequacy ratio is currently 50per cent, and we are adequately capitalised. But our debt to equity ratio is 0.8 times, which is very low. We will look to leverage up to 4 times,” Rao said.Around 75per cent of the company’s AUM is in the small and medium enterprises (SME) segment and fully collateralized.“Our resolution rates in these accounts are marginally lower than banks but given the intrinsic nature of delinquency, we do on a steady state recover monies from the stressed assets in the retail segment. We want to focus on retail because we think we have expertise and the capital can be effectively deployed. We are expecting a 10per cent post-tax return on equity at an enterprise level,” Rao said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-arc-looks-to-raise-fresh-funds/articleshow/65588375.cms

2018-08-29,"Shares of oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries have been on a tear of late, but Jefferies is not so sanguine on the stock’s prospects as its target price of Rs 880 implies a potential downside of 32% from current levels. The firm has an underperform rating on Reliance Industries. The stock has added more than Rs 2 lakh crore to its market capitalization this year, with half of it in the last one month or so due to its strong June quarter result and renewed optimism in its consumer services businesses. The company’s market capitalization surpassed Rs 8 lakh crore recently, making the most valued company in the country.The stock snapped its eight-consecutive session gaining streak on Wednesday, ending down 1.8% at Rs 1,294.45 after hitting a record high of Rs 1,328.75 during the session. Reliance Industries’ shares have gained 40.5% so far in calendar year 2018, beating the benchmark Nifty index which has gained 11% in the same period.“…telecom sub momentum is strong with RMS (revenue market share) also up 275bps (basis points) q/q (quarter on quarter) to 21.9% in 1QFY19 (April-June). This will reflect in rising EPS (earnings per share) too, even if they lag consensus, but capital spend trends should also be sobering too with net liab. (liability) trending higher than most expect,” said Jefferies.The firm expects Reliance Industries’ refining margins to ease from highs of the 2017-18 financial year as refining demand supply becomes less benign.Jefferies said the ramp-up of Reliance Industries’ telecom business may be bumpier than what the Street is acknowledging. Capital expenditure may halve from FY14-FY16 but could stay elevated, said Jefferies. Telecom capital expenditure will continue and exploration and production spend will pick up, added Jefferies.“Even if all goes well, return ratios remain modest and net debt higher,” said Jefferies. The firm said Reliance Industries’ valuations are rich with 12.5 times FY19 estimated EV/EBITDA-which is 30-35% higher than its past and 30-70% more than its peers.Bloomberg data shows the consensus target price of Rs 1,212.35 is about 6% lower than the current market price of Reliance Industries.

2018-08-30,"15% of Reliance SOTP is coming from retail, about one-fourth from Reliance Jio and the balance is coming from its traditional businesses, Jal Irani, oil & gas analyst, Edelweiss Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:How much of the Reliance market cap addition this year is based on the assumptions that the oil company/energy company has taken a giant step forward to become a telecom and a big data/retail company?It is fair to say that Reliance is firing on all cylinders. Telecom and retail is part of its core business now but rather importantly, its energy business will continue to dominate and going forward is poised for massive growth. One forgets is that $20 billion of investments have gone into its core energy businesses and $6 billion more is in the process of going into that business. Unlike the telecom business or the retail business which has a very long gestation, these projects are going to be very profitable. In fact, ROC is in excess of 20% but these projects have also started contributing to profits significantly and immediately. If you look at even this last quarter earnings, petrochemical alone has added much more profit than the Jio business. The Jio business added about Rs 3,000 odd crore of EBITDA but it is the petrochemical business which added Rs 4,000 plus crore of EBITDA to Reliance Industries. Reliance has got core competence in these businesses and these are businesses which in my opinion are understated in terms of profit potential. If you look at just the ethane import project from the US, it is about $1.5 billion and is already earning an EBITDA of about 0.4 billion per year. You get a pay back almost instantly within four years. So, like I said, Reliance is firing on all cylinders and the bigger contributor to the stock price gain is its traditional energy core business.Market cap addition for Reliance has come after the AGM. That is when it really blasted as a stock. In the AGM, Mr Ambani said they were on course to become a AI/data company with subscribers; they will use smart engines and then would be able to monetise or leverage them. Are markets now thinking that Reliance is trying to do what a Tencent has done or other global players have done? Is the appreciation in Reliance is still coming because of the core fundamental business?But Tencent is no longer a good word. It has lost some $150 billion of market cap very quickly. So perhaps you may not want to make a reference to that. Not only in this AGM but after the last AGM also, the stock did well after.A lot of things have been said in these AGMs and in the last AGM, Mukesh bhai had said that even the traditional energy business would make Rs 1 lakh crore EBITDA. It is not just one or the other and having said that, I think the Jio business is a fundamentally strong business. The value appreciation partly driven by Jio is also coming because of the market perception of risk mitigation. Two years back, everybody was saying LTE mobile phones do not exist below Rs 15,000. Who is going to buy them? LTE technology is not well established globally. Reliance does not have as many towers or cable network and essentially everybody was giving a 50% discount to the enterprise value on Jio. The driver on Jio is coming more in the minds of investors where from considering a negative value, now they are willing to consider a positive value.You said that the move in the stock price is largely being driven by the performance of the core energy business. The market perception is that a lot of it is coming in because of Jio and partly retail. How much would you give credence to the SOTP (sum of the part) story for Reliance?We estimate about 15% of Reliance SOTP is coming from retail, about one-fourth from Reliance Jio and the balance is coming from its traditional businesses. So about 55% is coming from its traditional businesses. We speak essentially to institutional investors, some of the largest in the world and a lot more is going on in the energy space globally as well. The refining business globally is poised to have its golden era. Certain regulations are coming up which is potentially going to drive up refining margins rather sustainably and very significantly, going forward. Besides, Reliance is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of rising oil prices. Essentially, three of its projects get very cheap raw materials and value adds and sells at value added rates. The higher the oil prices, the higher the difference between the two. Like I said, Reliance is firing away on all cylinders. One may just see a lot of news in Jio because it is more consumer facing, but in reality, it is being driven by several businesses and not just one.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-is-firing-on-all-cylinders-energy-biz-poised-for-huge-growth-jal-irani-edelweiss-securities/articleshow/65606578.cms
2018-08-30,"Sharekhan has a buy call on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,465.The current market price of Reliance Industries is Rs 1,276.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Reliance Industries price can reach the defined target. View of the brokerage on the conpany:Implementation of IMO regulations to benefit refiners as diesel cracks could increase significantly: International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has approved a reduction in sulphur content to 0.5 per cent for marine fuels used by the global shipping industry starting from January 2020 vs. current sulphur content limit of 3.5 per cent. The new limit is applicable to all ships outside emission control areas (ECAs) such as Europe and North America (where sulphur limits are already at 0.1 per cent). Industry experts expect a shift in demand from high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) to diesel as the preferred marine fuel and consequently expect incremental diesel demand of 2 mbpd-3 mbpd (much higher than the average incremental diesel consumption of 435kbpd over CY2000-CY2017). Hence, diesel cracks are expected to increase significantly from the current level of $13-14/bbl. Moreover, price differential between light-heavy crude oil could widen as demand for heavy crude (high sulphur content) is expected to reduce with likely change in refinery configuration post implementation of IMO regulations. Moreover, refiners would require shutdown in CY2019 to implement changes in the refining configuration and, thus, create supply shortages in the near to medium term. Thus, we believe refining margins especially for complex refiners could surprise positively over FY2019E-FY2020E.RIL likely to be the biggest beneficiary of change in IMO regulations: We believe complex Asian refiners such as Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are expected to benefit the most given the higher share of diesel at 40 per cent in the overall refinery product slate and ability to process heavy crude. We highlight here that for every $1/bbl increase in refining margins, RIL’s FY2019E-FY2020E EPS would increase by nearly 6 per cent and its valuation would increase by nearly Rs 45/share. We currently model gross refining margin (GRM) of $12/bbl for FY2019 and FY2020.Outlook – Robust for core refining and petrochemical businesses; Digital services on strong footing: We remain optimistic about strong earnings growth for the petrochemical segment on account of feedstock advantage from ethane imports projects and full benefit from commissioning of Refinery Off Gas Cracker (RoGC). Further, refining margins are expected to remain strong supported by robust outlook for middle distillate crack spreads (diesel, kerosene and ATF) and gradual ramp-up of petcoke gasification project. Moreover, robust subscriber addition, continued revenue market share gain and launch of broadband services would result in sustained improvement in the financials of its digital services business over the next couple of years.Valuation – Maintain Buy with a revised target price of Rs 1,465: We have revised our earnings estimates for FY2019 to factor higher subscriber base for the telecom business, offset by higher interest cost and lower profitability in the exploration and production segment, given the declining domestic gas production along with weakness in U.S. natural gas prices. We largely maintain our FY2020E EPS. We have increased our price target (PT) to Rs 1,465/share to reflect higher valuation for the telecom and retail businesses. Moreover, we see upside to our earnings estimate and PT if the likely positive impact on refining margin from implementation of IMO regulation materialises for complex refiners such as RIL. We maintain our Buy rating on RIL as we remain positive on the earnings growth momentum (expect 19 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2018-FY2020E).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-reliance-industries-target-rs-1465-sharekhan/articleshow/65606686.cms

2018-09-01,"NEW DELHI: Before it signed up for the Rafale fighter jets offset deal that has now become controversial, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence attempted to bag contracts from Russia, India’s old defence partner, but lost out on three major deals. Unlike France, Russia after consultations with India chose to partner with public sector units including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which will set up a production line for the $1 billion Kamov KA-226 light helicopter.In similar fashion to the Paris trip in April 2015 where the Rafale pact was first discussed, Ambani was present during the prime minister’s visit to Moscow in December of the same year, batting for major contracts with Russia for his newly formed defence companies.The Kamov contract was the first to be formalised during the visit. While Reliance Defence was in advanced talks to partner the Russians in the preceding months, Russia decided to go the PSU way. HAL is a known partner for Russia as it already makes the Sukhoi aircraft. The Russian side, sources said, was adamant that the private sector entity should be “government approved” for it to be considered. Reliance Defence did not meet this criterion, given that the government does not officially recommend or nominate any private sector company.In fact, three months prior to the signing during the December visit, Russia had informed the defence ministry about an understanding with Reliance Defence for a possible partnership. But it did not progress after HAL was nominated for the deal. During the same visit, the procurement of four frigates for the Indian Navy at an estimated cost of $2.5 billion was also agreed upon by the two governments.Talks With USC to Build WarshipsReliance Defence was in talks with the Russian United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) to be the Indian partner for building these warships. The company had even tied up with a Ukrainian firm that made the engines for the warship. While Reliance Defence was chosen as the preferred yard by USC, the government did not process the contract under competitive bidding, instead nominated the state-owned Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) for the deal. The contract however is yet to be inked and will come up for discussion during president Putin’s upcoming visit to India in October this year. “In case of four 1135.6 frigates, after inspection of different shipyards in the public and private sector, USC had identified RNEL as the preferred partner. However, instead of a competitive process, it was a decision of the MoD to award the contract to GSL on nomination basis,” a Reliance spokesperson said in response to an ET query.Perhaps its most ambitious plan in Russia was to partner with Almaz Antey, the manufacturer of the S 400 missile defence system, to execute the offsets for the mega deal. During the PM’s Moscow visit, Reliance Defence even entered into an agreement with the Russian entity for the deal worth Rs 39,500 crore. However, as reported by ET earlier, the Indian government decided not to impose the otherwise mandatory 30% offset clause for the S 400 deal, removing any possibility of Reliance Defence being a part of the contract execution. The waiver was given after an express request by the Russian side that argued that because the S 400 is a highly sensitive and advanced system, the offsets clause needs to be removed for timely delivery.While Reliance Defence did not meet with any success in Russia despite repeated efforts, it tasted its first major victory in the defence sector in October 2016, when it announced a new joint venture with French aerospace giant Dassault Aviation to target business from the offsets for the Rafale contract.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/before-rafale-deal-russia-rejected-reliance-defence-in-favour-of-psus/articleshow/65630899.cms

That deal came after several other partnerships and a rumoured mega deal with tech giant Apple that never materialised.Eros International Plc, which enjoys a market cap of $891 million, is based in London and is listed on the NYSE. The Indian arm, Eros International Media, is listed in India (`1,093 crore in market cap). Lulla has now charted out an ambitious $750 million investment plan over three years to woo Indian audiences through its online platform Eros Now. “I am looking at the next five years, and aiming at 100 million paying subscribers and an expanding relationship with the consumer,” Lulla says.Eros, set up by Lulla’s father Arjan Lulla in 1977, started off financing Bollywood movies. Young Kishore Lulla had moved out of India in 1980, and made a name for himself and Eros, selling Bollywood in markets across the world. In the new millennium, Eros started financing Bollywood flicks through a new innovative model, lowering the upfront payments to stars, and offering them a share of the profits. They signed up stars and directors for longer term contracts, reducing the risk. Despite lower fees upfront, the new model made sure stars made more money if the film became a hit. Kishore and brother Sunil, alongside contemporaries such as Ronnie Screwvala, Raghav Bahl and even Adlabs led by Anil Ambani, helped corporatise Bollywood and the way it funded movies. In the process, Eros accumulated one of the best libraries of content in Hindi and other Indian languages.While neither side has spoken much about the Eros-RIL deal, the latter, with its mega investments in Reliance Jio, has an insatiable appetite for content that it wants to feed the millions of customers it has introduced cheap, high-speed internet to.While the Eros stake acquisition is small compared with RIL’s other media investments, RIL clearly has a deeper partnership in mind. “We are pleased to join hands with Eros, as it will bring further synergies into our plans, making for a win-win partnership,” Ambani had said when the deal was announced in February 2018.What is Lulla bringing to the table? Eros owns the rights to 33% of the 100 top-grossing Bollywood movies made in the last decade. Its library is also the most diversified among competition, with sufficient content in other Indian languages. Also, Eros has now commissioned 20 originals (big-budget production for small screens, with top Bollywood stars) to take on Netflix and Amazon in India. This is a far cry from a year back when Lulla was negotiating with Apple to sell his Bollywood library. There were reports exactly a year ago of negotiations between Eros and Tim Cook-led Apple, with news reports suggesting that a valuation of $1 billion was being sought.With talks of a sale behind him, Lulla plans to be hands on — and may be for the first time he will personally focus on the Indian audience.The obvious question is whether Eros is doing the heavy lifting for Reliance Jio and will finally be bought out by it? Jyoti Deshpande, who was Eros Group CEO and MD prior to this deal, moved to Reliance after the deal was formalised to head media and entertainment at RIL.Lulla sees it differently. He sees himself building Eros and Eros Now, the online platform, fortifying it with new content and high-budget originals. He also points out he has deals with Vodafone, Airtel and InMobi, and Reliance, for the time being, is just another large shareholder.Lulla also points out Eros Now is one of the oldest platforms in India. It was started in 2012, after a discussion he had with daughter Rishika while on holiday. Eros Now has hit the 10 million mark in paying subscriber base by June 2018.For Lulla (now 57), life seems to have come full cycle. It is giving him a sense of déjà vu, of having been there and done that, but at a different place and time. Lulla compares his current challenges in the digital world to 1981, when he was in Israel as a young man of 20 to make his fortune. But he needed to learn Hebrew to crack the market. So, in Tel Aviv, Lulla went to an evening school, while he sold Indian movies to distributors by the day. He mastered the language in four months — and made money selling Bollywood flicks with Hebrew subtitles.Later, Lulla moved to London, his home now. Lulla recalls how he would load a car boot with 1000 VHS video cassettes of Bollywood movies, and drive up to Scotland from London — a nine-hour journey. He had noticed shops selling pirated copies of Indian movies, and had called home asking his family to acquire rights of old movies and send them over on VHS. During each journey, Lulla would stop at the shops, and sell five cassettes in each store, stressing on the legal aspect of the cassette.Today, Lulla’s challenge is quite the reverse of his early ones. The business of taking Bollywood global carries on (Eros has just released Bajrangi Bhaijan in Turkey). The focus now is the Indian viewer that uses streaming to view movies. And the competition is global.Just as Lulla had to move abroad to make his fortune, his younger daughter Ridhima has just moved back to India to head content for Eros.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/will-eros-handshake-with-ambanis-ril-become-a-bear-hug/articleshow/65638573.cms

2018-09-04,"Longer term, you cannot really lose money on Piramal Enterprises, Vivek Mavani, independent investment advisor, tells ET Now.Edited excerptsWhat do you want to start with – the M&M new launch, Crompton Greaves analysts day or Piramal Enterprises which has been on a roll ever since they made their analyst presentation last week?I will start with easier ones first. As far as Piramal Enterprises is concerned, last week the analysts were largely focused on their financial services business and there is a clear roadmap laid out. They have found new segments within the crowded financial services space in terms of having built domain knowledge over the last couple of years in real estate lending, mezzanine debt and quasi equity. So more into partnership deals and not just pure lender borrower relationship. Most important, in terms of underwriting skills or risk assessment, they claim to be better and so far, their track record speaks for it. I am absolutely sure that over the next few years, from housing finance, they will probably get into every segment within the corporate and individual lending spaces. But over a period of time, they need to improve their return on equity as far as financial services business is concerned. The market is not in a hurry because they are in an investment phase as they are building business but over a period of time, that will play out. The big trigger which everybody was waiting to hear and which the management committed to without stating the time horizon is demerger and listing the financial services and the pharma business separately. This will help do away with the holding company discount, that currently or even in future, Piramal will have.Near term, probably the stock has had a run and maybe we should see some sort of cool off and even a correction. Longer term, you cannot really lose money on Piramal. Whether the demerger happens in the next two years, three years or five years, the sustainable growth itself will ensure that there are adequate returns for investors. I would suggest buying on declines as far as Piramal is concerned.Give me your best idea for the day. Last time, you suggested HUL and TCS.Not necessarily for today, but over the next few weeks or months, I would look at Reliance Capital. I am seeing some deep value there. The stock has seen negative sentiment for the last couple of years thanks to what has been happening in the other group companies regarding debt and defaults and financial strain. Each of the five business lines of Reliance Capital has been growing in double digits. The five businesses are -- core NBFC business, life insurance, general insurance, brokerage and wealth management and housing finance. NBFC has both personal loans as well as corporate loan book, all of them growing in double digits. All the five businesses are generating return on equity in the vicinity of 12% to 15% and are likely to continue to grow.This $75 billion number was floating like hot air in the market yesterday. What can be its origin?Well, whether it is 75, less or more is anybody’s guess. I believe there is a window of another four months for FPIs to comply and importantly if India remains an attractive investment destination for foreign investment flows, I am sure the foreign investors will figure out other ways and means in terms of additional layering or in terms of complying with it because every country has a regulatory mechanism and globally funds do move across geographies. Regulation is never a hurdle for investment flows. I mean historically it has never been nor will it be in the future, number one. Number two, I am sure Sebi is also pragmatic and more importantly FPIs are running a business, investors are bringing the money in because they do see some merit of investing in India. So, this probably is a short-term knee-jerk reaction but I do not see a long-term implication of serious foreign outflows happening in the next few days or few weeks. I really would not believe that story.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/piramal-enterprises-a-long-term-bet-deep-value-in-reliance-cap-vivek-mavani/articleshow/65665880.cms

2018-09-05,"Directionally, we always have to be a forward looking mechanism, Shailesh Bhan, Deputy CIO, Equity, Reliance Mutual Fund, tells ET Now. Bhan is bullish on       corporate lenders, engineering plays and other cyclical spaces for next three years.Edited excerpts: You must be relieved that your core positioning has paid off with consumption and domestic and MNC pharma stocks outperforming very handsomely?It has been a very good journey for the pharma sector over the last few months and more specifically because we had seen a lot of correction over a three-year period which made valuations far more attractive than many other parts of the market. Most of these companies sell in over a hundred countries. They have a strong brand equity in domestic markets and have much better longevity than maybe 50-70% of other companies in India. These are solid businesses getting their due in equity markets.What is the case from here onwards? Will the pharma companies continue to give these kind of returns and at such a fast pace? Will the stock markets reward that because these stocks have already move quite a bit?You have to see the pharma space in the context of what happened in the last three, four years. Talking about the recent returns which have come about in the last three, six months in the equity markets, it follows three significant years of underperformance. During the same period, the other sectors of the market have done exceedingly well. They were trading at a premium though that premium has now narrowed down. The whole earnings revival cycle for the sector is yet to play out. The share of domestic profits in earnings of a lot of these Indian companies is already increasing and is getting visible. It is more sustainable and get very good valuations. A lot of businesses in the domestic branded space trade at material discount to consumer businesses having similar characteristics. That is one thing which is there. The key thing will be earnings recovery and the currency depreciation does provide a very positive tailwind over the next one to three years in the near term. These companies’ hedged earnings might take a little bit longer to show the reflection of a revival, but the currency tailwind does support earnings for these particular companies over the next one to three years.When we spoke to Sun Pharma, Lupin and Aurobindo Pharma - both on and off the record -- they acknowledged that the pricing power is getting better and price erosion may not happen but they are also indicating that complex generic launch is still a distance away. Sun Pharma is talking about 2021, Lupin is talking about 2021 and 2022. From a market standpoint, pharma may have bottomed out but the earnings recovery at least for US-based generic companies is still a distance away?There were two issues: there was a significant price erosion. The commentary from a lot of leaders in the space is that the erosion has reduced materially and it is to a large extent, normalised, unless you have extremely profitable products and where there is new competition. Directionally. the pressure on earnings which was coming purely from the US space is starting to ease. Second, one of the big things which is a big trend in the space, will actually be realignment of costs. A lot of these businesses were growing at 20-25% prior to the last two, three years and they were designed for that kind of growth. Their cost structures were very different. In fact, a lot of R&D which went through, had even maybe five-year, seven-year kind of spends into it in some parts of the component. A lot of this realignment will also support earnings recovery in the space. Typically, from a revenue standpoint, if you just see a lot of these companies were spending about 10%, 12% of their revenues as R&D expenditure and if you just take it as US revenue, those R&D expenditures was 18-20%. Given that the attractiveness of US market has definitely reduced from a point of view of profitability, you will see a realignment of these costs. Small realignments would lead to supporting earnings materially. Third, is the currency tailwind. Also, not to forget, the domestic space which is now doing very well after the initial GST impact, has now started to become maybe 40%, 50% of earnings of all these pharma businesses. That is a pure secular branded generic space in India which has got many years of growth ahead. As percentage share of these businesses also rises, the general support to the multiple remains. We are having multiple tailwinds. You also mentioned about the speciality portfolio. We have to give them credit that the investment in the specialities are happening and those investments are primarily being written off to the P&Ls today. Hence their earnings do appear nationally more depressed or more compressed than you would have in a comparable or any other sector in the space. Directionally, once you start seeing a recovery of growth, people start looking at these businesses from a three-year point of view. Then you start seeing this as earnings revival opportunity and inherently these businesses can actually get 15% kind of earnings compounding because of cost benefits, revenue comeback, stability in US operations as well as rising share of domestic profits. Directionally the sector is on a good trend.Your other big positioning a couple of quarters ago was on urban consumption and capex/industrials. What are the thoughts on urban consumer names because some of the stocks which you have owned in the past like InfoEdge or speciality restaurants have just gone through the roof?The urban consumption space has been reasonably strong now for quite some time and in some sense, passenger auto and organised retail are part of it. Organised retail has emerged as a very strong category now and are delivering strong growth. The velocity of store openings has accelerated in the right space. Wherever in urban consumption side we have seen companies getting their models right, the demand is strong and robust and the opportunity is still very large. We are very confident of the urban consumption story continuing the way it is. The other opportunity is the capex story. Government capex has been fairly strong and it has actually provided a lot of momentum. Execution is much higher today than it has ever been in the last four years and that is the good part. It is already visible in the share of cement consumption going towards infra projects in India. The big thing which is yet to play out or is in early stages of play out is the industrial capex in India. The utilisation levels in the capex side or the industrial capacities were pretty low because of many reasons -- be it domestic demand or GST implementation which took some time.Then, there was the impact of our currency. Till last six months, it was one of the strongest currencies in the last 4-5 years. All that impacted general utilisation of capacities. The utilisation has been inching up materially. The need for capex is now getting visible with lot of companies reaching meaningful capacity utilisations and that will possibly trigger off a very good cycle. In steel, for example, if they do not do capex today in the next three, four years they will have challenges in terms of meeting Indian demand.Acceleration in demand in power is already visible. Short-term rates are moving up materially. It is just a reflection that normal economic activity is reviving in India, especially on the industrial side.What one is seeing in the market right now is: A) a wave of uncertainty given the local as well as global macro environment. You are also seeing this wave of profit taking set in. Brokerages are talking about peak valuation when it comes to pure play FMCG names. Would you recommend selling out or profit taking in the current market? It is not like one single market having an average multiple. There are pockets of the market which are definitely pricing in next five to seven years of growth. One is consumer staples. The overall consumption basket, urban consumption might still be attractive, durables might still be attractive but consumer staples companies are valued at multiples which are at historical highs plus the growth expectations are already getting factored into it. When you see cost rising for them or there is a small shift in terms of earnings, the risk to owning some of these consumer names especially on the staple side keeps on increasing. That is one space which clearly is far more expensive than longer term trends. Even though there is longevity in the business, you should not pay extreme valuation for any business. So, consumer staples is one space which clearly is on the higher side of valuations. In an era where money is getting costly, a lot of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) without significant retail advantages or reaches are doing more. So, a business which a bank can do, will continue to see pressure. That is one space which looks challenging. Contrary to this side of the market, there is one more market which exists today where last three years have not been great but the visibility or the possibility of the next three years being very good exists. For next three years, opportunity lies in corporate lenders, engineering plays and other cyclical spaces.Three years ago, good fund managers would say that they do not buy consumer staples because the PE multiples are trading above their mean averages. But in last three years, those who have avoided buying staples, durables or some of these brand names, have actually lost out on a significant outperformance. Is it time to understand that these are businesses where growth is real, corporate governance standards are strong and where growth and demand will continue to surprise us? The valuations are higher today in this particular space. Let me give you a couple of rational thoughts on this. For all of us, these are very good businesses. They were very good businesses when they were valued much lower even three years back. Corporate governance was there, the opportunity was large. From 2000 to 2010, one of the leaders in the consumer space remained flat and possibly those companies were possibly even more underpenetrated.Anything on which you pay disproportionately larger amounts of valuations, where you are factoring three years, five years, seven years of growth. without an error, chances of things going around does increase. How we have approached this subject is a) we have participated in selective businesses there which are at significant discount to the specific leaders. b), There are many categories like the branded generic space or the pharma space which has exactly similar characteristic of the consumer space and even greater level of under penetration and less competitive intensity than compared to pure FMCG space. Those were available at 30-40-50% discount to these larger businesses on the pure consumer side that has provided a tremendous opportunity. Three to five years back, gold was the only commodity to own. No question was asked what should one do with gold. Gold is the most liquid, most safe, most stable asset globally but over the last five years, returns have been dismal. Directionally we always have to be a forward looking mechanism where we evaluate businesses and overpaying for anything beyond normal is actually dangerous for investors.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/for-next-3-years-look-in-corporate-lenders-engineering-plays-and-other-cyclical-spaces-shailesh-bhan-reliance-mf/articleshow/65686051.cms

On a year-to-date basis, benchmark Sensex has jumped over 12 per cent.

The broader trend in the interest rate is also headed higher in the next six months. We may see some slowdown in incremental money flows in equities as FMPs get better. Market participants will not mind re-jigging their portfolio. Strengthening of bond yield is negative for equities,"" Agrawal said. ""As a broking house, we recommend only stock selective approach. We still have a target of over 12,000 for Nifty this year only. Fundamentally, there is no sell signal.”ETMarkets.com drew up a list of five stocks which global brokerage houses are betting on. Reliance IndustriesGlobal brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on Reliance Industries with an upward target price of Rs 1,500 (Rs 1,365 earlier). CLSA believes that grand omni-channel strategy may be a big long-term promise for the stock and high customer engagement creates a big market opportunity. Bharat ForgeCredit Suisse maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on Bharat Forge with a target price of Rs 750. The company may benefit with sharp rupee depreciation as 60 per cent of revenues come from exports. “Order wins will help further diversify from CVs. The CV share is likely to decline even further,” Credit Suisse said. Peaking of US Class 8 trucks cycle is among main concerns.Grasim IndustriesDeutsche Bank maintained ‘Buy’ rating on Grasim Industries with a target price of Rs 1,430. The global financial services firm also said the robust earnings growth outlook is not yet discounted and margins are likely to remain strong based on global demand-supply dynamics. Volume growth should also improve substantially as VSF capacity is expanding.Tata MotorsNomura maintained ‘Buy’ on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 356. “JLR’s August 2018 US retail volumes are better than our estimate. For FY19, expect 4 per cent growth in overall JLR volumes driven by stronger demand in China. Stock trading is at lowest end of the historical trading band,” Nomura said.ICICI BankCITI maintained ‘Buy’ on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 390.

2018-09-07,"By Bhuma Shrivastava and Saket SundriaReliance Industries’s recent gains are helping one of India’s most-valuable companies catch up with the benchmark index, which it had trailed for much of the past decade.At close of trading Wednesday, the company’s shares had surged 135 per cent since it launched telecom services in 2016, nearly four times the advance in the S&P BSE Sensex, making it the best performer in the benchmark index. That brought its 10-year gain to 149 per cent, just shy of the Sensex’s 155 percent advance. Reliance shares climbed 2.8 percent on Thursday, adding to an advance this quarter that would be the steepest since 2009 if maintained.For seven of the 10 years through December, the retail-to-refining giant trailed the Sensex, partly due to doubts about Reliance’s $35 billion bet on telecom.“Reliance is coming out of a long period of consolidation,” said Nikhil Bhatnagar, head of global capital markets at Auerbach Grayson & Co., a brokerage firm based in New York. “The market was quite pensive on their abilities to build a sustainable telecom business.” The company’s investment in retail was also “a balance sheet drag,” he said.Some of those concerns have been put to bed after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. amassed 215 million users and started posting profits. “The company is challenging the market’s perception around Jio’s profitability and efficiency,” said Nitin Tiwari, a Mumbai-based analyst at Antique Stock Broking.Jio’s success has also given investors confidence that Reliance can disrupt other sectors. Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s July 5 announcement on expanding Reliance’s e-commerce presence -- challenging global leaders such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. -- triggered a surge in its shares.With plans to leverage its telecom subscriber base to bolster online retail, Ambani would be a formidable rival, according to Auerbach’s Bhatnagar.“If done right, it could help Reliance dwarf Walmart, Amazon in India over the next decade,” he said. The real concern, he said, is profitability given competition and the investments required in retail and telecom. “Owning Reliance had no better outcome than owning the index over the last decade and I don’t anticipate that changing over the next 10 years.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/top-performing-reliance-is-shaking-off-past-decades-slumber/articleshow/65716853.cms

2018-09-10,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has informed the Delhi High Court that the state government's ACB, investigating the company and others for alleged irregularities in raising price of gas from KG-6 basin, was asking for documents which do not pertain to the issue.RIL has claimed in an affidavit placed before Justice Siddharth Mridul that the thousands of pages of documents sought by the Delhi government's Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) ""do not pertain to the issue of fixation of price of gas"".It has also said that between April 28, 2014 and May 24, 2018, its officials have been summoned by the ACB 27 times.The submissions were made by the company in response to the court''s direction on April 12 to give details of number of times RIL officials were summoned and the particulars of documents sought by ACB.The court had asked for the details after RIL had alleged that ACB has been summoning its top officials merely few days before the hearing in the high court, to harass them. It had also alleged that they were just being made to sit there and nothing was being asked to them.The high court was hearing a plea by RIL seeking a stay on the probe on the ground that the ACB had issued summons to its three senior officials even though the agency did not do anything since 2015.Besides the company, erstwhile UPA ministers M Veerappa Moily and Murli Deora (since dead), RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani, former Director General of Hydrocarbons V K Sibal and other unidentified persons are named in the ACB FIR, which has also been challenged by the central government.The issue of ACB's jurisdiction to probe such matters is pending before a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court.The high court in a August 4, 2016 judgement had held that the powers of the ACB were limited to probing graft cases in various departments under the administrative authority of the LG, but not extending to central government employees. The Delhi government had earlier opposed the stay application, saying the high court had granted them relief that no coercive step would be taken by the ACB. It said if the stay was granted, it would also hamper the probe in other cases relating to central government employees.The ACB had issued summons to three RIL officials in September and November last year as also in January and April this year asking them to join the probe.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier asked the ACB to lodge an FIR in the matter.The FIR was lodged by the ACB on the complaint alleging the irregularities sent to the chief minister by former cabinet secretary T S R Subramanian, former secretary EAS Sarma, former navy chief R H Tahiliani and advocate Kamini Jaiswal.The UPA-II government had moved the court for quashing of the FIR, saying the ACB of the Delhi government had ""no power or jurisdiction to investigate"" complaints against the union government''s decision to fix prices of natural gas.The FIR was lodged under provisions for cheating and criminal conspiracy of the IPC and various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. All the accused have denied the allegations.The complaint had alleged that the impact of gas price rise would cost the country a minimum of Rs 54,500 crore per year at the dollar price then.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/acb-asking-for-documents-not-pertaining-to-gas-fixation-ril-tells-high-court/articleshow/65754094.cms
2018-09-11,"NEW DELHI: Indian companies bidding for an order for new air defence guns for the air force valued at over Rs 15,000 crore have put their best foot forward as the larger picture shows that orders worth Rs 40,000 crore are at stake for similar requirements of the Army and Navy.At least five Indian companies, including Bharat Forge, Reliance, Tata and L&T are in the fray for the contract by the air force to purchase new age close in weapon systems for protection of airfields and other key assets. The state run Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) has also put in a bid.While the air force is looking to buy 61 flights of the systems, only 18 of which can be delivered directly from a foreign partner, the air defence programs of the Army and Navy are even bigger in value. The combined value is expected to be in excess of Rs 40,000 crore, given that air defence guns have not been bought for over three decades.The program suffered a hit after Defence firm Rhienmetall was banned in 2012 on alleged corrupt practices. The German company had an air defence gun that was the only one of its kind in the world that met requirements drawn up by Indian armed forces.With the company banned, alternate choices were not available despite several attempts by the armed forces. The air force has since downgraded the technical requirements – specially the firing rate – to ensure a competitive process. Similar tenders by the air force and Navy are expected in the coming months.These systems are capable of taking down drones, small aircraft and incoming missiles. Indian companies have tied with up foreign partners for the bid, with three frontrunners that include Bharat Forge that has a tie up with BAE systems, Reliance that has a partnership with Hanwha and Thales and the OFB which has an in house deal with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).Foreign collaborators of L&T and Tata have not yet been disclosed. The contract requires that at least 40 percent of the content must be indigenized and that Indian companies be the lead bidder for the contest. It will however take at least three years before a contract can be signed as the next steps include field trial and evaluations.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/ofb-bharat-forge-reliance-in-the-fray-for-initial-air-force-contract-have-tied-up-with-global-partners/articleshow/65762313.cms
2018-09-11,"MUMBAI: It is rare for analysts to come out with varying ratings and earnings estimates for widely-tracked large companies. Most of them have almost similar ratings with price targets in a band. So when two leading brokerages released reports on Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company, with stark contrasts in ratings and price targets, it left many scratching their heads.Kotak Institutional Equities said the stock will fall to Rs 985, while CLSA estimated the stock could rise to Rs 1,500 going ahead. What is the reason behind this divergence?The gap in analysts’ estimates is unusual because of different values being ascribed to the company’s different businesses.“They have four major businessespetrochemicals, refining, retail and telecom. The divergence in target prices among brokerage houses appears to be primarily driven by the value ascribed to the core business followed by telecom,” said Ravi Muthukrishnan, Head of Institutional Research at Elara Securities. “There is some unanimity in valuing the retail business,” said Muthukrishnan.Justifying its upgrade in the price target to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,365, CLSA said it was removing the holding company discount on Reliance Industries’ retail and telecom business. Kotak Institutional Equities rated the stock ‘underperform’ as it believes the underlying weakness in refining and petchem margins poses risk to Reliance Industries’ earnings in the near term.Jefferies, in August, had given a target price of Rs 880 on the stock, which implies a downside of 30 per cent from current levels. The target price set by Jefferies, which also retained underperform rating, is among the lowest on Dalal Street.Shares of Reliance Industries, which closed at Rs 1,257 on Monday, have gained 38.6 per cent so far in calendar year 2018, outperforming the Sensex which is up 12.7 per cent in the same period. The stock had outperformed the benchmark in 2017 as well, following several years of underperformance. The company’s market cap has surged by over Rs 2 lakh crore this year to Rs 8 lakh crore.The Mukesh Ambani-led company’s telecom venture and its strong performance has helped the stock’s meteoric rise. Jio , which was launched in September 2016, recently overtook Vodafone India to become the country’s second largest telecom company by revenue market share.Reliance Industries had posted a record quarterly profit of Rs 9,459 crore for the June quarter, up 3.85 per cent from a year ago, on the back of near doubling of earnings from the mainstay petrochemical business. Gross Refining Margin came in at $10.5 per barrel against $11.9 a barrel in the same quarter last year. Reliance Jio reported net profit of Rs 612 crore for June quarter over Rs 510 crore reported for the March quarter.“The primary difference between Rs 800 (target price) and Rs 1,500 is the terminal value of petrochemicals and refinery business. Most bearish analysts are saying petrol prices will go to zero because mobility will come by electric batteries and they will take over and internal combustion engine will be dead,” said a chief executive with a domestic fund house. “The bullish analysts are saying that petrochemicals and refining business will fund telecom and telecom will become valuable. The bearish analysts are saying that telecom will be valuable petrochemicals and refining will be zero,” said the chief executive.Money managers said continued flows into ETFs and further clarity on the road ahead for the telecom business will help the stock maintain its valuation.That said the recommendations are mostly bullish with 31 of the 40 analysts tracking the stock having a buy rating on it. Four analysts have a hold rating and five had a sell rating. The consensus target price is Rs 1,220.85, which is lower than the current market price.“Those with long term view will buy Reliance Industries on every fall. Short term investors will sell thinking that GRMs have peaked,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VPmarkets and corporate affairs at IIFL. “There can be divergence in the market on how Jio will play out, how they will take out Amazon and Netflix. Its margins should be higher if crude stays up,” said Bhasin.Investment advisor SP Tulsian says he expects Reliance Industries’ market cap to touch Rs 10 lakh crore by March 2020.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/brokerages-differ-on-ril-stock-value-of-key-businesses/articleshow/65762564.cms

2018-09-16,"NEW DELHI: The Law Ministry has held that an international arbitration panel's ruling rejecting the government's demand for USD 1.5 billion from Reliance Industries and its partners for allegedly siphoning gas from fields of ONGC is a fit case for appeal, sources in know of the development said.The Oil Ministry had sought an opinion of the Law Ministry on the July arbitration award going against the government.Sources said the Law Ministry was of the opinion that the majority arbitration award was in violation of the terms and conditions of the production sharing contract (PSC), lacked required reason and was against the public good and public interest.A three-member international arbitration tribunal by a majority vote in July held that Reliance could contractually produce and sell any gas that might have migrated from adjoining fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) into its area and that it was not obligated to seek prior permission of the government for doing so.Sources said the Law Ministry was of the opinion that the tribunal had ignored the contractual obligation and statutory duty on part of operators to furnish information to the government about any migration of gas.It felt the award is a fit case for a challenge in the High Court, they said.With one member dissenting, the arbitration panel had held that the production sharing contract for eastern offshore KG-D6 fields ""does not prohibit but permits"" Reliance ""to produce and sell gas which migrated into the sub-sea reservoir lying within (its) Contract Area from a source outside the Contract Area"".And so ""there is no question of 'unjust enrichment',"" it had held. Reliance ""has not been and will not be unjustly enriched by any production of migrated gas as a result of Petroleum Operations conducted within its Contract Area"".In his dissent note, G S Singhvi said that the PSC prohibits Reliance and its partners from producing and selling gas which migrated into their sub-sea reservoir from the contract area of ONGC.He held that Reliance ""unjustly enriched itself by the sale of migrated gas, which did not belong to it and, therefore, it is bound to restore those benefits to the Government"".In the 107-page order, the arbitration tribunal headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Lawrence G S Boo stated that although Reliance had always accepted that there could be channel continuity between its KG-D6 block and ONGC's adjoining KG-D5 and IG block, its conduct is consistent with its position that 'reservoir connectivity' has not been proven.Bernard Eder, a former UK High court judge nominated by Reliance, was the other judge who concurred with Boo. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and the government nominee on the panel, wrote a long dissent note.""The Claimant (Reliance) requires no further express permission to produce and sell any migrated gas that could have come into (its) Contract Area,"" the majority judgment held.On the company not informing the government of a report commissioned by its partner Niko Resources indicating connectivity between KG-D6 and neighbouring blocks of ONGC, the tribunal said ""the alleged failure to furnish information if so proven would at best be a breach of the contractual terms of the PSC or at worst attract penal sanctions under the Petroleum and Natural Gas (PNG) Rules"".""There is no logical nexus between such breach or non-compliance with the claimant's right to extract gas which might include gas which could have migrated from an area outside the Contract Area. These are distinct and discreet issues,"" it said.The tribunal had said though Reliance's ""production of gas would have included gas which had migrated into the reservoir from a source outside the Contract Area"", it is ""entitled to all rights granted to it under the PSC and shall be entitled to retain and recover cost petroleum and profit petroleum from the gas so extracted, produced and sold"".The panel also awarded USD 8.3 million compensation to the three partners.Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10 per cent.In his dissent note, Singhvi said Reliance was required to obtain explicit permission to produce migrated gas.""It is crystal clear that the claimant (Reliance) does not have any rights to the gas which has migrated from ONGC's blocks,"" he wrote. ""There can be no doubt that the retention of the benefit of migrated gas would be 'against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience' thereby falling squarely within the ambit of the doctrine of unjust enrichment"".He also held that quantification of migrated gas determined in D&M report of 2015 was conclusive.Stating that Reliance should have disclosed the 2003 report of its partner Niko Resources, he said it may not have conclusively established reservoir connectivity, but it strongly suggested the same.""It is held that the claimant's failure to comply with its obligation to disclose November 2003 D&M report to the Government constitute a breach of the terms of the PSC and the 1959 Rules,"" he wrote.""Under the PSC, if a reservoir extends beyond block boundaries, the contractor may either seek permission to enlarge its Development Area, or jointly develop the area with the contractor of the adjoining block, or relinquish its rights to such reservoir,"" he said. ""There can be no effective lease or enjoyment of an area covered by a reservoir, if such reservoir is being drained by a different person on its block boundary.""The ministry had on November 4, 2016, slapped a demand notice on Reliance-BP-Niko combine for producing in seven years ending March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from ONGC's blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.Reliance on November 11, 2016, slapped an arbitration notice disputing the claim.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-to-appeal-against-arbitration-panel-rejecting-its-1-5-billion-claim-against-reliance/articleshow/65827377.cms

2018-09-21,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries Friday said it has permanently shut down its only oil field in the flagging KG-D6 block after production declined to nil.Reliance Industries (RIL) had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.""This is to inform that MA (D26) field in Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KGD6), which is being operated by RIL as an operator of the joint venture consisting of RIL (60 per cent), BP (30 per cent) and NIKO (10 per cent), has ceased production on September 17, 2018,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.Post-cessation, activities related to the safe shutdown of the field are underway.""Production from the field had been under natural decline and facing continuous challenges due to high water production and sand ingress. The field has cumulatively produced about 0.53 trillion cubic feet of gas and 31.4 million barrel of oil and condensate and had no remaining reserves,"" the company said.For Q1 FY19, MA field contributed less than 0.1 per cent in terms of revenue at RIL consolidated level.RIL said the Dhirubhai-26 (D26) oil, gas and condensate deep-water discovery was made in 2006. The discovery was developed and put on production in September 2008.This was India's first deepwater development (water depth up to 1,250 metres), with seven wells tied back through a sub-sea production system to a purpose-built, state of the art dis-connectable turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) production facility.""Relevant governmental agencies have already been informed,"" it added.The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter this year.MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 and D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.Output, thereafter, has only declined.KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 and D3 and MA fields.The shutdown of the MA field coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a FPSO unit, which processes output from the field.Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 11 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.RIL is now developing three sets of discoveries -- R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output.

2018-09-21,"NEW DELHI: In a fresh twist to the Rafale controversy, former French President Francois Hollande who was in power when the deal for 36 Rafale fighters with India was firmed up, told a French media portal Mediapart that it was the Indian government which proposed the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence as offsets partner for Dassault.“We did not have a say. The Indian government proposed this service group, and Dassault negotiated with Ambani. We did not have a choice, we accepted the interlocutor that was given to us,” Hollande was quoted by Mediapart. The interview was published in French on Friday and excerpts of it were put on Twitter by a French newspaper journalist.“On the other hand, this group did not have (any reason) to thank me for anything. I could not have imagined that this was in any way connected to a Julie Gayet film,” he said. (Anil Ambani-led Reliance Entertainment had entered into an agreement to produce a movie with actor Julie Gayet, who is also Hollande’s partner.) The defence ministry spokesperson immediately responded to the report stating that this was being verified. “The report referring to fmr French President Mr Hollande’s statement that GOI insisted upon a particular firm as offset partner for the Dassault Aviation in Rafale is being verified. It is reiterated that neither GOI nor French Govt had any say in the commercial decision,” the ministry posted on Twitter. If corroborated, Hollande’s statement would contradict the Indian government’s stand that the pact between Dassault and Reliance was a commercial one between two private parties, and that the government had no say in it.DECIDING FACTORThe Rafale deal, which entails procuring 36 jets in ‘fly away’ condition worth about Rs 59,000 crore, has a 50% offset clause, amounting to Rs 30,000 crore. This is to be executed by Dassault and its partners in India. Under the offset clause of the defence procurement procedure, a foreign company has to invest back a portion of the deal in India. Dassault and Reliance Defence had announced their joint venture — Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL), in which Reliance Aerostructure held 51% and Dassault Aviation 49% — for implementing the offsets.The DRAL facility located within the Dhirubhai Ambani Aerospace Park at Mihan will manufacture components, including those related to the offset obligations. Mihan is an aeropark next to the Nagpur airport. The facility will also manufacture components for the Legacy Falcon 2000 series of civil jets. DRAL will not produce the Rafale jets in India. The foundation stone of the facility was laid in October last year in the presence of French defence minister Florence Parly, Dassault chairman Eric Trappier and Anil Ambani. The offset obligations will also be carried out by Thales, Safran, MBDA and others.There have been no reactions yet from Dassault, the French Government or Reliance Defence. However, French industry sources said they were waiting for more information on the exact statements made by the former President and that the decision on offsets partners was a commercial one. The deciding factor, they said, was suitable land needed to set up a production line for Falcon jets. The land required access to an active runway as was the case with the joint venture facility at Mihan.The offset clause kicks in only three years after signing the contract, which in this case happened in September 2016. In a statement issued in February, the defence ministry had stated, “No Indian offset partner for the 2016 deal for 36 Rafale Aircraft has been so far selected by the vendor (DA) because as per the applicable guidelines, DA is free to select the Indian offset partners and provide their details at the time of seeking offset credits, or one year prior to discharge of offset obligation.” Meanwhile, the Congress was quick to pounce on the opportunity.Statement by the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs on the inter governmental agreement concluded on 23 septemb… https://t.co/dizZUaR7Dp&mdash; Alexandre Ziegler (@FranceinIndia) 1537557891000“The PM personally negotiated & changed the #Rafale deal behind closed doors.

2018-09-23,"Ruling out scrapping of the Rafale jet deal, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Sunday said former French President Francois Hollande contradicted himself and neither the Indian nor the French government played any role in selection of Reliance as offset partner by Dassault.A political controversy has erupted over Hollande's statement that the Indian government wanted the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence to be chosen as offset partner of Dassault, the manufacturer of the fighter jets.The opposition Congress party has raised fingers at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded resignation of Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Jaitley, in a television interview, said there appears to be some 'jugalbandi' (connection) between the statements of Hollande and Congress President Rahul Gandhi.""I am surprised…On August 30, he (Gandhi) tweeted that bombs are going to explode in France (over Rafale deal). How he came to know about that?""Though I do not have any proof of this jugalbandi, but this creates suspicion in mind…There is definitely something ... a statement comes (from Hollande), then it is contradicted. But he (Gandhi) predicted this to happen 20 days in advance,"" he said.Jaitley added that there is no question of scrapping the Rafale jet fighter deal as it is meant to meet the needs of the country's defence forces.""Koi prashna nahi uthta. Ye fauz ki avashaktya hai. Ye desh mei ana chahiye, aur ye ayega. (No question of scrapping the deal. These (jet fighters) are needed by the defence forces. They should come and they will come),"" he said when asked whether the government could cancel the deal in view of the forthcoming general elections in 2019.Earlier in a Facebook post, Jaitley wrote: ""The former French President's first statement rhymes with Rahul Gandhi's prediction.""The minister also accused the Congress party leaders of using vulgar language and said public discourse is not a ""laughter challenge"".""I have said how public discourse should be. It is not a laughter challenge. You go and hug someone, then you wink, utter lies 4-6-10 times. Your words should reflect intellect. Vulgarity and abusive language does not suit the world's largest democracy,” he added.Jaitley said a controversy is sought to be created on the basis of a statement made by Hollande that the Reliance Defence 'partnership' with Dassault Aviation was due to the suggestion of the Indian government.""He (Hollande) has, in a subsequent statement, said that he is 'not aware' if Government ever lobbied for Reliance Defence and that 'the partners chose themselves'. Truth cannot have two versions,” the minister said.Referring to Hollande's remarks, Jaitley said: ""The French Government and M/s Dassault Aviation have categorically denied the correctness of the former President's first statement.""The French Government has stated that the decision with regard to the offset contracts of Dassault Aviation are taken by the company and not the Government. Dassault Aviation itself has suggested that they have entered into multiple contracts with several public sector and private sector companies with regard to the offset contracts and the decision is entirely theirs.""As per the second statement of Hollande, Dassault and Reliance selected themselves as partners, the minister said.""This contradicts his first questionable statement which the French Government and Dassault have denied. The facts contradict the same. His second statement in Montreal, Canada to AFP (news agency) makes the veracity of his first statement even more questionable,"" he added.Hollande was the French president when the Rs 58,000 crore deal for buying 36 Rafale jets was signed in 2016.Hollande's comments gave fresh ammunition to the opposition, with Rahul Gandhi making one of his sharpest attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue, alleging the remarks showed there was ""clear-cut corruption"" in the deal and he must clarify whether the former French president was ""lying"".""Now, what the ex-president of France is saying is that the prime minister of India is a 'thief'. That is what this (Hollande's) statement is saying,"" Gandhi told a press conference Saturday while asking Modi to come clean on the matter.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/ex-french-president-contradicted-himself-dassault-chose-reliance-on-its-own-arun-jaitley/articleshow/65919993.cms

2018-09-25,"India will continue to depend on oil as a mainstay of its energy but its oil demand growth will likely slow as the government pushes for cleaner energy and renewables, Harish Mehta, President, Refining & Marketing at Reliance Industries said on Tuesday. India is pushing for intervention to support renewables, grid electrification, and the government is trying popularize natural gas and shared mobility, said Mehta said during the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore. ""This will lower down the growth of oil consumption (in India) over the next decades,"" he said. However, oil consumption will still increase to 480 million tonnes by 2040 as the renewable push will not compltely halt oil demand growth, he said, citing official statistics. To meet that consumption, India has been boosting its overall refining capacity with first production from its upcoming West Coast refinery expected in 2022. India has plans to add 190 million tonnes per year of refining capacity over the next 10 years to its existing 228 million tonnes per years, he said. ""Over a period of time, some additional refining capacity would also come and some of the exports which are happening through the private sector will probably get curtailed and would get consumed in the country itself,"" he said.

The number of individuals featured in the 2018 list increased by a third to 831 from 617 in 2017.Dilip Sanghvi of Sun Pharma emerged as the fifth richest Indian on the list, three slots down from the last year. “His loss in wealth in Suzlon, whose share value declined by more than 50 per cent, was neutralised by minor gains in Sun Pharma’s share price. In April 2018, Shanghvi bought a 3.8 per cent stake in Unichem Laboratories. In June 2018, the USFDA issue regarding the plant quality in Gujarat was satisfactorily resolved and the pharma major received a clean chit,” the report said. Sanghvi wealth is around Rs 89,700 crore.With a wealth of Rs 78,600 crore, Uday Kotak of Kotak Mahindra Bank took the sixth place in the list, followed by Cyrus S Poonawalla of Serum Institute of India (Rs 73,000 crore), Gautam Adani of Adani Enterprises (Rs 71,200 crore) and Cyrus Pallonji (Rs 69,400 crore).The report further showed top 10 richest families in India which holds Ambani at top slot, followed by Godrej, Hinduja, Mistry, Shanghvi, Nadar, Adani, Damani, Lohia and Burman.There are 66 NRIs from the Barclays Hurun India Rich List 2018.

2018-09-26,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio is preparing to launch fifth generation, or 5G, telecom services within six months of spectrum allocation, which means the Mukesh Ambani telco could well launch the services in India by middle of 2020.The government recently said it plans to allocate airwaves to offer 5G services – which can support download speeds 50 to 60 times faster than 4G – by end of 2019. “Jio has 5G-ready LTE network and we are capable of launching the new technology-based services within five-six months once spectrum is allocated,” a company official who do not wish to be identified, told ET.He added that the telco is aggressively deploying optic fibre which forms the backbone of a 5G network.Fibre rollouts is a key near term focus for the telecom sector, especially for the development of 5G in the country, a Morgan Stanley report said, adding both Jio and Bharti Airtel have indicated deployment of significant MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Softwaredefined Networking (SDN), to get networks 5G ready.The Jio executive, though, said the biggest challenge would be the readiness of the ecosystem, including availability of devices, which support this spectrum band. “If you don’t have instruments or routers to serve the 5G technology, this would be a challenge,” the executive said.Both dominant chipset makers— US-based Qualcomm and Taiwanese MediaTek— are developing 5G-based modems.Besides, the telecom arm of the Reliance Industries is in discussions with both local and multinational vendors to ensure the availability ahead of the device before the commercial 5G rollout, the person said. Globally, devices supporting 5G technology are expected to be available some time in 2019, starting with the highend models. Jio did not respond to an emailed query.Unlike previous upgrades to newer generation of technologies, 5G would take lesser time to go to market, especially for Jio which already has an all IP-based network, industry experts say.Telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan recently said the transition to 5G from 4G could happen much faster compared with the switch from 3G to 4G services.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has already invited Jio in addition to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) for field trials.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-may-kick-off-5g-services-by-mid-2020/articleshow/65958359.cms

According to people familiar with the matter, the case has been filed against the debt-laden telco for recovery of dues worth Rs 20 crore.Legal sources familiar with developments said RCom tried to come to a settlement with Paytm's parent firm but the talks fell through.For RCom, it is imperative there are no other spanners in its asset monetisation sale, which has been delayed because of various court cases.National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) Mumbai bench has scheduled the hearing for October 26.RCom and Paytm did not respond to emailed queries seeking comment. RCom, which has a debt of Rs 46,000 crore, is selling its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) and Canadian asset management company Brookfield for Rs 18,000 crore.While the telco has managed to sell its fibre and nodes to Jio, it is stuck in legal tussle with the telecom department over spectrum dues and till that is cleared, the spectrum sale to Jio can not happen. The hearing for spectrum dues by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) is on Wednesday.The operator, which has shut down its wireless business under industry pressure, will also have to pay Rs 550 crore to Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson by September 30 to settle a dispute over dues, failing which any sale to Jio will be nullified and the company will be dragged back into insolvency proceedings.RCom also needs to pay minority shareholders of its tower arm, Reliance Infratel, Rs 232 crore under a separate settlement of a dispute.Both parent groups have worked together before as well. In 2017, Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Capital sold its stake in One97 Communications to China's Alibaba in a deal estimated at Rs 275 crore.

2018-09-26,"Over the past five decades, term deposits in banks have emerged as the primary instrument of financial savings for the average Indian after former premier Indira Gandhi embarked on a mission to nationalise the lenders — 14 in the first tranche — on a rainy afternoon in July 1969. Coming with an unsaid sovereign guarantee of sorts, fixed deposits (FDs) seemingly offered investors liquidity — and safety — as nationalisation sought, in part, to arrest the 40-odd bank failures a year.Now, however, deposits must burnish their allure to retain leadership status in an increasingly crowded financial marketplace that offers choice. Take Ahmedabad’s Abhishek Sharma, for instance. The 50-yearold businessman moved his savings from fixed deposits to fixed maturity plans (FMPs), reflecting the increasing appeal of diversified and longer-duration financial products, such as mutual funds and pensions.“I was paying a huge amount of tax on fixed deposits: So, I locked the bulk of my savings into FMPs and a small portion in tax-free bonds,” said Sharma.While gross financial savings rose to 11.1% last fiscal from 10.8% in FY16, the share of deposits fell to 2.9% from 4.6% during the same period. The portion of shares and debentures rose to 0.9% from 0.3% and currency doubled to 2.8% from 1.4%, data from the Reserve Bank of India shows.Savers are looking at mutual funds and provident funds for higher return. “We have moved many people from FDs to FMPs and tax-free bonds as these are taxefficient and generate higher returns,” said Suresh Sadagopan, Founder Ladder7 Financial Advisories. “We are moving money to perpetual bonds and NCDs in the secondary market for better returns. These bonds offer guarantees and some even quarterly returns.”A PRONOUNCED CULTURE SHIFTPeople are becoming aware of more asset classes that offer better returns, and the quest for such assets became more pronounced after interest rates fell substantially over the past four years. Money is now flowing into both equity and debt funds. Stock indices hit record highs before the recent weakness: In FY18, the benchmark Sensex rose 10.23% when bank fixed deposits yielded about 6%.Of course, equity market corrections would reduce the flows. The big cultural shift that has happened is that money is moving in the form of systematic investment plans. Some of this is permanent rather than temporary, said bankers.In 2016-17, there was a sharp decline in hard currency holdings because of demonetisation. Today, savers invest as much in bank deposits as they hold cash. Currency as a percentage of gross financial savings was 2.8%, up from a negative 2%, while bank deposits were 2.9% down from 6.3%.DEPOSIT RATES AND CREDIT DEMAND“Since the banks did have surplus liquidity for the last two-three years, credit growth was lower and some liquidity came in at the time of demonetisation, lower savings moving into deposits would not be a concern yet,” said PK Gupta, managing director of State Bank of India.“If it does become a concern, then banks will have to start raising deposit rates,” said Gupta. “If credit growth continues to grow at a decent rate, banks will have to raise deposit rates.”As per the latest central bank data, deposit growth is 8% while credit growth is 13%. The trend has changed this year. “Banks will look for deposits at various places — retail savings, HNIs and some institutions will be the target areas — depending on the cost of funds as credit growth picks up,” said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank. SLOWING COMPANY DEMANDDemand for funds from banks fell as companies tapped commercial papers and the corporate bond market. Well-rated companies sold commercial papers to raise working capital. Better-rated companies went to the corporate bond markets for term loans.Bank credit fell to 4% in February 2017 on poor demand as corporates were deleveraging and new investments were not coming up. To keep up credit growth, banks focused on small and medium enterprises and retail.While SMEs would drive growth, banks are likely to move back into corporate lending as investment climate improves, capacity utilisation enhances, and demand for new capacity revives.“As liquidity gets tightened in the system and market interest rates increase, there is rediversion of funds from market instruments into the banking products,” said Bhattacharya.“That was one reason why bank credit rate started to increase. As investment climate improves and companies begin to consider new investments, banks are beginning to refocus again. Not the large infra projects, but we will see a return of corporate lending into the system.”The cost of funds for banks would rise if there is a broader shortage of money in the system, tight liquidity conditions because of foreign reserve operations, and lower government spending. “Money that we put in mutual funds, stock markets and bonds gets back to banks,” said Bhattacharya. “It stays with the banking system. But the money that households put into mutual funds and other instruments is finding way into the banking system through deposits by other institutions.” THE TAX EDGEThe three-year fixed deposit is not exempted from tax at maturity. Similarly, there are a number of taxes levied, like dividend distribution tax, short-term securities transaction and longterm securities transactions tax on mutual funds, debt mutual funds, stocks, gold, and real estate.“We are advising people, who would have invested in bank FDs to move to perpetual bonds and tax-free bonds, because in the secondary market perpetual bonds are giving 9% return, with some bonds offering 10%,” said financial planner Sadagopan. Adjusting for taxation, tax-free bonds or mutual funds give 7% post-tax returns, compared with 5.5% to 6% on fixed deposits.“Youngsters want to invest in equities to create value and they are looking at mutual funds in a serious way,” said Sadagopan. “They are investing in fixed maturity plans on a monthly basis and some are looking to invest in equities directly.”If FDs are giving 7.5% and the effective tax rate is 10%, one gets close to 5-5.2% return. Similarly, in case of FMP, if the rate is 7.5%, effective taxation comes to 10%, one gets 6.75%. It is higher than the effective returns on bank deposits.Will banks’ role shrink to advisory and fees as in the US? Probably not. Loans are an integral part of bank lending in India. “The US is a very bondcentric system,” said Bhattacharya. “Credit in US is taken from corporate bonds. Banks buy corporate bonds and syndicate them.”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/households-are-reducing-their-reliance-on-banks/articleshow/65960410.cms

2018-09-26,"Anil Ambani Group firm Reliance Entertainment Wednesday refuted allegations that it had signed a pact to finance a film by French actress-producer Julie Gayet, partner of former French president Francois Hollande, in a quid pro quo deal for getting the Rafale offset contract, saying no payments were made to her. Reports had suggested that Reliance Entertainment signed the pact with Gayet's company ahead of Hollande's 2016 India visit and India signing a pact to acquire 36 Rafale fighter aircraft under a government-to-government deal.  In a statement, Reliance Entertainment said it has not signed any agreement with Gayet or her company, Rouge International. No payment ever been made by Reliance Entertainment to either of them in relation to the film film ""nOmber One"", it said.  Opposition Congress has been attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government over the Rafale deal, calling it a scam that favoured billionaire Anil Ambani.  Reliance Entertainment, which has financed over 50 international films, said it had ""participated, through one of its partners, a French financing firm, Visvires Capital, in the film project involving famous French actor and director Serge Hazanavicius, and leading French actor Kev Adams"".  ""Reliance Entertainment has financed just 15 per cent of the overall film budget, and paid only 1.48 million euros. The balance cost of the film budget has been financed to the extent of another 15 per cent (on identical terms as Reliance) by a leading French investment firm, NJJ Capital, and the balance through sale of TV rights and pre-sales of global territories to a number of parties, tax credits, etc,"" the statement said.  The 1.48 million euros was ""paid to Visvires Capital on December 5, 2017, as customary only about two weeks before the release of the film on December 20, 2017. President Hollande had ceased to hold office in May 2017 more than 6 months prior to the said payment"", the statement said.  It said the company also received ""300,000 euros from the French producer of the film for providing physical production services for extensive location shooting of the film in difficult mountainous terrain in Ladakh"".  ""It is deeply shocking that, to serve narrow political interests, baseless allegations have been made by deliberately distorting facts and falsely attempting to co-relate a normal business course payment of a relatively small amount of 1.48 million euros to the supply of 36 fighter jets from France to India valued at nearly 8 billion euros,"" the statement added.  Reliance Entertainment said at around the same time, Visvires Capital also acquired for it the rights to remake a hugely popular and successful French movie, 'La Famille Belier', which is going into production in the year 2019.  ""In addition, as announced in the year 2017, Reliance Entertainment is producing an Indo-French film, 'The Interpreter', starring Kev Adams, helmed by the famous Indian director, Vikas Behl ('Queen', 'Super 30'), which is at the scripting stage,"" the statement said.

2018-09-28,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm is set to face challenges in monetising the users of its entertainment applications as it migrates from free subsidised content to a freemium model in future, a new report from mobile media and strategy consultant Strategy Analytics said.Freemium is an online business model whereby basic services are provided free of charge while more advanced features must be paid for.The Mukesh Ambani-led 4G telco is currently using its free entertainment apps to differentiate from competitors, build subscriber loyalty and create opportunities for future growth.“However, a willingness to pay for digital content remains low in India,” Strategy Analytics said in a report, adding that identifying content that users are willing to pay for, combined with business models, and a user experience that resonates with target customer segments, will be critical for successful monetisation.Jio’s suite of free entertainment apps has been an essential component of its strategy to go beyond low-cost voice and data pricing. Strategy Analytics Wireless Media Strategies analyst Brice Longnos said Jio was using content successfully to differentiate its proposition to mobile subscribers and to acquire and retain subscribers from competing operators.“Jio’s competitors Bharti Airtel and Vodafone are being forced to react by beefing up their own content strategies,” Longnos said. Jio recently merged its music service Jio-Music with competing digital music provider Saavn, integrated with Eros International’s video platform, and signed a multi-year deal with Roy Kapur Films to develop content for Jio branded apps.The 4G telco is able to lean on the media business of parent company, Reliance Industries, which has its own over-the-top video service called BIGFLIX and stakes in TV networks in addition to TV and film production houses.“Reliance Jio is investing in content and will expect its entertainment businesses to deliver revenue in the future. Whether it is a freemium or ad-supported business model, successful content distributors, including Jio, need to assess demand and willingness-to-pay for different types of content in order to successfully transition from free to freemium business models,” said Nitesh Patel, director, wireless media, Strategy Analytics.He added that Indian telcos need to do a better job in leveraging their subscriber data in order to monetise through digital advertising.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-may-find-it-hard-to-make-users-pay-for-free-content/articleshow/65987945.cms
2018-09-29,"MUMBAI:Global sports marketing and management firm IMG, originally known as the International Management Group, has quietly exited from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the holding company of the Indian Super League (ISL), just ahead of its fifth season.ISL was launched by IMG, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries, and broadcaster Star India, in October 2013. According to sources, Reliance directly owned 45% stake initially, while Star India had 35%, and IMG Reliance, the equal joint venture formed in March 2010 between IMG Worldwide and Reliance, held the remaining 20% interest.Effectively, Reliance owned 55%, while IMG owned 10% share in ISL. Under the new arrangement, Reliance has acquired IMG Reliance’s stake for an undisclosed amount, upping its holding to 65% in the league. “IMG is focused on delivering services globally and it didn’t want to own the league. So this year, they requested an exit. Reliance with its full commitment towards growing football in the country, agreed to step in and buy out the stake,” said a top executive with direct knowledge of the development.While its sudden exit without a formal announcement has fuelled some speculation of IMG potentially looking at an exit from India, another highly placed source maintained that IMG is very much active and growing in the country along with its JV partner.“IMG has enough interest in India. The JV holds IPs, including Tata Open Maharashtra (earlier Chennai Open), India’s ATP tour, and Lakme Fashion Week. It also represents top cricketers like Rohit Sharma, Hardik and Krunal Pandya and Jaspreet Bumrah. So, there is no way they are looking at an exit from India,” he said.In the past, IMG had played a key role in the development and operation of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Also, with its operations across 30 countries, it has interests across product and brand licensing, consulting services, event management, and has client representation in golf, tennis and soccer among other sports.An email query sent to IMG Reliance did not elicit any response till press-time Friday.ISL, meanwhile, has grown over the past four years and now sport 10 teams and is considered top league of India. The fifth season, scheduled to kick off on Saturday, September 29, at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata, will be a longer duration season spread across seven-months (with a month’s break).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/img-exits-indian-super-league-reliance-industries-ups-stake-to-65/articleshow/66002014.cms
2018-10-03,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries has initiated talks to acquire India’s largest cable operator, Hathway Cable & Datacom, in a bid to speed up the commercial launch of its GigaFiber high-speed home broadband services.Three people with direct knowledge of the talks confirmed the development to ET, while maintaining that the talks were at “an initial” stage and a deal was still at an “exploratory stage”. “It’s too early to say if the deal will go through or not, but RIL is aggressively pursuing it,” one of the people said. The valuation figure being discussed is around Rs 2,500 crore, this person said.RIL and Hathway didn’t respond to ET’s request for comment until press time Tuesday.Hathway is a multi-system operator, the industry term for a cable company that signs content and carriage deals with broadcasters, and offers the services to local cable operators.This is not for the first time that RIL is eyeing acquisition in the cable TV industry.ET reported in September last year that the company was in advanced talks with Sameer Manchanda-promoted DEN Networks for a possible acquisition. Those talks didn’t fructify and the RIL management decided to go solo on the launch of GigaFiber under its Reliance Jio Infocomm unit, one of the people said.“At any given point of time various business plans are being discussed at Jio. Earlier, the idea was to acquire a big MSO and a few smaller ones. We have plans ready on how to use existing infrastructure of MSOs to give both video and broadband services,” the person said.Another person said as Reliance Jio Infocomm was facing resistance from local cable operators (LCOs) in extending crucial lastmile connectivity in key markets, the GigaFiber rollout was slower than anticipated. “This has resulted in revisiting of prior plan of acquisition,” the person said. Hathway, which had a net debt of Rs 1,617 crore at the end of March, is looking to deleverage its balance sheet by Rs 500 crore in the next two years.ET reported on July 31 that the promoters of Hathway were infusing Rs 350 crore in the business over the next 18 months in the form of equity as well as long-term unsecured loans.Managing director Rajan Gupta had told ET in an interaction that the company got `100 crore from the promoters in July, while another tranche of `100 crore was to be received by August end. The rest of the funds, Rs 150 crore, would come by March 2020, while another Rs 150 crore would be generated from operations over the next few months, Gupta said in the interview.Industry experts said acquisition of Hathway would give a jumpstart to Jio’s broadband plans as it would bring in more than 11 million digital cable TV subscribers and 800,000 broadband users, out of which 90% users have high-speed (over 40 mbps) plans.Hathway’s average revenue per user for broadband business was around Rs 710 per month, in the June quarter.“While I am not aware of the talks between RIL and Hathway, it does not surprise me either. RIL already has a MSO licence and they have fibre laid out. All they need is LCOs support to get the last mile, which is missing. Acquisition of an MSO will solve that problem,” a media analyst with a top brokerage firm said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/ril-in-talks-to-buy-hathway-bring-broadband-home-to-you/articleshow/66047664.cms

Earlier, the idea was to acquire a big MSO and a few smaller ones. We have plans ready on how to use existing infrastructure of MSOs to give both video and broadband services,” the person said.Another person said as Reliance Jio Infocomm was facing resistance from local cable operators (LCOs) in extending crucial lastmile connectivity in key markets, the GigaFiber rollout was slower than anticipated. “This has resulted in revisiting of prior plan of acquisition,” the person said. Hathway, which had a net debt of Rs 1,617 crore at the end of March, is looking to deleverage its balance sheet by Rs 500 crore in the next two years.ET reported on July 31 that the promoters of Hathway were infusing Rs 350 crore in the business over the next 18 months in the form of equity as well as long-term unsecured loans.Managing director Rajan Gupta had told ET in an interaction that the company got `100 crore from the promoters in July, while another tranche of `100 crore was to be received by August end. The rest of the funds, Rs 150 crore, would come by March 2020, while another Rs 150 crore would be generated from operations over the next few months, Gupta said in the interview.Industry experts said acquisition of Hathway would give a jumpstart to Jio’s broadband plans as it would bring in more than 11 million digital cable TV subscribers and 800,000 broadband users, out of which 90% users have high-speed (over 40 mbps) plans.Hathway’s average revenue per user for broadband business was around Rs 710 per month, in the June quarter.“While I am not aware of the talks between RIL and Hathway, it does not surprise me either. RIL already has a MSO licence and they have fibre laid out. All they need is LCOs support to get the last mile, which is missing. Acquisition of an MSO will solve that problem,” a media analyst with a top brokerage firm said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-in-talks-to-buy-hathway-bring-broadband-home-to-you/articleshow/66049530.cms
2018-10-03,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Hathway Cable & Datacom jumped nearly 5 per cent in Wednesday’s trade after an ET report suggested that RIL has initiated talks to acquire India’s largest cable operator.

2018-10-04,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm has surpassed Bharti Airtel to become the second largest telecom operator in terms of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in the quarter ended June, latest data from the sector regulator show.Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio recorded an AGR from access services — or revenue derived from licensed services — of Rs 7,125 crore for the June quarter, up 14.6% from the previous quarter, while Airtel’s AGR fell 5.1% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 6,723 crore, according to the quarterly financial data released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Wednesday.The development underlines strong growth of the new entrant and declining strength of the erstwhile market leader. Jio had surpassed Vodafone and Idea Cellular individually in the January-March quarter, but would lag behind them now since the two merged to form Vodafone Idea at end of August.In the June quarter — before the merger had closed — Vodafone’s AGR fell 9.2% on quarter to Rs 4,483.68 crore and Idea’s dipped 7.2% to Rs 3,743.12 crore, to aggregate a combined Rs 8,226 crore. State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd was the only telco other than Jio to show a growth in AGR in the June quarter, rising 6.8% on quarter to Rs 2,273 crore.Given the pace of Jio’s growth, analysts said it may not take long for the company to go past Vodafone Idea in AGR.Jio’s entry in September 2016 had unleashed a tariff war in the telecom industry, leading to erosion of the revenue of older operators, dragging industry AGR down, and triggering a consolidation by forcing a slew of exits and mergers.However, helped by Jio and BSNL, industry AGR grew 2.40% in the April-June quarter at Rs 35,552 crore, after two successive quarters of sequential declines. Access services contributed over 70% of the industry AGR.Meanwhile, the telecom sector continued to see a slide in licence fee collection, which dropped 0.11% to .`2,929 crore for the June quarter. Spectrum usage charge fell 2.21% to .`1,023 crore in the quarter. License fee and SUC are paid by telcos to the government basis their AGR.The monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) for GSM service (in-cluding LTE) fell by 8.92%, from Rs 76 in the March quarter to Rs 69 in June quarter. As the industry players deal with low rates, customers are making the most of the free voice offers. Minutes of usage per subscriber have reached 608 minutes per month, up from 584 minutes a month in the March quarter.In terms of subscriber base at June end, Vodafone Idea with 443.5 million subscribers had 37.9% of the market share while Bharti Airtel (including Telenor and Tata) came in second with 32.26% market share and 377 million subscribers. Reliance Jio was third with 215 million subscribers and 18.42% market share.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-pips-airtel-becomes-no-2-telecom-operator-by-agr/articleshow/66062386.cms

2018-10-04,"Deven Choksey, MD, KRChoksey Securities, thinks that the RIL stock looks fundamentally good. And he sees a clear case of currency tailwind working for the company. He spoke to ETNow. Edited excerpts:ETNow: Reliance is clearly taking the markets down with it. You are seeing a sudden knock on Reliance Industries. What would you attribute that to? What could be the possible reason for that? Higher crude oil prices, a possible deal with Hathaway, overtaking Bharti Airtel, the number two telecom operator. Fundamentally, everything seems to be looking good. Would this have to do with maybe some debt maturity issue?Deven Choksey: Well, I saw the fall in the prices yesterday. And even today I asked this question: With the fall in the prices, have the fundamentals fallen for this company? And I started checking back and I found there is nothing wrong with the fundamentals. The refining business remains as strong as before or maybe, even stronger than before because the feedstock has changed. They have 60 per cent plus of their volumes getting marketed outside the country. So, I think probably they should not be affected even with the currency. On the contrary, I think currency play should be very favourable to them. Because if the larger cost of input is made by the exports, the currency should be favourably playing for them. They have a domestic market business in the form the petrochemicals and polymers. I think that is also equally strong, maybe it will be even brighter for them. On the other side, I think its consumer facing business or the consumer business as we call it like Jio and retail platforms remain quite robust and growth oriented. So frankly, at the macro level, at the top down level, if I see Reliance, I do not see anything wrong with their businesses, neither of the headwinds which we are worried about -- crude and the currency.

2018-10-05,"Anil Ambani-led Reliance Health Insurance, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Capital, has received final approval from the insurance regulator to start operations.

""The scope of health insurance in India is massive and, given the current low penetration, is expected to grow multi-fold over the next few years,"" Reliance Capital Anmol Ambani Executive Director said.

2018-10-06,"India’s new telecom market leader Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL), which will present consolidated earnings for the first time, is likely to report a sizeable loss in the fiscal second quarter ended September 30, paced by low subscriber additions and rising 4G network expansion costs.No. 2 carrier Bharti Airtel is also likely to post a significant consolidated net loss in the July-September quarter – a first in nearly 15 years – hit by a combination of factors such as mounting costs, rupee depreciation, and customer losses after the reduction in the price of JioPhones. Reliance Industries’ recent featurephone exchange offer had lowered the price of JioPhones.Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm, though, is likely to yet again outshine older rivals by reporting a higher net profit, propelled by strong customer adds and healthy uptake of its 4G feature-phones.For Vodafone Idea, brokerages IIFL Institutional Equities and ICICI Securities estimated a net loss in the vicinity of ₹2,600 crore, although Credit Suisse pegged it lower at ₹1050.5 crore. Revenue is estimated to be in the ₹7,813-8,106 crore range for the September quarter.Brokerages expect Bharti Airtel to report a net loss in the range of ₹8.4 crore to ₹1,266 crore. The company had posted a ₹97.3 crore net profit in the June quarter, helped by a one-time exceptional gain, and a ₹343 crore net profit in the same quarter a year ago.The wide variation in Airtel’s loss estimates is due to the possibility of the telco being hit by high depreciation and interest costs in the September quarter. Also, since 30 per cent of Airtel’s consolidated debt is dollar-linked, a 5 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the US currency in the quarter is expected to widen the losses by as much as ₹500 crore, said brokerage CLSA. Analysts also expect Airtel’s capex burden to rise since 50 per cent of the company’s $3-billion India capex is in dollars.Jio is estimated to report its fourth successive quarter in the black, with analysts pencilling in a higher net profit in the ₹622-795 crore range, propelled by 33 million subscriber adds during the July-September period.Shares in Vodafone Idea closed nearly 1 per cent lower on BSE on Friday at ₹33.55, while the Bharti Airtel scrip fell nearly 4.3 per cent to ₹296.75.BNP Paribas expects VIL and Airtel to report another weak quarter, with revenue declines due to “loss of customers post the recent JioPhone price cut and seasonal weakness”.Analysts said reduction in JioPhone’s pricing from an earlier ₹1,500 deposit to a flat exchange price of ₹501 has been the most aggressive move by the 4G entrant in the July-September period, which will particularly hit prepaid revenues of the two incumbent carriers.Vodafone Idea, it said, might also have to shell out a hefty penalty for exiting tower contracts, which if fully provided, could be to “the tune of ₹3,000-3500 crore, but is likely to be treated as an extraordinary item”.Bank of America estimates Airtel’s India cellular revenue “will decline 3 per cent on-quarter” due to the “Jio feature-phone impact on prepaid revenues, coupled with post-paid weakness”.Brokerage CLSA, though, expects Airtel to report strong performance in Africa amid stable local currencies, and estimates 6 per cent sequential growth in quarterly revenues in the continent.IDFC Securities said a combination of “weak seasonality, rising fuel costs and site rollouts would weigh on the operating income (Ebitda) performance of the incumbent operators”.Credit Suisse said “timely completion of Airtel’s plans to raise capital by listing its Africa business, and later selling its stake in the Bharti Infratel-Indus (combined tower entity) would be important for the Sunil Mittal-led telco to sustain capex investments on a par with Jio”.The Swiss brokerage estimates Airtel’s consolidated revenue in FY19 second quarter to fall 6.7 per cent from ₹21,777 crore a year ago. In marked contrast, Jio’s revenue is expected to jump 48 per cent from ₹6,147 crore a year earlier.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/voda-idea-bharti-airtel-likely-to-post-losses-reliance-jio-may-grow-profits/articleshow/66094893.cms

2018-10-08,"MUMBAI: The telecom department is unlikely to give an early approval to Reliance Communications’ spectrum sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) with officials saying they won’t accept land as a guarantee for the telco’s spectrum dues and will file for a modification of a tribunal order.And to add to the debt-laden telco’s woes, HSBC Daisy Investments and other minority shareholders in Reliance Infratel have filed for contempt of court proceedings against the tower unit of Reliance Communications (RCom) for non-payment of Rs 232 crore within the end-September deadline. They join Ericsson, which has already filed a similar plea, but against RCom chairman Anil Ambani, who had given a personal guarantee that the Swedish equipment maker would be paid Rs 550 crore to settle a dispute around dues by September 30.The Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT) latest stance will mean RCom is unlikely to be able sell its spectrum to Jio in 10 days—a timeline the telco had assured in the Supreme Court on October 4—which would lead to further delays in its payment to Ericsson, HSBC and others.The Supreme Court will next hear the RCom-Ericsson case on October 9, while the Reliance Infratel hearing is also expected this coming week.Last week, RCom got a big relief after the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), in an interim order, directed DoT to “expeditiously” allow the carrier to sell spectrum to Jio without bank guarantees from the debt-laden telco. However, the tribunal also directed RCom not to sell a land parcel worth Rs 1,400 crore “for the time being”. The land will stand as guarantee against the government’s demand for dues worth Rs 2,947.68 crore.“DoT will not accept land as a guarantee and we will request the tribunal to assure us bank guarantees. Also, the land given to us is not even part of RCom but another company, so how can we take that?,” said an official aware of the developments.The land to be kept as the guarantee is a 536,092 square meter parcel in Navi Mumbai, which has been valued at Rs 4,000-6,000 crore and belongs to Reliance Realty.“There will be no ‘expeditious’ clearance for the RCom-Jio deal. But the TDSAT hearing of October 16 could be brought forward due to RCom’s urgency,” the official said.Even if it the hearing is brought forward, it will still be touch-and-go for RCom whose counsel Mukul Rohatgi had last Thursday told the apex court that “things would work themselves out in 10 days”. RCom said that Ericsson and HSBC Daisy will be paid from the Rs 975 crore that it will get from the spectrum sale to Jio. Reacting to ET’s queries on HSBC Daisy’s and other minority shareholders' contempt plea, an RCom spokesperson said no contempt notice has been served against the company or its unit, Reliance Infratel, and “as per our lawyers' information, it may be lying in the defect before NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal)”.“Any such action by HSBC Daisy Investments, if true, is unwarranted,” the spokesperson said. HSBC declined commentHSBC Daisy and other minority shareholders had opposed the telco’s move to sell its tower assets—housed under Reliance Infratel—without taking it into confidence and dragged the operator to the insolvency court. The two parties had then agreed to settle the matter out of court with RCom agreeing to pay Rs 232 crore.The Ericsson-RCom dispute, on the other hand, is over non-payment of Rs 550 crore by RCom by September 30, the stipulated time limit. RCom has filed for a 60-day extension to the deadline both in the Supreme Court and NCLAT, which had overseen the settlement between the telco and Ericsson. The Swedish company has opposed RCom’s extension request.Last week, the apex court was made to understand that after the interim order of TDSAT, RCom will soon get DoT’s nod to sell its airwaves to Jio. But now with latest spanner from the DoT in the clearances, both Ericsson and HSBC Daisy may not be willing to wait further and this may drag the Anil Ambani-owned telco back into insolvency.RCom, under a debt of Rs 46,000 crore, is desperately trying to sell its assets to Jio and Brookfield for about Rs 18,000 crore. While fibre and switching nodes have gone to Jio for Rs 5,000 crore, spectrum and towers are yet to be sold to the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco and and some real estate sale to Canadian asset management firm Brookfield is also pending.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-spectrum-sale-to-jio-may-hit-surety-snag/articleshow/66113609.cms

2018-10-09,"NEW DELHI: The value of Reliance Industries’ alleged “undue enrichment”, owing to migration of gas from state-run ONGC block to its KG D-6 field off the Andhra coast, has doubled to $3 billion from $1.5 billion estimated in March 2015, according to government sources.With much at stake, the government has asked attorney general K K Venugopal to personally monitor its challenge to an arbitration award in favour of RIL. India’s largest private sector oil company had initiated the arbitration proceedings after the government had slapped a recovery notice for $1.5 billion. The government is set to move the court, seeking refund of the undue benefit seen to have been derived by RIL. RIL declined to comment on the issue.“The order by the arbitration tribunal in favour of RIL has negated Indian laws, which will be the main focus of the A-G’s contention in the appeal,” a source said. The government is also relying on the fact that RIL-led consortium of RIL-Niko-BP was aware that extraction of gas from its KG D-6 will lead to migration of gas from ONGC’s block and that it failed to bring this to the notice of the authorities. This was also highlighted by the Justice A P Shah Commission, which was set up by the government in December 2015 after ONGC moved the Delhi High Court in 2014 on the gas migration issue.RIL’s partner in the venture Niko had obtained a report from the US-based oilfield consultancy firm DeGolyer MacNaughton (D&M) in 2003, where the latter had said that if they extract gas from KG-D6 field, gas from ONGC’s block will migrate as well, the source said.ONGC had in 2014 dragged RIL and the government to the Delhi high court, seeking appointment of an independent agency to verify its claims as RIL wells were too close to ONGC’s block and that migration of its gas had taken place. D&M again gave its report in 2015, confirming what it had said earlier.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/undue-enrichment-to-ril-in-kg-d-6-field-at-3bn/articleshow/66129830.cms

So, what we always say is, 'We're working to help countries on their journey to self-reliance.' What we want is for countries to lead their own bright future. We want them to go from being traditional assistance recipients, to partners, to fellow donors,"" he said.""China's a very different model. They build dependency. So, the choice is self-reliance versus almost servitude. What they do are loans, and as we're learning more and more, often unsustainable financing that's mortgaging a country's future,"" Green said.The United States asks countries to take on their own challenges, foster their self-reliance, build their next generation of leaders, and then join us, in terms of leadership around the world, he asserted.When these countries do not pay their loans, they mortgage strategic assets, he alleged.""So, you see ports being, essentially, taken over by China. Sole, exclusive use of those ports. Dangerously extractive, often, strategic minerals, what should have been the birthright of young Africans, is tied up by financing from China,"" Green said.""And so, what happens is those young Africans never see the benefits. They never see the broad-based economic growth based upon their resources. Instead, the benefits go elsewhere,"" he said.While giving aid, he said, US asks for reforms. ""We ask them to respect certain rights and values. What we want for them is to become, eventually, trading partners,"" he said.""But equal partners, in that.

2018-10-11,"NEW DELHI: Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation has said that the document quoted by French portal Mediapart was a disclosure the company made to labour unions on its obligation to shift work to comply with Indian offset commitments following the Rafale deal.While the Congress linked the fresh documents to its allegations that Reliance Defence was ‘gifted’ offsets for the Rs 59,000 crore deal, Dassault emphasised that it freely chose the partnership and was in talks with “100-odd other potential partners” as well.“In compliance with French regulations, chief operating officer Loïk Segalen informed, May 11, 2017, the Central Works Council of the creation of the DRAL (Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited) joint venture in order to fulfil some of the offsets commitment,” Dassault said in a statement in response to the portal report.On the Congress allegation that the document was proof that the Rafale deal was conditional to offsets being given to Reliance, Dassault said that it merely stated that work was being shifted to an Indian JVto meet offset rules.“In order to deliver some of these offsets, Dassault Aviation has decided to create a joint venture. Dassault Aviation has freely chosen to make a partnership with India’s Reliance Group. Other partnerships have been signed with other companies such as BTSL, DEFSYS, Kinetic, Mahindra, Maini, SAMTEL...other negotiations are ongoing with a 100-odd other potential partners,” the company stated.The Rafale deal, which was signed in September 2016, has an offset clause that mandates 50% of the contract value to be invested in India. Dassault has stated that as part of efforts to meet these commitments, its DRAL plant in Nagpur was initiated in October 2017.“This plant will manufacture parts for Falcon 2000 business jets and, in a second step, parts for Rafale aircraft.

2018-10-12,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Tata Elxsi with a target price of Rs 1,440.The current market price of Tata Elxsi is Rs 977.25.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Tata Elxsi price can reach the defined target.View of the brokerage on the company:Tata Elxsi (TEL) posted a 5.4 per cent QoQ revenue growth in 2QFY19 with the key SDS segment leading the way with sharp 6 per cent QoQ and 20.7 per cent YoY growth. On the other hand, revenue from SIS segment declined by 11.6 per cent QoQ and 36.4 per cent YoY. TEL continues to focus on the higher-margin SDS business, with its revenue share at nearly an all-time high of 97.2 per cent. EBITDA remained flattish (+0.2 per cent QoQ) at Rs1.07bn owing to wage hike awarded to 90 per cent of its employees. However, on YoY basis, TEL’s EBITDA surged by a robust 27 per cent, aided by revenue growth (17.7 per cent YoY) and operational efficiency, while its EBITDA margin grew by 194bps YoY to 26.5 per cent. Higher other income (+197 per cent QoQ, possibly owing to translation gains) boosted net profit (+16.6 per cent QoQ). On the margin front, EBIT margin of SDS business rose by 186bps QoQ and by a substantial 412bps YoY backed by operating leverage and operational efficiency. EBIT in absolute terms rose by 12.3 per cent QoQ and 37.9 per cent YoY. On the other hand, SIS business’ EBIT margin rose 642bps QoQ and 174bps YoY to 17.4 per cent.Growth Outlook Remains Healthy; Stock Down on Macro Concerns: Going forward, given substantial growth being witnessed in digital portfolios of most IT firms, along with investments into avenues like connected cars, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR experience and automotive electronics, we believe TEL will be one of the key beneficiaries of the same, given its presence in these emerging businesses. We expect its diversified portfolio including automotive, broadcast, medical and design expertise to enable TEL to leverage these investments disproportionately. We would watch growth from IP-led engagements in future given scope for margin expansion, with the Autonomai platform a critical driver. Nonetheless, owing to macro concerns, global trade wars and issues with the British car industry - its largest client JLR has resorted to production freeze for 2 weeks owing to growth issues in China, and it reported 12.3 per cent lower YoY retail sales in Sept’18 - the stock has corrected sharply over the past 2 days.Outlook and Valuation: TEL achieved a healthy YoY growth in SDS business, while margin expansion is another positive. Looking ahead, we expect healthy growth, as the company focuses on niche verticals and services. We believe TEL is a good long-term investment bet, given its presence across fast-growing solutions, niche area of operations, design expertise, marquee client base, pricing power, operating leverage, healthy cash flow, returns on capital and strong earnings growth. However, global macro concerns regarding trade wars and issues in the British car industry could keep the stock range-bound in the near-term. At the CMP, the stock trades at a PE of 19.5x/16.9x FY19E/FY20E EPS, respectively, which we believe to be reasonable in light of healthy growth and strong operating and financial metrics. Reducing our target multiple to 25x from 28x, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised Target Price of Rs1,440 (from Rs1,610 earlier).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-tata-elxsi-target-rs-1440-reliance-securities/articleshow/66173624.cms

2018-10-12,"ET spoke to Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities about the telecom industry and the upcoming 5G auction.Q. Give us your view of the telecom industry as a whole.The industry is clearly a three-player structure now. The top three players, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Jio - they have close to 90% of revenue and market share. And clearly Jio is the one who is gaining market share, Airtel is somehow able to manage its market share and Vodafone Idea have been losing market share. This will continue till Vodafone Idea are able to scale up their network quality to a certain level where they stop losing customers or start getting back customers. The market right now can be divided into smartphone users and non-smartphone users.Q. Is it value versus volume?No that's not the case. Everything is a volume play right now. But there are customers who pay a higher RPU (revenue per user). Typically, these are postpaid users. They had been really sticky with the incumbents. I believe even they’ve started to move out now.Q. The industry has been struggling with a lot of debt. Now that consolidation that has happened, can we expect pricing to go up and profitability to return for incumbents?Who is struggling? It's Vodafone Idea and Bharti, struggling with debt. Not so much Jio.Firstly, Jio has a far greater amount of capacity on the network than both the competitors put together. The second is that as long as they [Jio] keep gaining market share, why would they want to change the pricing? If you stop gaining market share or if the market share gains start to come down substantially, then you lower the incremental amount you’re investing in the form of marketing or any other aspect. There has to be a decreasing economies of scale, according to their benchmarks. We have probably not reached that stage. They’re still gaining a huge amount of subscribers every month. It's unlikely that they will increase the price in the immediate term.It though can happen very quickly – in a 3-6 months’ time frame. These inflection points are anybody's guess. Pricing is bound to move up. In fact, pricing had moved up. Then from this January, prices started going down again. Jio launched services in 2016. In May 2017 we started seeing an improvement in pricing, but in January again the prices were brought down.Q. Why was that the case?Since Bharti cut prices, Jio also cut prices. They wanted to maintain a discount from the leading operators. If the incumbents cut prices, then they will cut prices further.Q. What's your outlook on 5G? Is there appetite for 5G?My sense is that there is not much appetite for 5G. That's anybody's guess till it gets launched. Will it get to be mainstream? I can’t say whether that will be the case. Technically it's a capacity product, it's not a coverage product.4G is a coverage as well as capacity product. 5G is only capacity. You can't use it for covering rural areas or highways. This is because it operates on a much higher frequency band and the amount of speed that 5G talks about is something which is not required for the kind of applications we use. 4G suffices for applications like watching videos, et cetera. You might need 5G play in central business districts like BKC or Nariman Point or Andheri where the population density and the number of smartphone users is very high.There can be requirements for 5G in creating hotspots in railway stations and airports. But is it a mainstream play? There is a question mark on that.Has anybody cracked a proper business model for 5G? No one has started making money on 5G [abroad]. 4G is a successful business model. There are enough examples around the world where it is a proven product. 5G is still some years away. Its utility might be very different - more for hot spots, business districts and corporate use.Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other. If you have a higher frequency, then the attenuation (energy loss) is higher. The waves will not travel very far. On the other hand, the amount of data that can be transferred is higher on a higher frequency band. India has never been a pure quality play. It's always been a coverage play.Q. In India, we lag behind when it comes to speed – be it wireless or broadband. Could 5G fill in this niche - of people who want higher speed?There is no straightforward answer to this question. We are not lagging behind because of technology. Quality will go up when pricing goes up. When prices go up, there are lesser customers and quality goes up.Q. Can't these two things co-exist – quality and value?It’s difficult in wireless. You can have a much higher speed and lower tariffs in wireless, as long as there’s an RoI (return on investment). Wireless will always have a limitation in terms of capacity. That's why you can talk about 5G, but where is the return on the capital? Nobody is making money in the business at the end of the day. The industry put together is making losses. There are four players who have shut down. You can talk about 5G, but where is the return on the capital? I don't know what the future is. You can keep investing, but people aren’t paying. The industry was close to Rs.2 lakh crore revenue in 2014. Now the industry is close to Rs.1.2 lakh crore revenue. That's down 40%. Investments have gone up by hundred percent. How do you make money? When you look at the debt numbers, Bharti is at around Rs1 lakh crores. Idea Vodafone at around Rs1.2 lakh crore. We don't know the debt for Jio.Q. Is there a limit on 4G speed that can be offered?There is a limit to the speed on every network. But it's not the speed. It's about how many customers you can service, with a low error rate and what kind of coverage you can offer.There are multiple aspects to a network - one is coverage. The second is what does it cost to get that coverage. What will it take to establish a pan India 5G network? Let's say around a 100 million dollars. Maybe more?Jio has a pan India 4G network. With the kind of capacity that they've built, they've invested around Rs.3-3.5 lakh crore. If you double that number, triple or qudaruple that number, you'll get a pan-India 5G network. You're probably increase the speed you’re providing right now on 4G by five times. That's good enough speed, but what is it for? Who is it for?And will we have enough 5G-ready handsets by then?Q. Could we be looking at a 2-player scenario in the future?Everyday, the likelihood of that is increasing. Unlike in banking, where the government props up banks because they’re too big to fail, because they’re systemically important, there’s no precedent for that in telecom. If it becomes a 2-player scenario, then prices are bound to move up.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/likelyhood-of-2-player-market-in-telecom-increasing-every-day-reliance-securities-naveen-kulkarni/articleshow/66182044.cms

2018-10-15,"Reliance Defence could get just over 3 per cent of the Rs 30,000-crore Dassault Aviation offsets contract, contrary to the impression that it is the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale fighter jets deal. The joint venture, Dassault Reliance Aviation Limited (DRAL), will see an investment capped at €100 million (Rs 850 crore) for setting up a plant to manufacture parts for Falcon executive jets, ET has learnt. Additionally, a smaller investment would be made for a joint venture with avionics and radar manufacturer Thales, which is also setting up an assembly plant for radars adjacent to the DRAL complex in Nagpur, ET has been informed. Officials pointed out that offsets for Rafale are divided into four parts between Dassault (the integrator), Thales (radars and avionics), Safran (engines and electronics) and MBDA (weapons). Out of the total commitment of Rs 30,000 crore, Dassault Aviation has to invest in offsets to the tune of Rs 6,500 crore, according to Air Marshal R Nambiar, deputy chief of air staff till last month. Dassault Aviation chief Eric Trappier has now come on record to say that its joint venture with Reliance Defence is geared towards meeting about 10 per cent of this offset obligation for the Rafale fighter jet deal. “Dassault Aviation decided to set up DRAL joint venture with Reliance and build a plant in Nagpur, which should enable us to meet about 10 per cent of the offset obligations. We are in negotiations with about a hundred Indian companies and partnerships have already been concluded with about thirty of them,” the executive said in an interview to AFP. ET has learnt that though the offset plans have not been formalised and presented to the government yet, there is still time as per the policy till October 2019 to share details with the ministry — the share of offsets for Reliance Defence in the deal could be capped at about 3 per cent of the total offsets. Other beneficiaries of the contract include the Defence Research and Development Organisation for which negotiations are on to revive the Kaveri jet engine programme. French manufacturer Safran is in talks with the Indian team to work out modalities, including work share and transfer of technology that could be counted towards meeting the offset obligations. Safran is also likely to discharge a part of its commitments through Hindustan Aeronautics Limited with which it has a joint venture to manufacture helicopter engines. Thales is likely to have defence public sector unit Bharat Electronics Limited as a major offset partner, besides Larsen and Toubro.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/reliance-defence-to-get-3-of-rs-30000-crore-offset/articleshow/66228334.cms

2018-10-16,"NEW DELHI: Oil-to-telecom giant Reliance Industries will announce its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts and investors will be keenly watching for any drop in gross refining margin (GRM), growth in petchem business and the o utlook for the digital business. Brokerage Sharekhan expects RIL to benefit from a weak rupee and higher petrochemical volumes and margins.RIL’s GRM is expected to remain largely flat sequentially at $10.6 a barrel in Q2FY2019, down from $12 a barrel in September quarter of last year.“Overall, we expect RIL’s Q2FY2019 earnings to increase 7.8 per cent YoY (up 1 per cent QoQ) to Rs 8,906 crore,” the brokerage said.Edelweiss Securities expects a 52.8 per cent YoY growth in refining business and a 54.1 per cent YoY growth in petchem business. The two businesses would drive revenue growth for the company, which would be aided by higher oil prices (up 44.7 per cent YoY) and a depreciating rupee ( down 8.8 per cent YoY).“Higher petchem margins (up 19.4 per cent) led by higher volumes (up 13.1 per cent YoY) will more than offset any fall in GRM,” the brokerage said.HDFC Securities expects the second most-valued firm on BSE to report 12.1 per cent YoY rise in adjusted standalone net profit at Rs 9,269 crore on a 34.1 per cent YoY rise in revenues at Rs 19,876 crore. The brokerage sees Ebitda margin at 17.5 per cent, down 148.60 basis points.“We expect GRM of $10.9 a barrel during the quarter. Besides, we expect higher petchem earnings owing to a rampup in production from ROGC and Px plants,” the brokerage said. Sharekhan said earnings from Reliance's digital business is expected to grow steadily given the likely gain in revenue market share and increased focus on additional revenue streams through launch of fixed-line broadband services through Jio GigaFibre.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/can-ril-protect-grm-in-sept-quarter-earnings-5-key-things-to-watch/articleshow/66248583.cms

2018-10-17,"MUMBAI: Those keen on punting on RIL for share price movement post its Q2 results after market hours on Wednesday could initiate a short straddle on the near month at the money (ATM) options of the oil and gas to telecom behemoth.A short straddle consists of selling a call and put option of the same strike price in the hope that the share will remain rangebound and enable the seller to pocket much of the premium (paid by the buyer) immediately after an important event, like results, or at the expiration of derivatives contracts.In RIL, derivatives experts like Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities and Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal, suggest a “short straddle.” Going by data from the past five quarters, RIL has moved in a range of minus 3.18 per cent and 3.76 per cent.“A short straddle will enable sellers to pocket a chunk of premium as implied volatility will fall post the results on Wednesday,” said Taparia. “This typically results in options premia declining by as much as 25 per cent.”To illustrate, RIL closed at Rs 1,166 a share Tuesday. The 1,160 options, expiring on October 25, are at the money. The sale of a 1,160 straddle yields a combined Rs 63 premium to the seller. The range is simply arrived at by adding the premium to and subtracting it from CMP (1,166).This is Rs 1,097-1,223. The upper end of the range is 4.8 per cent from Tuesday closing and the lower end is 5.9 per cent below it. “Considering volatility of past quarterly results, this shows that short straddle will yield a decent gain, if initiated,” said Palviya.The strategy is agnostic direction but bets on fall in option IVs and rangebound movement.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-traders-can-play-ril-on-q2-results-day/articleshow/66254520.cms

Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange (SGX Nifty) traded with solid gains this morning, signalling a good day ahead.At 8 am this morning, SGX Nifty was up 109.50 points, or 1.03 per cent, at 10,694. Here is a look at the top stocks that may hog limelight in Wednesday's session:Infosys: IT giant Infosys on Tuesday reported a 10.30 per cent YoY rise in profit at Rs 4,110 crore for September quarter, largely in line with a Rs 4,048 crore profit estimate that analysts had projected. The company maintained its full-year guidance for top-line growth and margins, disappointing analysts who expected the IT services company to paint a rosier picture.Hero MotoCorp: The two-wheeler maker on Tuesday beat Street estimates to report a 3.4 per cent year-on-year drop in September quarter profit at Rs 976.30 crore. Revenues rose 8.6 per cent on a yearly basis to Rs 9,090 crore. Volumes grew 5.5 per cent year-on-year to 2.13 lakh units, thanks mainly to higher de mand in rural markets. Reliance Industries: Reliance Industries is likely to post an 18 per cent growth in second quarter net income on Wednesday, underpinned by higher volume and prices in the petrochemical business. This would be the third quarter in a row in which the company would post double-digit earnings growth, the first time since September 2016. Consolidated net profit is expected to be Rs 9,543 crore in the September quarter, compared with Rs 8,109 crore in the year-ago period, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.IIFL Holdings: IIFL Holdings on Tuesday said its subsidiary IIFL Home Finance has raised Rs 1,000 crore from the National Housing Bank (NHB). IIFL Home Finance has raised another $50 million from SBI through External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) route.JSW Steel: More than two-thirds of lenders to bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel on Tuesday voted in favour of a revised offer by JSW Steel, turning on the heat in a contest for an asset that is being pursued by Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House, according to people directly briefed on the matter.Essar Steel: ArcelorMittal has sent a letter to Essar Steel lenders, saying it is preparing to repay dues worth Rs 4,554 crore of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron so that it could bid for Essar Steel under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy CodeUnited Spirits: Spirits major Diageo, which bought a controlling stake in Vijay Mallya’s United Spirits, will sell 30,000 sq ft of prime office space in the iconic UB Tower to DivyaSree Group in Bengaluru.ICICI Bank: The Reserve Bank of India approved Sandeep Bakhshi’s appointment as ICICI Bank managing director and CEO with effect from October 15.

Total income rose 10 per cent during the third quarter at Rs 454.22 crore, while consolidated income from operations inched up 4 per cent to Rs 425.46 crore, the company said in a statement.Among others, ACC, Cyient, DCB Bank: ACC, Cyient, DCB Bank, Mindtree and NIIT Technologies will also announce their quarterly earnings during the day.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/stock-in-news-ril-infosys-hero-motocorp-iifl-holdings/articleshow/66254546.cms
2018-10-17,"India’s largest private sector company by profit, Reliance Industries, is likely to post an 18 per cent growth in second quarter net income on Wednesday, underpinned by higher volume and prices in the petrochemical business. This would be the third quarter in a row in which the company would post double-digit earnings growth, the first time since September 2016.Consolidated net profit is expected to be Rs 9,543 crore in the September quarter, compared with Rs 8,109 crore in the year-ago period, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.Standalone profit is likely to be Rs 8,926 crore, the 15th consecutive quarter of on-year growth.The petrochemical segment, which accounts for about 44 per cent of total operating profit at RIL, is likely to show EBIT of 70 per cent YoY at Rs 8,300 crore due to higher prices of propylene, paraxylene and purified terephthalic acid (PTA). Increased utilization of newly commissioned units should also aid profits. EBITDA per ton should increase 35 per cent to Rs 10,627.Furthermore, the switch to ethane feedstock from naphtha will further support profitability. In the past two quarters, the contribution of the petrochemical segment to total operating profit was higher than that for the refinery business.The refinery segment performance could be subdued due to lower gasoline crack spread — the difference between the price of petroleum products and crude oil prices — and softer Singapore gross refining margins, a regional benchmark. Singapore GRM remained unchanged from the previous quarter’s level of $6.1 per barrel. RIL’s GRM is expected to be $10 per barrel in the September quarter, compared with $10.5 in the previous quarter.RIL’s premium to Singapore GRM is likely to come down to $3.9 per barrel in the September quarter.

2018-10-17,"Early numbers coming from the banks and NBFCs makes one think that it is business as usual, Dipan Mehta, Member, BSE &       NSE, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:What are you watching for the day, for the week, for the rest of the month?It is a busy week with so many earnings coming out as well as the fact that earnings which have already come through over yesterday and the day before also are starting to get analysed and then discounted by the market. But broadly, we are seeing that the market has created a bottom and if we see a few more trading sessions where the market stabilises around these levels of the Nifty and the Sensex, then it will bring in more confidence for the investors to start putting some of the money which has been waiting in the sidelines back into equities. So far, the earnings season has been pretty much steady and that usually is the case in the beginning of the earnings season. Better results come out in the beginning and then towards the end of the earning season the problem starts happening for the market. But by and large, it is more or less in line and hopefully the way the numbers are coming for the private sector banks and the NBFCs, we will see some more interest and confidence coming back, not only in the equity market but also in the debt market.A lot of the leaders from respective sectors have come out with their numbers. Where do you feel optimistic?We are pretty pleased with the IndusInd Bank numbers which came through and we also saw the numbers coming in from Indiabulls Housing that was also quite decent. At the same time, Delta Corp came with a very good set of numbers. In case of banks and NBFCs which I mentioned, the managements have gone out of the way to explain that growth momentum remains intact and in case of Indiabulls Housing liquidity is not an issue, it is just a matter of temporary loss of confidence and that is gradually being revived. The underlying opportunity which is there as far as retail lending is concerned remains enormous. By and large, they have been able to pass on the increases in interest costs and in both cases, the overall operating costs have remained under control. At least the early numbers coming from the banks and NBFCs makes one think that it is business as usual. There were a few wrinkles but those have been ironed off as quickly and over the next few weeks it will just be back to normal with slightly elevated interest rates. We are going to watch the NBFC and the private sector bank results because we clearly believe that if you want a revival of the bull market, then it has to be led by the bank, NBFCs and the consumption oriented stocks, including autos. I do not believe that Reliance and the tech sector and the pharma sector can take the market to new highs and continue the multi-year bull market. The focus has to be on sectors which have been driving this bull market for the past four, five years.What is your call on Delta Corp?First a disclosure that we and our clients are invested in Delta Corp and a great set of numbers came through from Delta Corp, especially on the gaming side where they reported 30-40% growth rates which they have been consistently doing over the past several quarters or so. What exactly has happened in the casino business is that the competition from the onshore casinos has reduced drastically because of higher license fees in Goa and that has benefited the offshore casinos, especially Delta which is the largest in Goa over there. At the same time, there has seen good traction in the online gaming business where although the margins are slightly at flattish levels, they have been investing extensively to grow the business and that is a good growth opportunity for the company per se. Basically Delta Corp was bang in the middle of rising domestic consumption, increased spending on entertainment, leisure, travel and they have a unique position being one of its kind listing in the Indian secondary market. At the same time, there are opportunities from newer casinos like the one opened in Sikkim and hopefully they can get the Daman casino also going. Many variables are going positive for Delta and in terms of valuation also, at reasonable levels of about 34-35 times trailing 12 months, we feel quite optimistic that over a two-three years, this company could deliver outperforming returns for investors. We remain pretty much positive but need to watch out for numbers and the biggest risk factor is any regulatory action which the state governments may take against casinos.Talking about Reliance, most analysts are going in with bullish expectations and there could be 15th consecutive quarter of a profit growth. Do you think much of the positive is already in the price? I agree that a lot of it has got priced in. They had massive expansions and all of them have more or less gone on stream and benefitted the top line as well as bottom line. Refining margins are under pressure given the kind of global scenario that they are operating in and it was petrochemical margins which drove the profits for the past quarter and they may sustain for one more quarter or so. But end of the day, whether it is refining or petrochemicals, these are basically commodity businesses and they have these cycles. Reliance has benefitted from the upcycle which has taken place in these two commodity businesses but it cannot last forever and you should expect some sort of a downturn as well. At the same time, increases in costs also will start to pressure the margins. The other growth engines that being the digital business and the retail business are still far too small to make a meaningful impact on the profitability of the company at least for the next two, three years or so. And while they create a lot of excitement within the stock but end of the day the contribution to the bottom line and earnings per share will be marginal.So given that situation, give the fact that the stock has rallied considerably over the past two, three years or so and now is quite reasonably or richly valued, I would expect the stock to at least underperform the broader indices going forward. But having said, we have been negative on Reliance for the past several months and that particular call has not worked out.I would just be a bit cautious even in this particular assessment but intuitively I do feel that going forward it is going to get very difficult for investors of Reliance to expect the same kind of returns which the company has delivered over the past two three years or so.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-tech-pharma-cant-drive-multi-year-bull-market-dipan-mehta/articleshow/66255492.cms

2018-10-18,"ET Intelligence Group: Reliance Industries, India’s largest private sector by profit, is likely to outperform given its core business segment—refining and petrochemical— stayed steady for the September quarter meeting street expectations while robust growth of the consumer-facing business—retail and RJio— would boost the stock.In the September quarter, the operating profit share of the consumer business jumped to 20 per cent of the total consolidated profit from just 4.8 per cent in the same quarter last year. Furthermore, the acquisition of the controlling stake in the Hathway and DEN Networks will help the tap the sizeable untapped broadband market.This could help boost the valuation of the RJio. RIL’s stock has outperformed the benchmark Sensex by 9 per cent in the past three months in choppy trade. Based on the September quarter results, the earnings estimate and ascribed valuation multiple for the retail business is likely to be revised upwards. This could lift the consensus target price for RIL.In its core business, the softness in the Singapore refining margin—a gauge of regional refining margin—has been reflected in the company’s refining margin, which was at $6.0 per barrel in September quarter.The gross refining margin—the difference between crude oil cost and average selling price of refining products—dropped to $9.5 per barrel in the September quarter from $10.5 in the previous quarter due to the adverse light-heavy crude differential, lower product realisation and shutdown of one unit.The premium of RIL’s GRM to the Singapore refining margin dropped $3.4 per barrel from an average premium of $4-4.5. Despite the fall in the GRM, operating profit of the refining segment grew 0.1 per cent to Rs 5,322 crore on a sequential basis thanks to higher throughput rising 7 per cent Q-o-Q to 17.7 mmt.The higher feedstock prices and lower realisation in some petrochemical products lowered profitability of the petrochemical segment and operating profit margin dropped 70 basis points on a sequential basis to 18.8 per cent. With record absolute operating profit in the September quarter, the share of the petrochemical segment to the total operating was nearly 50 per cent.There are ample growth triggers for earnings growth of the refining and petrochemical segment. RIL’s GRM is likely to improve on higher utilisation of pet coke gasification project which could potentially increase by $2-2.5 per barrel if crude prices continue to remain elevated. New International Marine Organisation rule for cleaner fuel could also improve realisation for the complex refiner.Margins of the petrochemical segment margin were impacted due to rising prices of ethane in the international market. However, RIL has hedged an undisclosed quantum of ethane purchases up to December 2020.The retail business revenue grew 25 per cent sequentially and 121 per cent on a yearly basis surprising the street. This is triple-digit growth on YoY basis for the fourth quarter running.In the first half of the FY19, the total revenue of retail business revenue reached Rs 58,326 crore and if the company maintains the current quarterly rate in the remaining of the two quarters of the current fiscal revenue may cross Rs 1 lakh crore. The street is pencilling in revenue of Rs 1 lakh crore for the next fiscal year. The street is valuing retail business for Rs 140-160 per share and valuation multiples are lower than its peers.In the September quarter, RJio added 37 million subscribers compared with 28.7 million in the previous quarter and average revenue per user dropped to Rs 131.7 from Rs 135.The trend is likely to continue as strategy precedence of customer acquisition over the margins will likely stay till it reaches critical mass in the subscriber and revenue market share. The controlling stake in cable operator for the fourth quarter for the fourth quarter and Den Network will support the penetration of the JioFibre—fibre-based broadband service. Hathway and Den Networks offer broadband services with nearly 6.5m homes and a combined broadband subscriber base of 0.9m.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jio-retail-growth-to-keep-investors-hooked-to-ril/articleshow/66268714.cms
2018-10-18,"The government move to make auto fuels cheaper by asking state-run oil companies take a hit will not impact Reliance Industries' retail fuel expansion plans, a top official has said.The official also denied notions of the company going slow on fuel retailing side.After the fuel price deregulation, especially that of diesel in September 2014, RIL, which has licence to operate 5,000 pumps, had begun to reopen the shut pumps in a phased manner and so far it has re-commissioned only 512 of them, much slower than the rivals like Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil which operates over 3,500 pumps now) and Shell.Reliance was forced to shut down its retailing business following the sharp increase in under-recoveries following the spike in global crude prices since 2011.""In a broader sense, I don't think it (the forced price reduction) is going to affect what we are planning to do in terms of our fuel retail expansion. I don't think we are going to let this alter our strategy in terms of what we are doing,"" V Srikanth, the joint group chief financial officer of the company, told reporters Wednesday evening.He, however, conceded that the company will have to cut the retail price due to competitive pressures.It can be noted that along with a reduction in the Excise duty to the tune of Rs 1.5 a liter, government had early October also asked the state-run oil marketing companies which have a dominate share of the fuel retailing market to take a hit of Re 1 on every litre of diesel and petrol.Many BJP-ruled states followed suit with cut in VAT, to minimise the pinch of the rise in oil prices on commoners.Sriknath said RIL's dependence on the oil retailing is very minimal, stating that only up to 5 per cent of its refining output of over 60 million tone is consumed in the domestic market and therefore, the impact from an overall numbers perspective is ""very small"".When asked if the company is going slow on retail expansion, he denied so, saying the perception may be ""in the context of some"" rivals but his company is moving as per its retailing plans.He said RIL had signed an agreement with British oil major BP on the fuel retailing front, but it has not been enforced on the ground as it may be lacking in specifics.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ril-forced-price-cut-has-no-impact-on-oil-retailing-plans/articleshow/66274652.cms

2018-10-18,"NEW DELHI: Crude oil prices will remain high in the near term, while petrol supply will increase globally, which will reduce the profit a refiner makes from producing fuel, Reliance Industries, which runs the world’s biggest refining complex at Jamnagar, said.However, medium-term refining margins will be supported by the global growth in demand and much tougher emission norms for the shipping industry that come into force from 2020, the conglomerate said late on Wednesday in a presentation to analysts after reporting a 17.5% rise in consolidated net profit for the July-September quarter.It said the business faced headwinds from the US-China trade tensions, currency depreciation in emerging markets and higher price of oil. Also, fewer planned maintenance shutdowns of units globally, would increase the refinery runs, it said.It said gasoline cracks, or the difference between the price of crude oil and petrol, may be under pressure because of lower refinery turnaround and ramp up or new capacity. However, products like jet fuel, kerosene and diesel, which are called middle distillates in oil parlance, would be more profitable to produce because of low inventory at the main trading hubs and strong demand because of firm economic outlook and seasonal heating demands.Global oil demand growth is expected to be 1.3 million barrels a day in 2018 and 1.4 million in the following calendar year. Refinery capacity addition is estimated at 800,000 barrels per day this year and 1.5 million barrels a day in 2019. Crude oil market would be tightly supplied. “Increasing risk of reduced Iranian exports and limited spare capacity to keep crude price elevated in near term,” it said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/oil-refiners-profit-will-fall-on-high-crude-prices-ril/articleshow/66278394.cms

The contribution from expansions and robust downstream margins should drive RIL’s EBITDA growth of 27 per cent CAGR FY18-20,” said Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank has revised target price by about 2 per cent to Rs 1,270 due to rolling forward of valuations by six months.Credit Suisse said that while refining business looks challenged in the near term, petrochemicals business looks stable and the consumer businesses are scaling up well.Credit Suisse is bullish on the stock as it offers a combination of large cash generating businesses and highgrowth consumer ones.

2018-10-19,"KOLKATA|NEW DELHI: The days of the ordinary feature phone are numbered with consumers rapidly upgrading to 4G feature phones, led by the JioPhone, that offer a much richer data and video experience, forcing plain vanilla handset makers to review their production plans.CyberMedia Research (CMR) data shows that market share of 2G phones has plunged 17 percentage points in just six months to 30% in the quarter ended June, while Reliance Retail’s 4G variant, called JioPhone, increased its market share by 9 percentage points in the same period to 27%. “This signals the beginning of the ordinary feature phones category becoming unviable,” said Sanjay Kapoor, former chief executive, Bharti Airtel.The scenario would be accelerated with GPRS and Edge also becoming defunct technologies, he told ET. Counterpoint Research estimates market share of 2G featurephones will drop to 25% by the first quarter of 2019 and crash below 10% by 2021.Rapid expansion in the share of JioPhones has, in fact, grown the overall feature phone segment at the cost of the low-cost smartphone. Analysts expect handset makers to phase out 2G feature phones sooner than later and focus on 4G featurephones as telcos turn attention to data and content delivery to boost their revenues. Or, they risk losing their user base to JioPhone, analysts said. HMD Global, the Finnish maker of Nokia devices, has already entered the 4G feature phone market. Indian handset maker Lava too plans to make 4G feature phones.Micromax and Karbonn, domestic handset makers that have been major players in the 2G basic phone segment, are reviewing their 2G feature phone production plans and brand portfolios at a time when Jio’s 4G feature phone has emerged the largestselling phone in the sub- Rs 1,500 range.Micromax cofounder Vikas Jain said sales volumes of ordinary feature phones “have definitely been impacted, and the company would review its 2G devices portfolio and focus on 4G feature phones and smartphones” if 2G device users want a stronger data experience. He expects “almost the entire ordinary handset market to go 4G in the next 12-18 months if the cost gap between an ordinary and LTE featurephone can be bridged with support from carriers.”Shashin Devsare, executive director, Karbonn Mobiles, said handset vendors “would strengthen entry-level smartphones portfolio as the 2G feature phones pie will keep falling”.But handset sector barons said an issue holding up mass 4G feature phone production is the manufacturing cost of such a device, which is 3-to-4 times more than an ordinary 2G phone. Matching the JioPhone price point, they said, would be next to impossible as that device is heavily subsidised, and would accordingly, require handset makers to partner with telcos to produce a 4G LTE feature phone that is competitive against Jio’s feature phone offer.“Since the operator is heavily subsidising cost of the 4G LTE featurephone in the India market, we are left with no option but to partner with a telco in this segment,” Sunil Raina, president at Lava International, told ET without directly naming Jio. Lava, he said, is looking “to deliver 4G-enabled featurephones through strategic tie-ups with operators”.CLSA expects Reliance Jio Infocomm to have some 462 million customers by March 2021, of which 40% are likely to be JioPhone users. Jio’s latest offer of exchanging any old featurephone for a basic JioPhone for around Rs 1,000, including recharge, has been an absolute killer for the 2G device segment, analysts said.Jain said mass production of a JioPhone-like device “would require a carrier partner to make the value proposition suitable to the end consumer both from the device and 4G tariff points of view,” adding Micromax is in talks “to partner with either incumbents or Jio” to manufacture a 4G LTE featurephone.Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence group (IIG) at media services group CyberMedia Research (CMR), said handset makers would require “economies of scale with adequate telco support to match JioPhone’s pricing”.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-4g-revolution-may-render-the-2g-featurephone-extinct/articleshow/66288079.cms
2018-10-22,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel’s non-mobile businesses, which generate more than a 10th of its India revenue, are under threat after Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries acquired controlling stakes in two national cable TV operators, which may spur the rollout of its telecom arm’s countrywide home broadband service.The buyout of DEN Networks and Hathway Cables will give Reliance Jio Infocomm “a headstart” in the ultra-fast fibre-to-home service turf, which “we see as a real threat to Bharti’s non-mobile businesses —namely, home broadband and digital TV — which garner as much as 12 per cent of Bharti’s India revenues, excluding Bharti Infratel revenues,” brokerage Credit Suisse said in a note seen by ET.The home broadband and digital TV businesses, it said, generate as much as 17 per cent of Airtel’s India operating income, excluding tower company Bharti Infratel’s contribution. Reliance acquired 66 per cent and 51.3 per cent stakes in DEN Networks and Hathway Cables, respectively, in deals aggregating Rs 5,230 crore last week, when Jio reported its fourth straight profitable quarter, with an 11.3 per cent sequential growth in earnings to Rs 681 crore in July-September.The Swiss brokerage said Jio’s parent Reliance will overnight “gain access to 24 million cable homes and leapfrog Bharti’s modest 2.1 million fixed-line homes, very few of which have fibre connectivity.” Almost 16 million out of the 24 million cable homes are in the top 100 cities.Kotak Institutional Equities said it would be difficult for Airtel’s DTH arm (Airtel Digital TV) to counter Jio’s combination of wired broadband and internet TV services and hold on to its home service users, although it expects DTH operator Tata Sky to be hit harder, given Airtel’s strength in the urban markets. Airtel did not reply to ET’s queries as of press time.Airtel’s India business posted a loss, before exceptional items, of RS 940.4 crore in the quarter ended June amid mounting pricing pressure, compared with a profit of almost Rs 835 crore a year earlier. Ahead of the launch of Jio’s home broadband service — GigaFiber — Airtel had reduced prices, which shrank its home service revenue 14 per cent on-year for the quarter ended June 30.Sunil Mittal-led Airtel has been revving up its pan-India wired broadband act to protect turf ahead of Jio’s GigaFiber service. It is said to have set aside a chunk of its Rs 24,000-crore spending planned in this financial year to expand its home broadband network to at least 100 key cities, targeting big data consumption zones. The telco plans to connect another 10 million-plus homes by FY21.Analysts expect that access to a combination of 24 million cable homes and 252 million 4G mobile broadband customers would give Reliance Jio more bargaining power in content negotiations with broadcasters.However, Jio has faced resistance from some local cable operators (LCOs) in getting crucial access to homes in key markets. LCOs provide cable TV feed from DEN and Hathway to homes. Kotak said getting access to 27,000-odd LCOs is the prime driver of Reliance’s DEN/Hathway acquisitions.“Last-mile reach to homes is still tightly controlled by LCOs who can be nuisance value for anyone trying to get into these homes. Jio said as much when it indirectly indicated ‘accelerated FTTH rollout’ as the strategic driver behind this acquisition,” the brokerage said.Brokerage Nomura does not expect Jio’s estimated home broadband spending of $120-140 per home to reduce drastically as “the last-mile network infrastructure of DEN and Hathway will need to be upgraded.”Ambani had unveiled Jio’s Giga-Fiber home broadband service plans in July, targeting 50 million homes across 1,100 cities.

2018-10-23,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has given Reliance Communications (RCom) time till December 15 to pay Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson its dues of Rs 550 crore, plus interest, bringing relief to the Anil Ambani-owned telco.“The bench told RCom that keeping in mind the difficulties they were facing in their asset sale, an extension till December 15 will be given but the operator will have to pay Ericsson by then,” said senior counsel Anil Kher, who along with senior counsel Dushyant Dave, represented Ericsson on Tuesday.A two-judge bench of Justices RF Nariman and Abdul Nazeer said this was the last time extension would be given to the operator. Also, RCom has to pay a simple interest of 12% on the principal amount for each day’s delay beyond September 30.The court was hearing a legal dispute between Ericsson and RCom over non-payment of Rs 550 crore by September 30, the stipulated period. RCom had filed for a 60-day extension to the deadline both in the Supreme Court and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which had overseen the settlement between the telco and Ericsson.Ericsson had even filed a contempt petition against RCom chairman Anil Ambani for non-payment of dues on time, despite a personal guarantee. The apex court will hear the contempt petition after December 15.RCom, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, told the apex court that they were yet to get the approval from the Department of Telecommunications for the spectrum sale, which was the main hurdle in the asset sale plan.Dave told the bench that RCom was only raising the “bogey” of DoT clearance to avoid paying. “This bogey of DoT approval is being raised to avoid paying the money. They have already sold assets worth thousands of crores.”Dave was reacting to Sibal’s submissions that RCom was yet to get any payment from Jio.“Jio has not given us a penny. We are waiting for DoT to give us the NOC for the sale of assets,” Sibal said. He promised payment within a week of DoT nod. Sibal was assisted by advocate Mahesh Agrawal.Justice Nariman gave RCom a last chance to make the payment.The telecom department in a separate legal tussle with the Anil Ambani-owned telco had said it will not give approval to RCom’s spectrum sale to Jio, unless RCom furnishes bank guarantees worth Rs 2,947.68 crore to cover for spectrum usage charges.RCom got relief from the telecom tribunal, which rejected DoT’s pleas for bank guarantees, but DoT is expected to challenge this order and take the fight to the Supreme Court, which could further delay the deal closure.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/supreme-court-grants-reliance-communications-till-dec-15-to-pay-ericsson/articleshow/66329050.cms
2018-10-23,"NEW DELHI: Isha Ambani may have been known as Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani's daughter a few years ago. But the Ivy League graduate, who turns 27 today, has now carved her niche. The only girl in the Ambani brood - she has two brothers, Akash and Anant, while uncle Anil has two sons - Isha was her grandfather Dhirubhai Ambani's favourite. Reportedly, the Reliance patriarch would start his day and consume food or tea only after looking at her picture. After finishing school, the Ambani heiress left for Yale where she received her undergraduate degree in Psychology and South Asian studies. In 2008, she was ranked second on Forbes' 'Youngest Billionaire Heiresses' list.Isha with mom Nita Ambani at an event in 2007.It was while Isha was still at Yale that she originally gave dad Mukesh the idea behind setting up Jio. Ambani recently revealed that the idea was first seeded by his daughter in 2011 when she was home for the holidays. He said that it was Isha and Akash who convinced him that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be behind.As a 20 year-old senior at Yale, Isha made her society debut at the glamorous le Bal des Debutantes in Paris. On November 24, 2012, India's richest man Mukesh Ambani presented his daughter at the Hotel de Crillon - the luxury hotel that has been the venue of the Ball for the past two decades. While Isha opted for a Christian Dior gown, Mukesh Ambani - who reportedly took a crash course in ballroom dancing and etiquette - was dressed in a bandgala, and mum Nita kept it traditional in a saree.She went on to work as a business analyst with McKinsey & Company in New York after Yale. In October 2014, she was inducted into the boards of directors of Jio and Reliance Retail.The young scion, who's had academics high on her list, went on to do her MBA from Stanford University. While business runs in her genes, Isha also chose to follow in mother Nita's footsteps during her time at the Ivy League school, taking out time from learning the intricacies of business and management to teach. Isha took up a job at the Stanford nursery, Bing, as a teacher. Education has always been close to Nita Ambani's heart. She founded, and runs the Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai, and used to teach in a school before getting married.But it's not just business that keeps this heiress busy. In 2017, she made a stunning debut at one of New York's brightest events - the Met Gala - in a gold Dior gown.On the personal front, she recently got engaged to beau Anand Piramal in a lavish bash at Lake Como.

2018-10-24,"Reliance Industries (RIL) has begun talks to acquire a controlling stake in GTPL Hathway, a leading multi-system-operator (MSO) that dominates the Gujarat market, said people with knowledge of the matter. This follows the announcement of plans by RIL to acquire a majority interest in two of India’s largest cable TV and broadband services providers — Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks.“After Hathway and DEN, RIL believes it makes sense to acquire strong regional MSOs, and GTPL is the first such company with strong financials and clean books,” said one of the people cited above. RIL and GTPL Hathway didn’t respond to queries. Hathway owns 37.3 per cent of GTPL Hathway. Through the acquisition of a 51.3 per cent stake in Hathway for Rs 2,940 crore, RIL gets an indirect 19 per cent stake in GTPL Hathway.“Already, because of Hathway, RIL has got almost 20 per cent stake in the company,” said the person cited above. “The talks are in initial stages and the announcement will be after the open offer.” In accordance with the rules, RIL has announced an open offer for up to 25.64 per cent of Hathway at a price of Rs 82.65 per share, aggregating to a total consideration of Rs 238.37 crore. The move will further boost Mukesh Ambani’s ambitious JioGigaFiber that aims to connect 50 million homes across 1,100 cities.“Common understanding is that not many shareholders would want to subscribe to the open offer, especially now that RIL is involved,” said another person aware of the development. “So, after the open offer, RIL will make the final offer to pick up majority stake in GTPL Hathway.”GTPL Hathway has 7.6 million active digital cable subscribers in India. It has a 67 per cent market share in Gujarat with over 4 million subscribers. It is No. 2 in West Bengal with a 24 per cent market share. It is present in over 500 cities in 11 states and works with 20,000 local cable operators.As of June 30, GTPL Hathway’s broadband subscriber base was 290,000 with a 1.5 million homepass, or homes where it could potentially offer such connections.Its net average revenue per user (ARPU) from the broadband business is at Rs 465. The company posted revenue of Rs 1,113.4 crore and net profit of Rs 61.4 crore in the financial year ended March.On October 17, RIL said it will invest Rs 2,940 crore in Hathway for 51.3 per cent stake and Rs 2,290 crore in DEN for a 66 per cent holding.

2018-10-24,"NBFCs play an incredibly important role in the system and those which have an advantage in terms of retail       distribution and better management practices, have a long way to go, Shailesh R Bhan, Deputy CEO, Reliance Capital AM, tells Ajaya Sharma of ET Now, at an exclusive interview at the sidelines of the Morningstar conference.Edited excerpts: Nifty is down 12-13% on a year till date basis and in the broader markets -- smallcap and midcap -- the damage has been 40-50%. As a fund house. how are you approaching this bearish phase in the market if you will?After a very strong outperformance, the markets have corrected. Between 2013 and 2017, there was a very big run rate. After that, in pockets of the market, valuations had gone into very expensive zones, especially the small and midcap places where we have seen a pullback. Generally good quality businesses which were rationally valued have done well even in this environment and hence the differential. Two years back, the talk was midcaps outperforming largecaps and the premium to their valuations was 20, 30, 40% higher. Now that has given away. So, the distortion which was there in terms of relative valuations of largecaps and midcaps has corrected. Our approach is simple. From a three-year point of view, we are studying which kind of businesses have an earnings momentum, are directionally seeing an improving operating environment and how supportive are the tailwinds for those companies. That is our construct for investing. We continue to believe that the largecap space is still rational and over a three-year period provides a good opportunity. Over a period of time, people can look at other spaces as well but at the moment given elections and given the volatility, the largecap or multi cap space is a better space to be in.The latest letdown in the market was triggered by a liquidity crunch in the system and NBFCs sold off big time and were followed by all financials. Which are the companies from the NBFC space you think will survive the shock and which are the ones which may fall by the wayside?NBFCs had a very good run in the last three, four years, you had other challenges in the banking sector which created a very good runway for non-banking finance companies to lend and grow. In that phase, there were many companies with strong capabilities doing exceedingly well and companies with average capabilities getting a good reward in the market. It was kind of a semi bubble in NBFC companies at that point of time. Now after things have changed and easy money is not available to lend, you will find companies with significant retail presence, who have strong credit processes that can handle the volatility in the credit market. Those sets of businesses are very well placed. NBFCs play an incredibly important role in the system and those which are able to have an advantage in terms of retail distribution, better management practices and all that, have a long way to go. Companies which were just an arbitrage will be challenged. So, retail driven franchises with reasonable ability to manage liabilities are doing very well.Are you still saying that the structural story is intact?NBFCs are needed in places where banks cannot reach. India is a large country and there are a lot of products where banks have not reached because it takes that much time to penetrate and do that risk profiling of customers.There was a huge window which did not have traditional banking. The NBFCs had a significant role to play and they still have a granular significant role to play. Wherever there was lazy banking, NBFCs had an advantage and reached out to the customers.There are still a lot of places where credit is required where now you have tools also to monitor and manage, retrieve and handle the whole process. Those sets of businesses have a good long-term opportunity.You have seen several corrections and boom phases. How much pain is there and how many months could this last in your view?You have seen a four, five-year, substantially elongated run and some of this run was also on the back of strong earnings in certain sectors which were given significant valuation by the market players. The market actually was in some sense split into two pockets; one segment of the market being overvalued for the growth they were delivering and other pocket was undervalued because there was no momentum in that spaces.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/good-opportunity-in-largecaps-over-next-three-years-shailesh-r-bhan-reliance-capital-am/articleshow/66345190.cms

The vessel is powered by twin diesel engines and can move at a speed of 20 knots,"" said Bir.He said RNEL at present is constructing 20 ships of three different categories for the defence services of the country.""These projects include five naval offshore patrol vessels and 14 fast patrol vessels, apart from the training ship launched today. Of this, six vessels are expected to be delivered in 2019,"" the CEO added.Expressing concern about company's low orderbook, Bir urged the defence forces to ""support"" the firm by giving more orders.""Reliance Naval has the largest shipbuilding facility in India. The shipyard has an installed throughput of 140,000 tonne of steel, equivalent to an annual revenue of a minimum Rs 4,000 crore,"" he said.""The shipyard presently has a meagre order book of Rs 4,000 crore, which does not justify the huge capital investment in building this most modern shipyard,"" added Bir.Rajendra Singh, director general of the Indian Coast Guard, also expressed confidence that the training ship will be delivered in May 2019.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/reliance-naval-launches-training-ship-for-indian-coast-guard/articleshow/66348299.cms
2018-10-25,"Dassault Aviation CEO, Éric Trappier spoke exclusively to Manu Pubby of The Economic Times, where he cleared the air regarding various controversial questions ranging from the choice of Reliance as a partner for the joint venture to the deal itself.Rafale deal controversy relates to the purchase of 36 multi-role fighter aircraft by the Indian Defence Ministry from France’s Dassault Aviation.Here's what Éric Trappier said during the interview:*Basic premise of Dassault giving Rs 30,000 crore worth of offset contracts to Reliance is totally unfounded and untrue as it was a joint venture with each company contributing its respective shares. He said Dassult is helping Reliance with capital for them to manufacture parts of the aircraft*Dassault holds a 49% stake bringing in its 90 years of aerospace manufacturing experience, making it the “most qualified vendor”.*On Former French President François Hollande's statement that it was compulsory to sign up with Reliance to get the contract for the aircraft Trappier said, Mr Hollande offered a clarification that the two firms chose each other mutually and nobody was coerced into signing the deal.*He also categorically stated that there was no push from the Indian government to chose Reliance as its partner.*On the question of pricing, he said that the pricing was in the hands of the French government. He said that the deal is clean and they were open to any kind of investigation if it falls within the ambit of French laws.In January 2016, India confirmed an order of 36 Rafale jets in a government to government contract. Dassault and its main partners - engine-maker Safran and electronic systems-maker Thales - will share some technology with DRDO and some private sector companies and HAL under the offsets clause.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/dassault-did-not-give-rs-30000-crore-worth-of-offset-contracts-to-reliance-ric-trappier/articleshow/66363142.cms
2018-10-26,"Dassault Aviation CEO, Éric Trappier spoke exclusively to Manu Pubby of The Economic Times, where he said that Dassault was selected in 2012, but had not been able to finalise the HAL deal even in 2015. It was difficult to agree on who will take responsibility for the aircraft, Dassault or HAL, Trappier said.Edited excerpts: The opposition has been alleging that Rs 30,000 cr offsets have been gifted to Reliance Defence for the Rafale deal. Is this true?It is totally untrue. We have a partnership with Reliance that started in 2011. We have been a partner to India for the past 65 years. We want to set up facilities because India wishes to develop its own industry and be a global player. We were looking for private partners to transfer our knowhow and manufacturing to India.We partnered Reliance because it was able to give us facilities and some knowhow about the country while I am the one who knows how to produce the Falcon. We signed an MoU in February 2012 (with the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group), around the same time the Rafale emerged as a winner (in India), and we have continued to work together. My purpose is and was to meet full offset obligations, to set up facilities and to make my own supply chain for the Falcon.What about the question on Rs 30,000 cr offsets to Reliance Defence?In line with our share, we have invested 49% in the joint venture with a capital of Rs 70 crore. We will gradually increase the capital in the JV. Our plan is to increase this figure to Rs 850 cr. So, my investment of about Rs 425 crore (49%) will be over five years.It has nothing to do with the big figures I have been hearing. As per the rules of offsets, the contract was government-to-government and at the same time Dassault signed a contract for offset as per the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2013. There was a value to the offsets.The JV will produce parts of Falcon and maybe, one day a complete Falcon 2000 at Mihan. We will get some credits for offsets. Today, if I take the number of deals with different companies, I already have 40% of the obligations covered with 30 companies.One of these is the (Reliance) JV which is 10% of the 40%.But, the JV has said in press releases it is a key partner in the Rs 30,000 cr offsets?What is important is what we are going to do. It is to produce the Falcon, its parts and parts of Rafale. For me, it is key as I need to transfer to this JV the capacity to produce to western standards. We need to have the right quality to be a global company. It is key because the JV is going to become a global aeronautical company that is founded from scratch.So, which are the rest of the companies that will be doing the offsets for Rafale?We have a list, the job continues as we are in discussion with over a 100 companies. Thirty of these have already been signed up. They are in Bangalore, in Mumbai, in Pune, all over the country.There has been a lot of confusion and talk on former President Francois Hollande’s statement that the partnership with Reliance was compulsory for the deal?It is very simple, Mr Hollande has himself clarified that the two companies partnered on their own.We found Reliance in 2011-12. This was not at the time of Hollande and not at the time of your incumbent PM. We have been in talks with Reliance for a long ime. I want to make it clear that Dassault Aviation is a partner as the Ambanis are a very respectable family. The two brothers and their mother are well-known in India. We are a family-owned company and we feel comfortable with another family-owned company.Was there any pressure or push from the Indian side on choosing Reliance for the offsets?Not at all. The rules of the Defence Procurement Policy says that the choice of offset partner belongs to the contractor.The French have nothing to say about the choice of partners in India. When I choose a partner it becomes my responsibility to fulfil the obligations, to quality standards and timing. I made the choice.Has India paid a lot more for the 36 Rafale jets than what it would have paid for the previously negotiated contract?There is a mix-up here. I don’t want to disclose the information on the pricing but what I can say is that we had a proposal earlier for 126 aicraft. This was based in two parts. First was for 18 aircraft in flyaway condition and the second was for the production of 108 aircraft which included tools, jigs, manhours and documentation.The unit price for the 18 flyaway Rafales was what was given to the government. The support (spare parts) was changed to adapt to 36. Then, we started negotiations with MoD. The pricing was kept very low and there was also a rebate of 9% on the total price.If it was double the price, I would have been sent back to France without any contract. Compared to the same (UPA) price, India brought down the cost by 9%. Where is the confusion? Apple to apple, the comparison is between the 18 and 36 flyaway jets.Were you surprised that the number of aircraft to be bought were brought down to 36 from 126?That was part of the (Indian) decision. We were very firm on getting the deal for 126 planes and we had discussions with HAL as it was the lead production agency. For some reasons, the deal did not go through.What was the problem?We were selected in 2012 and even in 2015 we had not been able to finalise the deal. I will not say why in details but it was difficult to cope with different requirements.One was who will take the final responsibility for the aircraft, Dassault or HAL?I had said that for the first few aircraft it should be Dassault and then it should be HAL. We had an excellent relationship with HAL and we had many discussion but for some reason it did not go through.Then, if I understand there was an urgent requirement of the IAF and India requested France to supply the aircraft and finalised the deal for 36 Rafales.In the Rafale deal, corruption complaints have been filed with the CBI and representations have also been made to the Supreme Court. Are you open to an investigation into the contract?Since 2000, there has been a strong international law on anti-corruption in France and we stick to it. We stick to the laws of France and the laws of India and the law of the contract. We are totally against corruption. If there is any investigation in France or India, we are not only open to the investigation, it is our duty (to respond). We will prove that there is no corruption. We are open, we are engineers and we want to be in India.We want to develop capabilities in India not only for manufacturing but for design and development. There are many opportunities and we are really enthusiastic to be in India.That is why I am just a little bit sad about the controversy. For me, I am very enthusiastic to be in India, to set up the partnership with Indian companies and our teams are committed to it.Do you think that signing the deal for 36 jets gives you an advantage for two upcoming contracts for 110 fighter to be made in India and a Naval requirement of 57 jets?The IAF had done a complete evaluation of different competitors that included the F/A 18, the Gripen, the Eurofighter as well as the Russian jet and among them, the Rafale was judged the best.So, it does give us an advantage. The other advantage is that in the deal for 36 jets, the training of pilots, mechanics and support will already be in place.I will fight to try to get both contracts because Rafale is capable of aircraft carrier operations. It could be a competition between us and the US but we have a very good product. The French forces decided from the start to have an aircraft capable of both land-based and aircraft carrier operations. The Rafale will give India real superiority in the air.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-deal-there-was-no-pressure-from-indian-side-on-choosing-reliance-says-dassault-ceo/articleshow/66371524.cms
2018-10-26,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik has cancelled the Group Mediclaim Health Insurance Scheme for employees in the state, the contract for which was awarded to Anil Ambani’s Reliance General Insurance.Malik, while talking to a news channel, said that the contract has been cancelled as it was ‘full of fraud’ and its implementation was erroneous. He even informed that the tenders were opened ‘secretly on a holiday to suit a particular company.’The governor’s office had rolled out the scheme last month, which was immediately criticised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and others.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said that a proper investigation should follow the cancellation of the contract and the guilty must be exposed.“The Hon J&K governor now needs to order an inquiry headed by the chief secretary to establish who was behind the allotment of the insurance contract. The sums of money involved are too big for this to have been a straight forward mistake,” Abdullah tweeted.Last month, the J&K government had issued the order stating that the policy has been tied with M/s Reliance General Health Insurance Company Ltd on an annual premium of Rs 8,777 and Rs 22,229 (for employees and pensioners respectively). After initial criticism over awarding of contract, Reliance General Insurance also issued a statement claiming that the company won the contract after a “rigorous and transparent competitive tender process”.The scheme was mandatory for government employees, autonomous bodies and universities and optional for pensioners and accredited journalists and other category of employees. The scheme was challenged in the J&K High Court as well.The employees union in the state had also criticised the scheme saying that the policy was being imposed on employees.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jammu-kashmir-governor-satyapal-singh-scraps-health-cover-deal-with-reliance-insurance/articleshow/66371778.cms
2018-10-26,"After discussion in 2011, an MOU was signed between Reliance and Dassault in 2012, Eric Trappier, CEO, Dassault Aviation, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: The Opposition says that Rs 30,000 crore given by Dassault to Reliance as a JV partner has been gifted to them. What is your take on that?No, it is totally untrue. We have a joint venture, Dassault Reliance Aerospace.   We are funding Reliance to become a company that manufactures parts of Falcon and Rafale. The capital today is about Rs 70 crore, 49% is supported by Dassault and 51% supported by Reliance. What Dassault has already given as the capital of the company is 49% of Rs 70 crore. It is going to be upgraded step by step in order to have the right capital for operating the company. This will go up to Rs 850 crore, half funded by Dassault and half by Reliance. It has nothing to do with the big figures that we are hearing.There is a lot of confusion also on the statement of ex President Francois Mr Hollande that it was compulsory to sign up with Reliance to get the contract for the aircraft?Yes, Mr Hollande corrected his wording or clarified his wording and said that the two partners have found each other by themselves.

2018-10-27,"When he spoke at the India Mobile Congress in New Delhi on October 25, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani sounded more like a tech evangelist envisioning an India in 2020 where everyone has 4G phones in their hands and the industry was ready for the next generation of telecom technologies. He spoke about a “new world”, a “new India” and “new commerce”. He might as well have mentioned a new Reliance, too. For it is highly likely that by 2020, Reliance, India’s largest private company by market cap, may have to be classified principally as a tech and consumer play, and not a refiner or a petrochem producer. A week earlier on October 18, Reliance’s financial results for the July-September quarter was announced (54.5% jump in revenues and 17.4% jump in profits over the corresponding quarter of 2017); and if one takes a close look at the segment revenues, it appears that a significant shift is underway at Reliance. For the first time, newer businesses like organised retail, digital services and media have brought in more combined revenues (Rs 44,615 cr) than the highly profitable petrochem business (Rs 43,745 cr). At Reliance Industries, the refining and marketing business, which produces and sells petrol, diesel, LPG, kerosene, naphtha and similar products by refining crude oil, brings in the largest chunk of revenue — Rs 98,760cr, around half of the turnover. A big chunk of these products are exported. Petrochemicals (polyesters, polymers, synthetic fibres and other products) used to be the next big block, and even now rakes in the most in profits. The new businesses such as organised retail, telecom and media are consumerfacing service businesses that are very different from the traditional RIL — primarily a business-to-business industrial conglomerate. The group entered these new businesses in the last decade. “This is definitely a significant development. To a great extent all these happened under the radar. People still focus on the refining and petrochem business of Reliance. Only recently have they started talking about Jio. Retail even today continues to remain out of focus for the analyst community,” says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, markets commentator and chairman of Inditrade Capital. Along with the quarterly results, the company had also announced the acquisition of cable and internet companies DEN and Hathway, as well as its investment in US-based personal transportation company SkyTran. Ambani clearly wants to bet on mass consumer plays and new technologies over the next decade. Bandyopadhyay says within three years, the way Reliance Industries is valued will change as the newer businesses, especially organised retail, telecom and digital offerings, grow fast and notch up higher revenues. In fact in its current configuration, RIL presents a problem for analysts. Not just Reliance, other diversified companies such as ITC Ltd or Piramal Enterprises also often have this problem of being assessed on the basis of the existing businesses. “Reliance should be valued by a team of analysts with experience in different sectors, led by a senior analyst who would take a view on the stock,” says Vinod Sharma, head of capital markets strategy and the private clients group at HDFC Securities. Most brokerage analysts maintain a hold or buy recommendation on the RIL stock. Much of Reliance’s investments in the new areas have been fuelled by debt, and the increasing debt on its books has sparked some concern. Outstanding debt on September 30, 2018, stood at Rs 2,58,701 crore. JP Morgan India said in a report dated October 18 that while the company had recorded strong growth, the markets would still focus on high capital expenditure (Rs 39,000 crore for the quarter), high debt (Rs 42,500 crore additional borrowing since March 2018) and the delay in commissioning of the pet-coke gasifier. ICICI Securities said in a report dated October 19 that the concerns for the company outweigh the positives right now. The retail and telecom plays were among the positives and worries mostly were around the older businesses, linked to their price cycles, and high debt and investments. The debt and investments have pushed huge growth in the new businesses. Organised retail business with revenues of Rs 32,436 crore for the July-September quarter is the largest in India. It has shown a 121.5% growth over the corresponding quarter last year, and 25.3% over the immediately preceding quarter. Similarly, the digital services business, that would include the Reliance Jio telecom and digital financial and content offerings, have grown at more than 50% over the yearago period. Sharma of HDFC Securities says the rerating of the company, as a tech and consumer play, though on the cards, will be a gradual process that will happen over the next few years. He adds that a lot will depend on how soon the company tones down its investment spree. He says investments at a rate around half of the current amount would help the process.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/why-mukesh-ambani-led-ril-needs-to-be-viewed-as-a-tech-and-consumer-player/articleshow/66395674.cms

2018-10-29,"ET Intelligence Group: The picture looks bleaker as India Inc reaches the middle of the current (June-September) results season. A sample of 236 companies excluding banks and finance companies reported a robust 26.7 per cent year-on-year growth in net sales for the September 2018 quarter. Despite this, the performance does not instil confidence since it is largely driven by a strong show from the information technology (IT) sector and upbeat numbers from Reliance Industries (RIL), the country’s petroleum refining giant which also runs a rapidly growing telecom venture.In addition, notwithstanding their double-digit bottom line growth, the sample’s net profit grew just 3.5 per cent, reflecting weakness in the broader profitability.The 27 IT companies and RIL together contributed 54.1 per cent to the sample’s revenue, the highest in 13 quarters. They also formed 59.8 per cent of the aggregate net profit, the highest in 11 quarters. Without their contribution, the sample’s net profit would have fallen by 12.2 per cent, a first in nine quarters, whereas net sales would have increased at a slower rate of 15.4 per cent.Other major sectors that reported double-digit sales and net profit growth were auto ancillary, capital goods, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), and pharmaceuticals.

From our perspective, stocks like SBI at current valuation even after today’s good move should be the one that investors should consider buying because you are getting a stock at less than 1.1 price to book, with the kind of NPA closure like the Essar deal happening. A large amount of recoveries are happening and we clearly see some kind of improvement in the profitability of such companies going forward. Private sector banks which have a high amount of CASA, banks like SBI as well as some of the bellwethers like Reliance, should be the kind of stocks that one should be consider investing in at current market levels.It is interesting to see that you are betting on capital goods space because government capex is set to increase. But what about private capex? Which are the capital goods companies where IFFL is betting big?In a rising interest rate scenario, you are likely to see a large amount of companies getting into bidding aggressively. When you look at only quality names, a company like L&T stand out. It gets benefits from Middle East business as oil prices go up. On the domestic business side, they have been focussing on more on EPC and not too much on businesses which require a large amount of capital.In terms of valuation, the stock is currently trading at 20x. Seven-eight years back, it used to trade at least at 25-30% premium over the Sensex because the ROE of the company was close to around 35-40%. Going forward, we believe that since we are in an election year, we are going to see an improvement in overall capex cycle.In terms of private capex, there are clearly challenges in terms of liquidity. But having said that, the utilisation rate across a lot of sectors being close to around 100%, we see many companies not being able to go up from the current levels. As a result, a lot of companies are going to get into the capex mode and for that reason, some of the companies like Larsen & Toubro should do well going forward.Mphasis and Mindtree are your top buy picks in midcap IT. A depreciating currency does not necessarily augur well for margins. What makes you so bullish on Mindtree and Mphasis and not TCS and Infosys?We continue to be quite bullish on Infosys, in addition to Mindtree and Mphasis. The core which one needs to look at in addition to currency is digitisation, where companies like Mindtree seems to have a significant advantage over other companies. In fact, we have seen recently that growth in their top 10 customers seems to have improved a lot . They had challenge on one particular account which has now been resolved and going forward, the growth trajectory in most of these companies is going to be around 18-19%. If you are getting companies at less than Nifty multiple over the next two years with a strong visibility of earnings, considering that the US BFSI segment is improving relative to what it was two years back in addition to the tailwinds of currency, then there is still a case to buy midcap IT and not just focus on the currency parameter. Organic growth even for the core business of a lot of companies in the sector also seems to be improving a lot. For that reason, it makes sense to continue to own these stocks, especially after the correction in last two months.What are you factoring in for BPCL and how are you looking at the overall earnings trajectory?In case of refineries, our view has completely changed in last one month post the government decision to take some amount of subsidy from these companies. Having said that these stocks whenever they are available at less than 1X price to book historically over last 20 years. we have seen these stocks give a return of at least 40% from those levels.If one has bought at those levels these particular companies, going forward, considering the kind of capex these companies have done, while globally, there has hardly been any improvement in terms of refineries expansion, GRMs are likely to improve going forward. However, there might be a decline in this quarter as we have seen in case of Reliance. I would probably look at buying BPCL at close to around Rs 255, rather than buying at the current level of around Rs 280 odd.Pharma names also doing well. You have a buy call on Dr Reddy’s. Why are you so bullish on Dr Reddy’s?In case of Dr Reddy’s, their quarterly numbers were pretty good in terms of margin expansion. Even if you look at the blockbuster drugs, Suboxone going forward is likely to add a significant amount of value to the company. The Russian market as well as the rest of the world did pretty well for them even as we saw margin improvement in the US market. The amount of negativity that one was hearing about the generic market in US seems to be subsiding a bit. Dr Reddy’s appears quite decent in risk-reward terms. Overall, 110-120 ANDA filings are due for the company. At least 10-15 of them coming from sites which are not under warning letters. Even under the warning letter, the number is close to 15-20. We see some of those issues reducing over the next six months to one year. Overall, within the pharmaceutical space, Dr Reddy’s seems to be a good stock to look at considering that the growth visibility looks superior to some of its peers.At IIFL, what is your outlook on auto ancillary space? Motherson Sumi is valued at close to around 15x FY20 which is close to around 35 to 40% discount to its average multiple for the last couple of years. Motherson Sumi looks a very good buy at current valuations. In terms of the growth rate, there have been challenges with some of the customer base in Europe talking about a profit warning. I see that the business model of Motherson is quite diversified in terms of the clientele as well as in terms of geography. The acquisitions that they have done are likely to show better capacity utilisations going forward.For that reason, it would not be a bad thing to buy a stock like Motherson Sumi at this particular juncture clearly because of the valuation at which it is trading at.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/use-this-opportunity-to-invest-in-sbi-reliance-abhimanyu-sofat-iifl/articleshow/66416335.cms
2018-10-29,"The telecom department will challenge the telecom tribunal TDSAT's order allowing Reliance Communications to sell spectrum to Reliance Jio without providing the bank guarantee. ""The licence conditions do not provide for accepting any barter system. DoT will challenge TDSAT order that directs it to allow RCom sell spectrum with land as security,"" a senior DoT official told . The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) in its order dated October 11, 2018, rejected plea of the Department of Telecom (DoT) seeking bank guarantee of around Rs 2,900 crore before it permits sale of RCom spectrum to Reliance Jio. RCom signed an agreement with Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to sell spectrum and other telecom assets for an estimated Rs 25,000 crore and clear its debt of about Rs 46,000 crore partially. However, the spectrum sale deal is stuck for clearance from the DoT for want of bank guarantee.

2018-10-30,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel’s decision to focus on reducing price points of smartphones and not bring in its own VoLTE feature phone to take on Reliance Industries’ JioPhone appears to be hurting it.Analysts said the Sunil Mittal-led telco has been unable to effectively counter JioPhone, which has resulted in Airtel losing millions of subscribers — especially those on its 2G network using feature phones — that experts attribute in part to the high uptake of Jio’s 4G feature phone, which runs on the Reliance Jio network. “Airtel is unable to deal with JioPhone’s pricing challenge as it does not have similar subsidised 4G VoLTE feature phones on offer, and it’s unlikely to engage in any aggressive customer acquisition strategy involving doling out of handset subsidies before having a comparable 4G network like Jio’s,” Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities, told ET.Analysts said it is easier-saidthan-done for Airtel — facing pressure on revenue and profitability — to subsidise handsets as they need to conserve cash to first augment 4G network capacity and catch up with Jio, which currently has a disproportionate share of data traffic flowing on 4G networks. No wonder, Bharti Airtel has steadfastly refused to toe the Jio line, despite being stung by the huge popularity of RIL’s recent Monsoon Hungama offer which allows exchanging any ordinary feature phone for a 4G JioPhone at just over Rs 1,000 (including six months recharge). The erstwhile telecom market leader lost as many as 6.6 million subscribers in the September quarter, while Reliance Jio, reported a 37 million customer additions during the period.Goldman Sachs attributed the phenomenon to “loss of (Airtel) subscribers to JioPhone” and “rationalisation of customers” gained, postacquisition of erstwhile Telenor India.“We estimate 15-20 million JioPhones were sold in the second quarter FY19, and if JioPhone traction remains strong, we could continue seeing pressure on Bharti’s revenues,” the brokerage said.But Airtel’s CEO Gopal Vittal was unfazed. “We have chosen not to compete in the VoLTE feature phone segment as we have feature phone users on our own network, and plan to get them to directly upgrade to smartphones,” Vittal said on an earnings call after the September quarter results.Last week, Airtel rolled out Rs 2,000 cashbacks for users upgrading to any 4G smartphone in clear bid to stop feature phone customer losses.Over the past one year, it has expanded its tie-ups with handset vendors to launch affordable 4G smartphones under its’Mera Pehla 4G smartphone’ drive to counter JioPhone’s threat.It is also trying to push more and more of its feature phone user base to 4G.Analysts though are sceptical of Airtel’s chances of migrating its feature phone user base to 4G smartphones amid the huge uptake of the subsidised JioPhone. Ordinary 2G device users, they said, have always been wary of shifting to smartphones due to the affordability factor but the advent of JioPhone has changed all that as it’s the cheapest device in the market for price-conscious 2G users to experience 4G data and video along with VoLTE-grade voice services.Rohan Dhamija, partner and head of India & Middle East at Analysys Mason, said that Jio’s decision to subsidise its 4G feature phone has “sharply reduced the upfront cost of 4G devices in a much more significant way than the cashbacks being offered by Airtel” to egg feature phone users to go 4G.Airtel’s Vittal admitted that the move from featurephones to lowcost smartphones is still some time away.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/airtel-facing-the-heat-from-reliance-industries-jiophone/articleshow/66424102.cms

Vodafone India and Idea — which merged in August — separately posted a drop of 2.6 million and 4 million, respectively, in user numbers.While these three together lost 9 million subscribers in September, Jio added 13.1million new users. “Jio’s Monsoon Hungama scheme and VoLTE featurephone were customer-acquisition strategies that are paying off,” said Sandip Das, analyst at consultancy firm Analysys Mason. Industry experts say Jio has now established a national footprint and begun to attract people with heavy data usage.“Earlier Jio would be the second SIM card” for most people, Das said, but, “they are now using Jio more than their primary cards.”Reliance Retail’s 4G featurephone, JioPhone, has also started to make major dents in the older players’ user base — especially at the low end — ever since it launched the Monsoon Hungama offer where one could exchange any featurephone for a JioPhone basic model for around Rs 1,000.Analysts said Airtel’s subscriber losses were also a result of the company letting go of some lowrevenue-generating subscribers who had come onboard after the company’s acquisition of Telenor India’s operations. However, Airtel continued to hold top positionwith 343.52 million subscribers in September, followed by Reliance Jio which had 252.3 million users.Vodafone and Idea, separately, had more than 221million and 213 million subscribers, respectively.

We now design end-to-end network solutions for fibre-to-the-home, fibre-to-the-enterprise, and fibre-to-the-small cells,” Anand Agarwal, group chief executive of Sterlite Tech told ETTelecom, adding that the new portfolio involves end equipment and software as well as a deployment solution.The Pune-based company, according to the top executive, is currently doing a Proof of Concept (PoC) for its newly-unveiled fibre-to-the-last mile or FTTx as a service platform with the India's third-largest telco.Agarwal said the company’s activity is centered around the access part of telecom networks which are increasingly becoming fibre-oriented with open-source hardware and software readily available for network management.The development on the back of Elitecore acquisition, however, would make Sterlite to partially compete with the likes of multinationals such as Cisco, Amdocs, Ciena and Juniper Networks as well as Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.With the telecom software company Elitecore Technologies’ merger in 2015, Sterlite is now well poised to market Operations Support Services (OSS) and Business Support Services (BSS) solutions to telecom companies.The telecom arm of the mining giant offers optic fibre infrastructure, Wi-Fi systems, in-building solutions, managed services and metro Ethernet network in addition to various software-driven services.The company, according to the top executive, design and deploy network solutions and besides Mumbai-based Jio, it is also running pilot programs with Sunil Mittal-driven Bharti Airtel as well as recently-merged entity Vodafone Idea.“For Jio’s 1,100 cities and 50 million homes, fibre is the key and for doing that, the execution plays a major role, and a part of our solutions work towards faster execution together with our hardware capability,” Agarwal said. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate is aggressively working on home broadband service Jio GigaFiber, which, according to the Mumbai-based company would come with a router as well as a set-top box for TV.However, Sterlite is already providing fibre to the billionaire Mukesh Ambani's ambitious Jio GigaFiber initiative.The company's debut of FTTx Mantra or massive agile network transformation solution is aimed to make service operators’ transition to fibre-powered backhaul, much needed to precipitate fourth-generation (4G) technology and upcoming 5G rollouts.The telecom arm of Reliance Industries is now looking to further expand fibre-based networks to as many as 1,500 cities to connect more than 30 million merchants and small-and-medium businesses in addition to large corporations.Ambani, however, also said that Jio was determined to move India to be among the top three markets in fixed-line broadband services.In wireline broadband penetration, India currently ranks at 134th position worldwide.The capabilities of two domestically-grown companies when combined, according to analysts, would be a win-win situation, and also would accelerate the country’s economic activity in line with government’s Make in India initiative. Jio did not respond to an emailed query.On the back of robust order book, the company has almost doubled the fibre production capacity to 50 million route kilometer (rkm).The company, according to the top executive, sees opportunity in government’s Wi-Fi push, and said that as more telecom networks continue to come to rural India combined with Wi-Fi systems, the company would holistically look into the new opportunity.In line with the government’s ambition, the telecom industry aims to deploy 1 million Wi-Fi hotspots before the end of 2019 in the country.For the fiscal ended March 31, 2018, Sterlite had reported a revenue of Rs 3,244 crore.India currently has less than a quarter of 4.75 lakh tower sites connected to optic fibre while another 100,000 tower sites, according to industry estimates, were needed to cater to the rising data demand.Sterlite’s 48% revenue comes from the global business while the company, according to Agarwal, is growing at around 29% Year-on-Year. It has recently won the Indian Navy’s Rs 3,500-crore worth deal to design, build, operate and maintain the latter’s digital network.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/sterlite-forays-into-telecom-access-network-solutions-teams-up-with-reliance-jio-for-fttx/articleshow/66505269.cms

2018-11-06,"India’s top apparel retail chains Shoppers Stop, Reliance Trends, Lifestyle, Future Group, Arvind Brands, Max and Fabindia said sales this festive season grew in double digits, quashing the impact of online discounts and overcoming a poor performance last time due to the introduction of GST.The retailers said same-store sales — a key performance indicator — grew by 8-15% during this festive season. Future Group and Fabindia said their sales were among the best in three years.In the offline category, the buoyant performance of fashion chains was also in stark contrast to sales of smartphones and televisions, which were hit badly this year by online discounting. Some offline retailers are offering discounts on certain bill sizes or gifts, which are pushing up sales, executives said.“Consumers are buying in stores since they can touch and feel products and have realised that online stores either sell very old stock or fakes and marketplaces do not like to take ownership of those,” said Future Retail joint MD Rakesh Biyani. He said samestore sales growth for apparel during this festive period has been in high double digits.Shoppers Stop CEO Rajiv Suri said sales during the six weeks to Durga Puja in the East were up by 19% over the same period last year, while it was in double digits for Diwali.“It has been one of the best festive seasons for us. Consumers tend to buy higherpriced merchandise as compared to the regular period and that trend continues,” he said. Suri said beauty products, women’s shoes and handbags, ethnic wear, personal accessories and fragrances drove growth.Dubai-based Landmark Group’s two fashion stores, Lifestyle and Max, said overall sales during the festive period were up 12% this year. Same-store sales for these two formats grew in high single digits, said Lifestyle International MD Vasanth Kumar.“Consumer sentiment towards brick-and-mortar stores is bullish. The average billing size is up by 2-3%. What has happened this year is that consumers are buying around 10 days before the festival as compared to 20 days earlier, but the overall consumption story is intact,” said Kumar.William Bissell, vice-chairman of Fabindia, said sales increased 12-14% this Diwali as compared to awashout in the previous two years. “On 45 days to Bhai Dhooj, we are up by 15%,” he said.“Diwali has been good in the west and south, though some pockets of the north are yet to pick up,” said Alok Dubey, Arvind Brands CEO for US Polo and Flying Machine.The festive season – from Durga Puja to Diwali – accounts for 30-40% of annual sales for consumer goods makers and retailers across products such as smartphones, electronics, apparel and fashion. Sales during the previous two years were impacted due to online discounting, the introduction of GST in 2017 and demonetisation in 2016.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fashion-/-cosmetics-/-jewellery/apparel-retailers-like-shoppers-stop-reliance-trends-record-double-digit-growth-this-festive-season/articleshow/66518945.cms

2018-11-06,"Top-rated Reliance Industries added some much-needed sparkle to an otherwise sluggish debt market on Diwali, raising about Rs 3,000 crore in bond sales Tuesday.Those papers offered 8.95% with 10-year maturity at a time when investors are mostly seen shying away from making new investments due to liquidity concerns.ICICI Bank has helped arrange the issue as it initially subscribed to papers on the electronic bidding platform. Later, top mutual funds and insurers were seen buying the long-dated Reliance papers from the bank.An email sent to Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank remained unanswered until the publication of this report.“The company has obtained fair pricing for the bonds. Yields could be about five-six basis points higher than its secondary levels,” said a domestic investment banker, who was not involved in the fund raising.Capacity additions and higher utilization could see Reliance’s consolidated operating profit rise 18% in FY19, the management hinted earlier in October.Reliance invested more than $30 billion over the past five years across its different verticals, such as refining, chemicals, retailing and telecom, to increase capacity, show reports.Earlier this year, Reliance had decided to raise up to Rs 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in this financial year. Last month, Reliance raised about Rs 3,500 through bonds, offering a rate exceeding 9%.These corporate bonds are priced after adding a mark-up over the benchmark yield, which has fallen 43 basis points lately. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.In the September quarter, Reliance’s net profit rose 17.4% to Rs 9,516 crore, aided by higher price realizations for petrochemicals and refinery products.Reliance Industries may soon buy controlling stakes in two of India’s largest cable TV and broadband service providers, Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks, as it seeks to expand the coverage of its ambitious high-speed broadband business, ET reported on October 16.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/reliance-industries-raises-rs-3000-crore-via-bond-sales/articleshow/66528678.cms
2018-11-07,"KOLKATA: Reliance Communications Ltd and its unit Reliance Telecom Ltd have only Rs 19.34 crore in their combined 144 bank accounts, the companies said in affidavits submitted to the Delhi High Court. The Anil Ambani-led company, which shut down its wireless operations last year under the weight of Rs 46,000 crore in debt, slumping revenue and widening losses, revealed its bank holdings in a case filed by American Tower Corp. The Boston-based tower company is said to be seeking dues of almost Rs 230 crore from RCom.RCom, which narrowly evaded being dragged into bankruptcy proceedings this year, informed the Delhi High Court that it has Rs 17.86 crore in 119 bank accounts, while its subsidiary RTL revealed it has a shade over Rs 1.48 crore across its 25 bank accounts. ET has reviewed the affidavits.Both companies, in affidavits filed in October, sought time from the court to produce their bank statements. The next hearing is on December 13. The tower company’s claims from RCom and RTL “add up to almost Rs 230 crore towards exit fees and service charges”, a person with knowledge of the matter told ET. The payments are for exiting tower lease agreements after RCom stopped wireless services in December.RCom’s Legal BattlesATC had moved the Delhi High Court against RCom and RTL in February, seeking a surety for its dues. However, RCom got a Supreme Court stay on November 1 on all payments due to ATC until the apex court hears the matter, people familiar with the development said. The date of the next hearing in the SC isn’t known. Separately, ATC filed contempt proceedings against RCom for non-compliance with a Delhi High Court order dated December 6, 2017, directing the telco to furnish a Rs 88-crore bank guarantee towards exit fees and other dues payable by Sistema Shyam Teleservices, which RCom acquired last year. This matter is under arbitration.At press time, ATC and RCom hadn’t responded to ET’s queries. RCom shares declined 1.8% to Rs 13.81at close on BSE on Tuesday. RCom is already involved in various legal battles. The Supreme Court gave it until December 15 to pay Swedish equipment maker Ericsson dues of Rs 550 crore plus interest. Ericsson has filed a contempt petition against RCom chairman Anil Ambani for non-payment of the dues on time, despite a personal guarantee, and the apex court will hear the plea after December 15.A dispute has also stalled RCom’s efforts to raise over Rs 18,000 crore by selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm and real estate holdings to Brookfield to help repay financial lenders and operational creditors including Ericsson. While it sold switching nodes and its optic fibre network to Jio for Rs 5,000 crore, its spectrum sale has been stuck because the Department of Telecommunications hasn’t approved the plan on account of a dispute over dues.The department of telecommunications is seeking Rs 2,947.68 crore in bank guarantees from RCom to cover spectrum usage charges. Although the telecom tribunal dismissed DoT’s pleas for the bank guarantees last month, the department is likely to challenge the order in the Supreme Court, further delaying the RCom-Jio spectrum deal. In its affidavits, RCom revealed that on April 9, 2018, it had a Rs 19.46 crore credit balance in one of its bank accounts, which was transferred to a trust and retention account maintained by State Bank of India.The money in this account, it said, was used to pay the DoT fees for extending the validity of various bank guarantees for spectrum and licence. Payments from this account are audited by RCom’s lenders before any money is released by SBI, it said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-reliance-telecom-have-just-rs-19-crore-in-accounts/articleshow/66531848.cms

2018-11-09,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries today said it has raised USD 800 million by selling 10-year bonds - the first offering since Moody's raised India's sovereign rating. The bonds were priced at 3.66 per cent, the lowest coupon ever achieved by an Indian corporate for a 10-year issuance, the company said in a statement. RIL, which is rated the same as the sovereign, will use the proceeds to refinance existing debt. This was the first dollar note this year. The note by RIL, India's largest company, was assigned 'BBB+' rating by S&P and 'Baa2' by Moody's Investors Service. ""The notes have been priced at 130 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury Note, at a price of 100 to yield at 3.667 per cent,"" the statement said. They will bear fixed interest of 3.66 per cent per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears and shall rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. This, RIL said, was the tightest ever spread over US Treasury for an Indian entity for a 10-year issuance. Also, it was the tightest ever spread over US Treasury for a 10-year BBB corporate issuance from Asia ex-Japan since the global financial crisis. ""The company will use the proceeds to redeem its existing USD 800 million 5.875 per cent senior perpetual fixed rate unsecured notes pursuant to the terms of such notes,"" it said. The notes were over 1.6 times oversubscribed across 90 accounts. V Srikanth, Joint Chief Financial Officer, RIL, said: ""This refinancing transaction was well received by high quality investors across asset managers, insurance companies and banks and helped us achieve substantial savings in interest cost over the life of the notes."" Issued against the backdrop of the upgrade of the country ratings by Moody's, RIL successfully concluded a swift intra- day execution to capitalise on the market window, he said. ""We are delighted to have issued 10-year bonds at the lowest coupon ever for an Indian corporate."" Once a net zero-debt company, RIL has borrowed heavily to fund its mega 4G telecom rollout. The company's debt swelled to Rs 2,14,145 crore at the end of September as compared to Rs 1,96,601 crore as on March 31, 2017. Cash in hand was marginally lower at Rs 77,014 crore. Assigning its 'BBB+' rating for the bonds issue, S&P Global Ratings had yesterday stated that RIL continues to bolster its business profile with new growth projects in its already large, integrated and efficient oil refining and petrochemical businesses. ""The completion of recent investments in the refining and petrochemical segment will further add to the company's cash flows,"" it said, adding that RIL's diverse businesses with high levels of integration help offset the cyclicality inherent in the oil and gas and petrochemicals industries. S&P said RIL is on track to achieve Ebitda of about Rs 70,000 crore in the current fiscal and Rs 90,000 crore in 2018-19. Ebitda was Rs 32,500 crore for the first half of the current fiscal. Moody's Investors Service had separately stated that RIL's Baa2 rating reflects the company's strong ability to generate operating cash flows, with annual Ebidta exceeding USD 10 billion from its large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical operations which generate strong margins and the company's nascent but growing digital services business.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-raises-usd-800-million-via-10-yr-bonds-at-lowest-rate/articleshow/66555055.cms

2018-11-12,"Interest rates are likely to remain range-bound, making both ultra-short and short-term schemes, and credit risk funds with 1-3 year duration quite attractive, Amit Tripathi, CIO, Fixed Income Investments, Reliance Mutual Fund tells ET Wealth.Is the fragility in the bond market likely to stay for a while?We have already seen the bulk of the yield movement in the past 18 months, and it is likely to be range-bound (7.5-8%), till the macro picture—external and domestic— becomes clear. There has been an uptick in spreads in the recent past, driven primarily by liquidity conditions. While high grade spreads look attractive, the financial sector spreads will remain elevated for some time, owing to asset liability management (ALM)-driven issuance pressures.Are NBFCs equipped to overcome the current hardships?NBFCs have been there for long and are well-equipped to handle liquidity and credit cycles. The sector is also quite diverse, from pure retail to pure wholesale lenders, each with a different asset and liability side construct. The environment calls for consolidation in terms of growth, ALM, asset quality and leverage, and most of the NBFCs are fully aware and capable of adapting. In fact, once the dust settles, we may see some NBFCs taking advantage of market dislocations to capture higher market share.How big are concerns over the fall in rupee and rise in oil prices for the bond market?Oil and rupee are both a current account and an inflation play, so any marked movement needs the market to adjust. The market has broadly adjusted to the recent move in oil and rupee, and has factored in the medium-term impact on inflation as well. However, any sharp move from here on may result in another round of adjustments. The good news is on the inflation front, which, in spite of challenges of the post-GST environment, adverse oil and currency movement, has still remained below expectations, led by very soft food inflation, and controlled core inflation.How would you assess the credit health of Indian companies?The private sector has broadly deleveraged over the past five years, the balance sheets look better, and the operating leverage is helping. The financial services space is generally well capitalised, barring some names, but the asset-side issues will have to be monitored in the near-to-medium term. But we strongly believe in a bottom up approach to credit. A generalist sectoral approach doesn’t work well when there are noticeable distinctions in terms of management quality, information asymmetry, and a dynamic business environment.At a time when the reliability of credit ratings is under question, can bond funds do better credit appraisal?Credit appraisal is a detailed, intensive process; very bottom up in nature, calling for the right blend of quantitative and qualitative inputs. The very fact that fund managers have a choice to exercise (the ability to say no to rating agencies), means they can do a better job, as long as their analysis is thorough, forward looking through the cycle. Our own track record specifically, and the fund industry’s track record in general, has been a testimony to this. As portfolio managers, we have a fiduciary responsibility in terms of our investor mandates. We have to be convinced fully in terms of the issuer, security, structure and credit performance before we commit to any investment. It is backed by a rigorous and quality process and people infrastructure.How long is the interest rate upcycle likely to last this time?The RBI is clearly focused on inflation as the key driver for their policy—interest rate and liquidity—decisions. Given the current and expected trajectory of inflation—our estimates for 2018-19 and 2019-20 are comfortably in the RBI 4% (+- 2%) range—going forward we don’t envisage more than one or two rate hikes. Given that markets have already priced in a bulk of this move, we don’t see rates rising beyond the recent highs over the next 6-12 months. The risk to our view can come from loose local or global fiscal policies, which can have a negative impact on the inflation trajectory.What type of bond funds make most sense for investors now?Given the fact that a large part of the interest rate move has happened, bond funds across categories look attractive from a oneto three-year time frame. However, we are still some way away from any secular downward move in rates, given the evolving local and global macro trends.In this environment of range-bound rates and attractive carry, investors could choose from high grade (ultras short-term and short-term funds) or high yield (credit risk) funds which operate with a 1-3 year neutral duration strategy. In the near future, carry will be the predominant driver of returns in the fixed income category. Duration funds can be a tactical play for now, till such time there is clarity on the macro environment.Have the revised scheme categorisation norms for bond funds impacted fund managers?

2018-11-12,"Interest rates are likely to remain range-bound, making both ultra-short and short-term schemes, and credit risk funds with 1-3 year duration quite attractive, Amit Tripathi, CIO, Fixed Income Investments, Reliance Mutual Fund tells ET Wealth.Is the fragility in the bond market likely to stay for a while?We have already seen the bulk of the yield movement in the past 18 months, and it is likely to be range-bound (7.5-8%), till the macro picture—external and domestic— becomes clear. There has been an uptick in spreads in the recent past, driven primarily by liquidity conditions. While high grade spreads look attractive, the financial sector spreads will remain elevated for some time, owing to asset liability management (ALM)-driven issuance pressures.Are NBFCs equipped to overcome the current hardships?NBFCs have been there for long and are well-equipped to handle liquidity and credit cycles. The sector is also quite diverse, from pure retail to pure wholesale lenders, each with a different asset and liability side construct. The environment calls for consolidation in terms of growth, ALM, asset quality and leverage, and most of the NBFCs are fully aware and capable of adapting. In fact, once the dust settles, we may see some NBFCs taking advantage of market dislocations to capture higher market share.How big are concerns over the fall in rupee and rise in oil prices for the bond market?Oil and rupee are both a current account and an inflation play, so any marked movement needs the market to adjust. The market has broadly adjusted to the recent move in oil and rupee, and has factored in the medium-term impact on inflation as well. However, any sharp move from here on may result in another round of adjustments. The good news is on the inflation front, which, in spite of challenges of the post-GST environment, adverse oil and currency movement, has still remained below expectations, led by very soft food inflation, and controlled core inflation.How would you assess the credit health of Indian companies?The private sector has broadly deleveraged over the past five years, the balance sheets look better, and the operating leverage is helping. The financial services space is generally well capitalised, barring some names, but the asset-side issues will have to be monitored in the near-to-medium term. But we strongly believe in a bottom up approach to credit. A generalist sectoral approach doesn’t work well when there are noticeable distinctions in terms of management quality, information asymmetry, and a dynamic business environment.At a time when the reliability of credit ratings is under question, can bond funds do better credit appraisal?Credit appraisal is a detailed, intensive process; very bottom up in nature, calling for the right blend of quantitative and qualitative inputs. The very fact that fund managers have a choice to exercise (the ability to say no to rating agencies), means they can do a better job, as long as their analysis is thorough, forward looking through the cycle. Our own track record specifically, and the fund industry’s track record in general, has been a testimony to this. As portfolio managers, we have a fiduciary responsibility in terms of our investor mandates. We have to be convinced fully in terms of the issuer, security, structure and credit performance before we commit to any investment. It is backed by a rigorous and quality process and people infrastructure.How long is the interest rate upcycle likely to last this time?The RBI is clearly focused on inflation as the key driver for their policy—interest rate and liquidity—decisions. Given the current and expected trajectory of inflation—our estimates for 2018-19 and 2019-20 are comfortably in the RBI 4% (+- 2%) range—going forward we don’t envisage more than one or two rate hikes. Given that markets have already priced in a bulk of this move, we don’t see rates rising beyond the recent highs over the next 6-12 months. The risk to our view can come from loose local or global fiscal policies, which can have a negative impact on the inflation trajectory.What type of bond funds make most sense for investors now?Given the fact that a large part of the interest rate move has happened, bond funds across categories look attractive from a oneto three-year time frame. However, we are still some way away from any secular downward move in rates, given the evolving local and global macro trends.In this environment of range-bound rates and attractive carry, investors could choose from high grade (ultras short-term and short-term funds) or high yield (credit risk) funds which operate with a 1-3 year neutral duration strategy. In the near future, carry will be the predominant driver of returns in the fixed income category. Duration funds can be a tactical play for now, till such time there is clarity on the macro environment.Have the revised scheme categorisation norms for bond funds impacted fund managers? Are investors better off under the new structure?The scheme recategorisation has provided much-needed clarity in terms of interest rate and credit risk that various categories of funds carry. It also makes life easier for investors to compare funds in the same category and take informed decisions based on their risk-return profile. From our perspective, given that we have always adhered to fund positioning in letter and spirit, the formal fund categorisation reinforces our stand of being true-to-label.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/short-term-and-short-term-credit-risk-mfs-look-attractive-amit-tripathi-reliance-mutual-fund/articleshow/66585734.cms

2018-11-13,"Mumbai: Reliance Infrastructure has bagged a Rs 16.14 crore arbitration award against National Highway Authority of India, a small win for the company which has Rs 8,000 crore of claims with different government agencies.With this win, Reliance Infrastructure has won a total of six arbitration awards amounting to around Rs 6,300 crore in cases of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Goa Power Plant and NHAI Roads. The company now has over Rs 8,000 crore of claims under advanced stages of arbitration for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects, Mumbai Metro and road jobs, a company statement said.Reliance Infrastructure said Tuesday that a three-member arbitration tribunal ordered NHAI to pay Rs 16.14 crore by February 10, 2019 to the company. NHAI will have to pay interest of 12% per annum on the amount if it does not pay by the deadline. This order is in addition to a Rs 200 crore arbitration award the company bagged earlier in August for the same NHAI project for cost over-run and loss of revenue.“The need for current arbitration arose due to cost over-run in consultant fees during construction, delayed payment of grant and additional expenses due to change in law on TD Toll Road Private, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure, which NHAI did not reimburse as per the terms of the concession agreement,” the company said in the statement.TD Toll Road has designed, built and is operating an 87-km-long 4-lane national highway, NH45, connecting Trichy and Dindigul in Tamil Nadu. The project construction work was completed and commercial operation started in January 2012.Many construction firms have funded large cost and time overruns on their own balance sheets in the absence of timely compensation from client. With a multi-year dispute resolution process, these companies are dependent on relief from the courts after PSUs and other government authorities challenge binding arbitration awards all the way to the Supreme Court. Industry says that these clients mechanically appeal all the way up to the apex court, thereby making a mockery of the dispute resolution process.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/reliance-infrastructure-bags-rs-16-14-crore-arbitration-award-against-nhai/articleshow/66607239.cms

2018-11-19,"MUMBAI: Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (RNAM) has filed draft papers with the regulators for the fourth tranche of the CPSE Exchange Traded Fund. The ETF, likely to be launched in the last week of November, will raise Rs 8,000 crore with a green shoe option to retain Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 crore.The asset management company first raised Rs 3,000 crore through the NFO in March 2014, followed by Rs 6,000 crore in January 2017, and Rs 2,500 crore in March 2017.This time around, the CPSE index has been rebalanced and includes power sector stocks. The number of stocks in the CPSE index has increased by one to 11 stocks, with the entry of four new companies – NTPC, NLC, SJVN and NBCC - from the power and construction sectors.Three companies - GAIL, Container Corporation and Engineers India - exited the index as the divestment target of the government in these three companies was achieved.“When we look at the composition of the CPSE, 6 out of 11 companies in CPSE ETF are sector leaders in their respective fields and these are the sectors where even the government is focusing a lot - whether it’s more of localising the production or even scaling up of production,” says a report by SMC Institutional Equities. “Hence, we believe the respective companies have enough opportunity in the long run to grow and reward their shareholders.”To be sure, the CPSE ETF has given an annualised return of 7.13 per cent over the last three years, lower than the Nifty return of 11.19 per cent. Over the last one year, it lost 13.39 per cent as compared to the Nifty gaining 5.56 per cent.“The CPSE existing tranche has not managed to beat the broader market represented by the Nifty over one year or three years. The product construct excludes allocation to privately managed companies. These companies have generated major shareholder wealth in the past and are likely to continue to do so, which the ETF will likely miss,” says Amol Joshi, Founder, Plan Rupee.He believes an investor with a specific view on these sets of companies can subscribe to this ETF, and it might not be suitable for lay investors looking to create wealth.

2018-11-19,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Shree Cements (SRCM) with a target price of Rs 17,200.The current market price of Shree Cements is Rs 15,831.80.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Shree Cements price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerage:Healthy sales volume growth drives revenue: SRCM’s sales volume grew by a healthy 15.6 per cent YoY (-19 per cent QoQ) to 5.64mnT (including clinker of 0.21mnT) owing to healthy demand environment in its key markets. Consequently, its revenue grew by 21 per cent YoY (-16 per cent QoQ) to Rs25.9bn aided by 75 per cent YoY growth in power division’s revenue. Power volume stood at 400mn units with average tariff of Rs 4.49/unit (+29 per cent YoY and +1 per cent QoQ).Superior realisation leads to healthy operating performance: While cost pressure continued to prevail led by sustained rise in fuel prices, SRCM reported a better-than-expected operating performance due to higher-than-expected improvement (3.9 per cent QoQ) in average NSR to Rs4,268/tonne. Adjusted EBITDA stood at Rs5.73bn vs. our estimate of Rs 4.83bn, while EBITDA/tonne came at ~Rs946 vs. Rs1,133 and Rs863 in 2QFY18 and 1QFY19, respectively. Higher trade volume from Northern region (~76 per cent vs. nearly 60 per cent) led to higher realisations.Outlook & Valuation: We believe SRCM has been moving in the right direction in its pursuit to dominate the markets by adding capacity at regular intervals, which we believe will help the Company to grow market share with strong profitability without much stress on balance sheet. Hence, its premium multiple is expected to sustain, which can be supported by thin liquidity and meagre non-institutional holdings. Recent commissioning of new capacities and near-completion of Karnataka clinker units are likely to aid SRCM to gain further traction, going forward. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with a downwardly revised Target Price of Rs 17,200 (16x FY20 EBITDA).",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-shree-cements-target-rs-17200-reliance-securities/articleshow/66688845.cms
2018-11-19,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on NCC with a target price of Rs 157.The current market price of NCC is Rs 88.70.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when NCC price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerage:NCC (NJCC) reported a stellar performance in 2QFY19 as well with its revenue and adjusted PAT growing by 138 per cent YoY and 167 per cent YoY, respectively mainly underpinned by better execution and higher-than-expected operating margin. Its reported revenue stood at Rs31bn (+32 per cent QoQ). While EBITDA grew by 194 per cent YoY to Rs3.65bn, EBITDA margin rose by 220bps YoY and 41bps QoQ to 11.8 per cent.Upgrading our EBITDA estimate by 11 per cent/4 per cent for FY19E/FY20E mainly to factor in strong margins, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a marginally revised Target Price of Rs157 (from Rs153 earlier).Strong execution & robust order book drive performance: Led by a decent ramp-up in execution with strong order backlog, NJCC has delivered a robust performance with its revenue and EBITDA growing by 138 per cent YoY and 167 per cent YoY, respectively, while its EBITDA margin rose by 220bps YoY to 11.8 per cent. Looking ahead, we expect revenue to clock 29 per cent CAGR through FY18-FY20E. NJCC booked Rs1bn and Rs2bn unbilled revenue in revenue portion as per Ind-AS. The Management has maintained the earlier revenue growth guidance of nearly 45 per cent YoY for FY19E (Rs110bn) on the back of robust order inflow and a higher proportion of fast-track projects.Order book continues to remain robust: Having witnessed a robust order inflow of (nearly Rs233bn in FY18 and Rs83.6bn in 1HFY19, NJCC’s order book currently stands at Rs330bn (4.4x of FY18 revenue), which provides a healthy revenue visibility. Further, NJCC has secured orders worth Rs20bn in Oct’18, and the Management expects to secure orders worth Rs140bn in FY19E. Considering Rs104bn inflows are already achieved till date, we believe achieving the targeted order inflow should not be an issue. As order book position has improved substantially, the Company may try to consolidate its position for some time to focus more on execution.Outlook & valuation: Deterioration in the working capital cycle – mainly led by higher working capital requirement due to mobilisation advances to sub-contractors for new projects – was a prime concern for NJCC. We expect its working capital requirement to remain high considering robust order book. Nonetheless, expecting NJCC’s revenue and earnings to clock 29 per cent and 24 per cent CAGR, respectively through FY18-FY20E, we reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised SOTP-based Target Price of Rs157.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-ncc-target-rs-157-reliance-securities/articleshow/66688908.cms
2018-11-19,"By Saket Sundria and Debjit ChakrabortyBillionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd. is considering a plan to boost its oil-refining capacity by about half, people with knowledge of the matter said.The proposed plant, to come up at the world’s biggest refining complex in Jamnagar, will be able to process as much as 30 million tons of crude a year, the people said asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. A Reliance spokesman didn’t reply to an email seeking comment.Asia’s richest man seeks to cement Reliance’s dominance in the world’s fastest-growing major oil consuming nation as rivals including Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., and Russia’s Rosneft PJSC acquire plants in India. Total SA and Royal Dutch Shell are also expanding into fuel retailing in India. International Energy Agency expects India’s energy demand to more than double by 2040, making it the single largest source of global growth.Reliance has begun discussions with global refinery process licencors and equipment vendors for the new refining train at the Jamnagar complex, the people said. The plant of the size planned by the company may cost $10 billion, they said.Saudi Aramco and ADNOC signed agreements to invest in a proposed 60-million ton refinery complex on India’s west coast while Rosneft and partners acquired the country’s second-largest private oil processor.Shell has restarted retailing gasoline and diesel in the country, while Total partnered the Adani Group to set up liquefied natural gas import terminals and fuel retailing business. Last year, BP Plc expanded its partnership with Reliance to retail auto fuels.Demand for fuel in India and the Middle East will make the two regions bigger oil consumers than the European Union by 2030, driven mainly by diesel for trucks and petrochemicals feedstock, according to the IEA.Reliance is looking to process the dirtiest and heaviest crude and may focus on producing feedstock for petrochemicals, the people said.The expansion plan is still under discussion and hasn’t been finalized, the people said. A feasibility report is likely to be prepared by the end of next year, once the recently-expanded petrochemicals capacities stabilize, and Reliance is expected to make the final investment decision with an aim to start work in 2020, the people said.The company had considered expanding its refining capacity in the past, and in 2013-14 it sought environment approval for the project. Reliance didn’t move ahead with the plan as it focused on increasing downstream chemicals capacities and building the telecom business.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/reliance-said-to-plan-expanding-worlds-largest-refinery-complex/articleshow/66688972.cms

2018-11-21,"Reliance Industries (RIL) violated contractual terms and state policy on coal-bed methane (CBM) by selling its entire output to itself, an official probe has found. This can lead to the termination of the gas-sales deal worth a few hundred million dollars.Reliance began commercial production of CBM at its Madhya Pradesh mines last year. It conducted three auctions in quick succession — the first two for shorter duration and the third one in September 2017 for the sale of the entire gas to be produced up to March 2021. It was the highest bidder in all three, which the company said in the past would maximise government revenue.The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the upstream regulator, found faults with these auctions last year, and pointed out that Reliance, by participating in the auction alongside other bidders, hadn’t complied with the CBM policy that imposes conditions on sales to an affiliate to avoid conflict of interest.This triggered a wider probe by the oil ministry, where officials debated over the policy provisions for months, sought law ministry’s opinion and RIL’s point of view on the matter, sources said. It took a year for the probe to conclude that RIL’s sale of CBM to itself was a violation of policy as well as that of production sharing contract terms, which require operators to conduct sale on arm’s length basis, they said.The oil ministry and Reliance Industries didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries for the story. Reliance had earlier said that the company won in an open, transparent auction conducted by CRISIL, an independent agency.It said the auction had helped maximise the benefits to the government, fulfilling the key objective of the CBM policy. The contract and CBM policy mandate sale on arm’s length basis and by participating in the auction for its own produce RIL attracted allegation of conflict of interest. The CBM policy allows the sale to an affiliate if the producer can't find a buyer in a competitive process. But Reliance didn't wait to find a buyer and instead participated alongside other potential buyers in the auction, violating the policy, sources aware of the official probe findings said.As a consequence of the probe findings, Reliance may now have to terminate its CBM sales contracts with itself and reauction future produce, sources said, adding that the gas already produced, sold and used under these contracts will likely remain unaffected by the government decision.In all three auctions, Reliance won the bid by quoting a price higher than other participants, thereby causing no apparent loss to the government in terms of royalty or taxes. In the current contract, it quoted $1.29 per unit higher price than nearest competitor Piramal Glass. The official probe has pointed out that Reliance should have first undertaken the step described in para 1.1 of the CBM Policy, and only after failing to identify a buyer in the process, the company should have gone for a deal with itself or an affiliate.“Sale of CBM to any Affiliate of the Contractor is permitted, in the event the Contractor cannot identify any buyer following the procedure as stipulated in para 1.1,” the para 1.5 of the CBM Policy says. The para 1.1 referred to here says “It has been decided to provide marketing and pricing freedom to the contractors of CBM blocks to sell the CBM at Arm’s Length Price in the domestic market. While discovering the market price for Arm’s Length Sales, the Contractor has to ensure a fully transparent and competitive process for sale of CBM with the objective that the best possible price is realised, to the benefit of all parties to the contract, without any restrictive commercial practices…”",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/probe-finds-ril-flouted-cbm-auction-policy/articleshow/66726478.cms

2018-11-21,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm will serve the country's largest and most sought-after accounts in telecom - the railways - from January 1, with officials saying it is likely to slash the national transporter's phone bills by around 35 per cent at least. Railways has been using Bharati Airtel for over six years as its telecom provider for 1.95 lakh mobile phone connections used by its employees in closed user group (CUG) across the country for which the railways paid around Rs 100 crore bill per year, they said. Its validity will expire on December 31 this year. A Railway Board order issued on November 20 said it ""had assigned the responsibility to RailTel (railway PSU) for finalisation of fresh CUG scheme for Indian Railways as the validity of the existing scheme is expiring on December 31, 2018. Fresh CUG scheme had since been finalised by RailTel and Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited has been awarded the contract to implement the scheme."" ""The fresh CUG will come into effect from January 1, 2019,"" said the order which detailed the tariff rates to be provided by the company. Closed User group (CUG) is a supplementary service provided by the mobile operators to subscribers who can make and receive calls from any member associated within the group. This service is applicable for SMS also. Under the scheme, Reliance Jio, the latest entrant in the telecom market, will provide 4G/3G connections and calls will be free of charge. The company will provide four packages to railways - one for its senior most officials (two percent subscribers) - a 60 GB plan with a monthly rental of Rs 125, a 45 GB plan at a monthly rental of Rs 99 for its joint secretary level officers (26 per cent subscribers), a 30 GB plan at a rental of Rs 67 for Group C staff (72 per cent subscribers) and a Rs 49 rental plan for bulk SMS. For regular subscribers, a 25 GB plan of Jio is available for Rs 199 and subscribers have to pay Rs 20 per GB thereafter to top up their plans. Railway employees have to pay Rs 10 for 2 GB of extra data they use and more thereafter, according to the plan worked out by Jio. While under the present scheme railways is charged for calls outside CUG, the plan from January 1 will not do so. Also, the 3G/4G data pack in effect from next year is much cheaper than the present packs available to railways.""While Airtel is serving around 1.95 lakh railway subscribers, Jio will serve 3.78 lakh personnel of the railways, and because of the increase in the numbers, we are getting a better deal from the service provider. As a result of this, we are likely to reduce our phone bill by around 35 per cent,"" a senior official said. Last month, Reliance Jio Infocomm had emerged as the lowest bidder for the account beating Airtel and Vodafone. Sources say that while railways had demanded free calls from the bidders and got it from all of them, it was the low cost data that pushed Jio as the frontrunner.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-to-take-over-as-service-provider-for-railways-from-jan-1/articleshow/66737294.cms

2018-11-26,"Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have stemmed Reliance Jio’s onslaught in the metros and big states in terms of revenue market share in the September quarter, with analysts saying the older carriers’ efforts to boost 4G coverage in urban markets is finally paying off.Mukesh Ambani-led Jio though offset its lackluster show in the metros with strong growth momentum in second-tier states and rural markets, which meant its overall RMS increased significantly, while Vodafone Idea’s decreased and Airtel’s remained flattish.Bharti Airtel has reported strong RMS gains in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, Maharashtra and Gujarat, while market leader Vodafone Idea bolstered its position in Delhi and Kolkata, ICICI Securities said, analysing telco financial data put out by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).By contrast, Jio, the brokerage said, suffered heavy sequential RMS losses in Delhi (113 basis points) and Kolkata (752 basis points) in the fiscal second quarter.Brokerage UBS backed the view, saying Airtel’s overall RMS from metros has grown sequentially to 30% (from 27% in the June quarter), while VIL has held ground with 32% metro RMS. Jio’s metro RMS has dipped to 24.9% in the September quarter from 26.3% in the April-June period.Bharti Airtel shares gained 1.84% to close at Rs 334 on BSE on Monday though VIL’s fell nearly 3% to Rs 39.95.The older carriers’ stronger RMS show in metros is also reflected in Airtel and VIL reporting 17.6% and 5% on-quarter growth in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) coming from metro circles respectively, analysts said. AGR is the revenue a telco derives from licensed services.Over the past two years, Airtel and VIL have been steadily losing ground to Jio amid the latter’s continuing pricing aggression. But brokerage UBS believes “the fightback has started,” and the sequential RMS recovery shown by Bharti and VIL in the metros shows their 4G network expansion is showing results,” adding that it remains to be seen if this fightback plays out across a wider geography as both older carriers refarm low band spectrum in the 900 MHz band for 4G services.Airtel and Vodafone have announced plans to refarm their 900 Mhz spectrum for LTE services to rapidly convert their 2G user base to 4G, a strategy that is likely to help them garner more 4G customers, especially in markets where they don’t have comparable coverage like Jio’s.Brokerage SBICap Securities though said “Jio remains the RMS market leader in B & C circles (read: tier-2 states and rural markets), which generate 48% of the national AGR”.Revenue growth in the second-tier states and rural markets has helped Jio expand its national RMS by as much as 375 bps on-quarter to over 26 % at the end of September. By contrast, Bharti Airtel’s overall RMS has been flattish at 30.9% while VIL’s plunged 190 bps sequentially to 32.8%, amid AGR declines nearly across India.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/airtel-voda-idea-stave-off-reliance-jio-push-in-metros-analysts/articleshow/66812317.cms
2018-11-26,"Reliance Communications (RCom) has told the Supreme Court on Monday that its spectrum trading deal with Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) will be in jeopardy if the telecom department does not accept a land parcel as security instead of bank guarantees for repayment of earlier dues, and clears the spectrum trading pact. However, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said it will only accept bank guarantees for dues of about Rs 3000 crore and suggested that Jio could also make the payment on RCom’s behalf, legal sources present in court said. “RCom told the apex court that if DoT does not give an NOC (no-objection certificate) to the spectrum trading deal with Jio, then the deal will fall through. The operator argued that DoT should accept the land parcel as guarantee as per an earlier order, but DoT refused,” said a person aware of the development. Rcom did not respond to ET's emailed queries seeking comment.For Rcom, the spectrum deal is a crucial part of its overall asset sale to Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio, which will help the operator to reduce its debt of Rs 46,000. If the deal falls through, then RCom will not be able to pay its dues to companies like Ericsson within the stipulated time then it heads into insolvency. The SC has set December 15 as the next deadline for RCom's payment to Ericsson. According to another source, DoT’s legal representatives even told the apex court that since it will only accept bank guarantees and RCom says it cannot offer that , then maybe Jio could do so on the telco’s behalf. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal assisted by advocate Mahesh Agarwal , appeared on behalf of RCom, while additional solicitor general P.S. Narasimha represented DoT. The matter will be heard on Tuesday as well. The battle between the telecom department and the Anil Ambani owned telco is over spectrum related dues worth Rs 2,947.68 crore and has been on since DoT’s reluctance to give the Jio deal a go ahead till the government recovers its dues. In an interim order in October, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) directed DoT to “expeditiously” allow the carrier to sell spectrum Jio without bank guarantees from Anil Ambani’s debt-laden telco. The tribunal also directed RCom not to sell a land parcel worth Rs 1,400 crore “for the time being.” The land was slotted to be the guarantee against the government’s demand for dues.The DoT then moved a plea for modification of the order, saying it can’t accept land as a guarantee, and instead pressed for bank guarantees. The TDSAT had rejected this plea for modification, and DoT moved the apex court in another bid to recover its dues. RCom has been racing against time to sell its spectrum to Jio, but the deal has been delayed mainly due to DoT’s demand for dues before clearing the trading pact. As a result, RCom, which said it will repay Ericsson, and HSBC Daisy Investments and minority shareholders from the Rs 975 crore that it will get from the Jio deal, has not been able to meet its payment commitments. RCom has been given time till December 15 to repay Ericsson its dues. Recently ET had reported that RCom which narrowly evaded being dragged into bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, informed Delhi High Court it has around Rs 17.86 crore across its 119-odd bank accounts, while its subsidiary, RTL, has just a shade over Rs 1.48 crore across its 25-odd bank accounts. This was during another legal tussle with American Tower Corp (ATC), for not clearing its dues. RCom, under a debt of Rs 46,000 crore, is desperately trying to sell its assets to Jio and Brookfield for about Rs 18,000 crore. While fibre and switching nodes have gone to Jio for Rs 5,000 crore, spectrum and towers are yet to be sold to the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco and some real estate sale to Canadian asset management firm Brookfield is also pending.Shares of RCom closed at Rs 13.32, up by 0.30% on the BSE on Monday.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-says-jio-deal-in-jeopardy-unless-dot-clears/articleshow/66815845.cms

2018-11-27,"Gas output at Reliance Industries’ coal bed methane (CBM) block has fallen way short of the planned ramp-up due to a combination of operational issues and poor pipeline connectivity. Production at RIL’s CBM block in Madhya Pradesh contracted to 0.94 million metric standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) in July-September from 1mmscmd in the April-June period.The poor show by RIL’s CBM block, its depleting KG-D6 block, along with Focus Energy’s underperforming block in Rajasthan, resulted in a 13% decline in natural gas output from fields controlled by private players between April and October, according to the oil ministry’s monthly report on production data.State-run Oil India’s gas production also declined 7% this year from last year but ONGC, country’s largest oil and gas producer, increased gas output by 3%. India’s natural gas output fell 1% in April-October from last year.The oil ministry’s monthly report on production data cites “under-performance of CBM wells and the constraint imposed by Iffco on CBM offtake from September 22” as the key reasons for lower output at Sohagpur West CBM Block of Reliance Industries.Reliance didn’t elaborate on the reasons for output decline, but sources with knowledge of the matter said heavy rains affected second quarter production and the decline has now been arrested.Production is also hurt due to limited pipeline access. Reliance has agreements with itself to use its CBM output at its facilities in Gujarat and Maharashtra, but doesn’t yet have access to a pipeline that can pump gas from its fields to its plants. So, it has reached an understanding with GAIL, which takes CBM to fertiliser-maker Iffco, the single customer connected to the pipeline, and in turn delivers imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) to RIL’s facilities in western India, sources said.Iffco is GAIL’s customer and variation in the fertiliser maker’s gas requirement impacts the amount of gas RIL’s CBM fields can produce or its facilities can receive from GAIL.Once more customers join the pipeline, Reliance plans to undertake drilling of new wells and build additional infrastructure to boost its coal bed methane output, sources said.Another help would come when a pipeline gets ready to pump gas from Reliance Industries’s fields to the western states. At present, gas only travels from the western coast to interiors.CBM wells also yield a lot of water and Reliance has undertaken dewatering process to achieve the ramp-up, which typically takes 18-36 months, sources said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/operational-and-connectivity-issues-pull-down-ril-cbm-block-output/articleshow/66834469.cms

The whole game plane of Reliance Jio is to wipe out its competitors, which includes the state owned BSNL,"" BSNL unions said in a joint statement.All Unions and Associations of BSNL (AUAB) alleged that with its huge financial muscle, Reliance Jio is offering services at 'below-cost' rates. It said that private telecom companies like Aircel, Tata Teleservices, Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications and Telenor have already closed their mobile service businesses.It alleged that Reliance Jio will steeply raise call and data tariffs once the entire competition is wiped out.""It will loot the people by steeply raising the call and data charges.

As a result, JS Deepak was instantaneously shunted out of the DoT... This was a clear signal given by the Narendra Modi government, as to what would happen to any one who dares to speak against Rliance Jio,"" the unions alleged.Deepak was named India's Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) when he was abroad to attend the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Spain.The unions said that BSNL was in a loss of more than Rs 8,800 crore in 2011-12 but due to the combined efforts taken by the employees and the management, the PSU posted an operating profit of Rs 672.57 crore in 2014-15.""BSNL's improved performance is reflected in the expansion of it's customer base also.

2018-11-30,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Larsen & Toubro (L&T) with a target price of Rs 1,760.The current market price of Larsen & Toubro is Rs 1,417.50.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Larsen & Toubro price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerageHealthy order book: Current order book stands at Rs 2,815 bn (2.3x of FY18 revenue). Order prospects remain healthy in FY19 at Rs 4 trillion led by infrastructure orders of nearly Rs 2000 bn, Power T&D nearly Rs950bn, MMH nearly Rs 15 bn, hydrocarbon nearly Rs 800 bn, and Heavy Engineering & Defense Rs 100 bn. GoI is planning to spend Rs 7 trillion in next 5 years to develop 83,677km of roads including Bharatmala (Rs 5.4 trln). L&T has reported strong 42 per cent growth in order inflow during H1 FY19 at Rs 780 bn; while the management has maintained its FY19 order inflow guidance at 10 per cent-12 per cent implying inflow to decline by nearly 10 per cent in H2 FY19 due to general elections. We expect order inflow to grow at a CAGR of 12 per cent during FY18-21. With India expected to invest significantly in infrastructure creation over the next few years, the company like L&T is in a sweet spot.Earning momentum to sustain: We expect execution rate to stabilise led by incremental order inflows. We expect L&T’s EBITDA margin to expand to 11.8 per cent in 21E from 11.3 per cent in FY18, as various early-stage projects in which progress is below the required level to recognize EBITDA margin would reach their respective thresholds. We expect ROE to improve to 16.2 per cent in FY21 from 13.2 per cent in FY18 led by execution pick up and margin expansion. Strong cash flow led by stable working capital, lower equity commitment for developmental assets and monetisation of non-core assets augur well for L&T.Divestment of Non-core Assets: In May’18, L&T announced the sale of its E&A business to Schneider Electric for an all-cash consideration of Rs 140 bn. During the last few years, the Company has monetised its investments in several asset-heavy businesses and JVs. It sold loss-making (loss of Rs 1 bn) general insurance business, sold stakes in IT and tech services by IPO. Further, the Company is in the final stage to sell its Kattupalli port.Outlook & valuation: We are positive on L&T led by strong execution in core E&C business with robust order inflow momentum led by strong performance of key segments i.e. Infrastructure and Hydrocarbon. The plan to exit part of development assets especially monetisation of Hyderabad metro in a long-term is positive, in our view. We expect its revenue and earnings to clock 13 per cent and 16 per cent CAGR, respectively over FY18-21E. At CMP, the stock trades at 19.9xFY20E and 17.1xFY21E earnings. We initiate coverage on the stock with BUY recommendation and an SOTP-based Target Price of Rs 1,760.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-larsen-toubro-target-rs-1760-reliance-securities/articleshow/66878406.cms

2018-12-01,"German football league Bundesliga has signed a long-term partnership with IMG Reliance that will see the Bundesliga and its clubs work towards the growth of Indian football through a series of activities in collaboration with multiple Indian stakeholders.The partnership will conduct a host of football development projects throughout the year, including leveraging Germany’s youth development system to launch grassroots activities in multiple states with the vision of elevating Indian football.“Both the Bundesliga and IMG Reliance will work in conjunction to conceptualise and execute a joint long-term strategy across all levels throughout India,” said Robert Klein, chief executive officer of Bundesliga International.While Bundesliga’s popularity in India has seen a rise over the years, the league will create deeper engagement with Indian consumers by organising visits from German football legends and current football stars, exhibition matches against German teams, match screenings, and fan parks, so as to provide fans in India with unique opportunities to experience the Bundesliga.The Bundesliga will also work towards extending Indo-German cooperation in the field of football by creating platforms and opportunities for Bundesliga clubs to explore technical and commercial partnerships in India.All its activities will be promoted by IMG Reliance.“It is an exciting opportunity for us to work with a football league that has a long-term vision for what it wants to achieve and has the strength of conviction to back this desire with the required investments,” said Srinivvaasan Gopalkrishnan of IMG Reliance.The Bundesliga is ranked second highest earning football league globally with annual revenues in excess of $4.5 billion, and has the highest average stadium attendance worldwide at 44,000 footfalls per game. The top clubs are Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund while key players in the league include Robert Lewandowski, Manuel Neuer, Marco Reus and James Rodriguez.Short Q&A with Robert Klein, CEO, BundesligaHow big an opportunity is India for the Bundesliga?Over the last five years, football has grown considerably in India, which was particularly evident during 2017’s FIFA Under-17 World Cup. The Indian Super League has played a big role in reigniting interest in football in India and developing new markets for the sport such as Chennai, Kochi, Bengaluru, Guwahati, Kolkata and Goa. India certainly presents a fascinating opportunity for the Bundesliga and our clubs. Considering the sheer size of the market, and the growing interest in football, this is the perfect time to focus on India.How do you plan to popularise Bundesliga in India?Football is global and the Bundesliga is a global brand. We believe, in order to grow the Bundesliga brand successfully, we need to have a clear strategic focus on India. In order to do this, we have developed a multi-faceted approach, which includes both digital and traditional marketing campaigns as well as on-ground activation in India.We also believe there are great opportunities for Bundesliga and Indian Super League clubs to help Indian football grow. Whilst they can help reach local supporters, we can offer our professional experience, particularly around youth development, spectator experience and fan engagement — aspects that the Bundesliga is famous for.What kind of investments have you planned in India in the near or long term?In order to strengthen our brand, we will be ensuring that our team spends the time necessary on developing and monitoring our strategy, given the complex cultural landscape that exists within India. For us, the sheer size of India and its population means that a short-term approach would be ineffective. A long-term, executable strategy is the only way to deeply connect with Indian audiences and help grow the sport across the country.From a commercial perspective, we will be actively seeking Indian business partners that share our vision for the development of football in the country. Creating connections between the business community and our clubs will be key to boosting activities and driving our consumer engagement strategy by capitalising on their market knowledge and contact with local communities.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/bundesliga-ties-up-with-img-reliance-to-help-develop-indian-football/articleshow/66891998.cms
2018-12-03,"I have invested in Reliance Tax Saver Fund. After three years, they told me I can can withdraw the full amount only after six years. Is this correct?--Raju KumarRaghvendra Nath, managing director, Ladderup Wealth Management, responds:Reliance Tax Saver Fund is an ELSS scheme which comes with a minimum lock-in period of three years. If you have made a lumpsum investment in ELSS, you can withdraw the full amount at the end of three years. But if you have invested through SIP, the units purchased through your 1st SIP investment can be withdrawn at the end of three years and the units purchased through your last SIP can only be withdrawn after three years of your last investment. For example, units purchased on 1st January 2018, can be redeemed on or after 1st January 2021. And units purchased on 1st February 2018 can only be redeemed on or after 1st February 2021. Similarly investment on 1st January 2021 can be withdrawn after 1st January 2024. Hence you can only withdraw full amount post after six years of investment initiation of the three-year SIP. You may start the withdrawal based on the units purchased, but the full withdrawal is only possible after six years.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/can-i-withdraw-money-in-reliance-tax-saver-only-after-six-years/articleshow/66915238.cms

2018-12-03,"NEW DELHI: The navy has encashed bank guarantees of debt-ridden Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited (RNEL) after the company overshot the deadline by four years for the naval offshore patrol vessels project. This was announced on Monday by Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba, who was responding to queries on whether action has been taken against the Anil Ambani-promoted company.“As far as RNEL is concerned, there is no preferential treatment being given to them. His bank guarantees have been encashed by the Navy. Punitive action has been taken against RNEL. The process is moving forward,” said Admiral Lanba. Sources told ETthat bank guarantees worth over Rs 100 crore were encashed earlier this year.Admiral Lanba, who was interacting with the media ahead of the Navy Day, said the company is facing legal trouble. “RNEL is undergoing corporate debt restructuring. They have been taken to court by their banker, IDBI,” he said.The navy chief, however, said the contract for naval offshore patrol vessels (NOPVs) — worth over .`2,500 crore — is not being cancelled. “The contract is being examined,” he said.The contract for NOPVs, awarded in 2011, has seen several delays over the years and is currently running four years behind schedule. In July 2017, RNEL had launched the first two patrol vessels at its shipyard in Pipavav, Gujarat. The two vessels are part of the five ships being constructed under the P-21project by RNEL.Sources said the debt-ridden company has written to the navy, promising delivery of the first vessel by the middle of next year.On the question of RNEL still being in consideration for the Rs 20,000-crore landing platform docks (LPDs) project, for which commercial proposals are still to be opened, the navy chief said the matter is still pending.When contacted by ET, RNEL refused to comment on the navy chief ’s remarks.The naval offshore patrol vessels would help in surveillance of India’s exclusive economic zone and other tasks such as anti-piracy patrols, coastal security and protection of shipping lanes.The navy chief said private sector ship-building capacity should be harnessed and taken forward under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. He shared that two-thirds of the navy’s modernisation budget has been spent on indigenous procurement during the past four financial years. “Thirty-two ships and submarines are presently under construction in Indian shipyards. These include the aircraft carrier Vikrant, P-15B class destroyers, P17A class stealth frigates, P28 ASW corvettes, offshore patrol vessels and Scorpene class submarines. In addition, the government has granted approval for 56 ships and six submarines,” he said.Admiral Lanba said India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier, also known as IAC-1or Vikrant, is in its third and final phase of construction at Kochi. “The sea trials are expected to commence mid-2020,” he said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/punitive-action-against-reliance-firm-navy-encashes-bank-guarantee-in-vessel-deal/articleshow/66923849.cms

2018-12-06,"We like some stocks in fast moving electrical goods category and also some stocks in the paint space which have been helped by the falling crude prices,     Devang Mehta, Head- Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:What is the call on ancillaries and defence-oriented engineering businesses? Bharat Forge is a case in point. Yesterday it was quite a rough day for the stock.A lot of frontline ancillary companies in India are more or less dependent on global trends. Tata Motors, especially JLR, has seen very contradictory sets of numbers across Europe, China or even US. Any company that is export oriented in terms of sales of automobile and auto components, should not be bought at this point. On the other hand, while consumption demand in terms of auto sales in India may have slowed down temporarily, but in the next year or so, some ancillaries supplying to two-wheelers or four-wheelers in India may bounce back on renewed domestic demand. But that will not include Bharat Forge which has a lot of global dependence. What is your view on the Glaxo Consumer-HUL deal?This is one deal where the synergies would help HUL to get into the type of market where they are not present. But the valuations are not at all supportive. On a trailing basis, you talk about valuations in excess of 65-70 times and on a one-year forward also you talk about anywhere around say 58-60 times! It is a deal which will help both the companies to create long-term wealth for shareholders. It will go through a lot of regulatory hurdles, in terms of how the deals shapes up and for the next one year at least would be on radar. If there is a correction and the valuation turns very attractive and the volume growth also improves, it would be a buy, otherwise not. What are your top three midcap names you will consider value buys in this market?We feel that value can probably emerge after some time but more so, we have been chasing growth and this would be a popular trade in the market. We are more present in market leaders in large, mid and even some smallcaps. We like certain stocks like Havells, but again not recommending it. We have it in all of our portfolios. There are some stocks like Havells which are continuously growing and do not see much contraction even in the bad phase of the market or the economy. The margins suffer a bit but this is clearly a fast moving electrical goods category which has come out of its own in terms of branding and pricing power. There’s Havells. Something in the paint space. If crude stays somewhere around $65-70, there would be a lot of impact on companies like even Kansai Nerolac, Berger Paints. This is another category which can show phenomenal growth in the next couple of years on the back of good demand.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-industries-could-be-the-flag-bearer-of-the-new-rally-devang-mehta-centrum-wealth-management/articleshow/66965724.cms
2018-12-06,"Reliance Industries, which witnessed a robust growth in earnings from its petrochemical business, is unlikely to see further improvement in profitability from the business, presenting a downside risk to consensus earnings, brokerage UBS said in a note Thursday.The brokerage reiterated its ‘sell’ rating on the shares, with a one-year price target of Rs 1,070 a share, which is almost 5% lower than its close of Rs 1,123.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday.Reliance Industries’ petrochemicals earnings in the first half of 2018-19 expanded largely due to stronger polyester chain.“RIL has expanded its petrochemical EBIT in H1FY19 to Rs 160 billion driven by higher polyester chain margins, capacity expansion and feed stock diversification in polymers to ethane. However, in last few weeks polyester chain spreads have faded despite weakness in naphtha prices,” UBS said.The brokerage said that demand for polyester from China is expected to slow down. But polymers, despite 20% decline in India polyethylene (PE) prices, spreads over naphtha have started to recover due to decline in naphtha prices.“RIL the feed stock diversification to ethane would keep them away from these benefits as almost half of RIL's PE output now uses ethane as feedstock. We believe that RIL's petchem profitability is unlikely to improve further quarter-on-quarter as consensus expects, presenting a downside risk to consensus earnings.

2018-12-10,"Irdai’s proposals on linked and non-linked life insurance product structures will allow more flexibility, besides reviving the pension space, Ashish Vohra ED and CEO, Reliance Nippon Life Insurance tells ET Wealth.How will the proposed changes in the structure of life insurance products affect policyholders?The proposals, if implemented, could make the till-now rigid life insurance product design space a lot more flexible. For one, policyholders will not be tied to one insurer while buying annuities. This way we could see a revival in the pension space. Surrender rules in case of non-linked policies, too, would be eased—the policies could then acquire surrender value after two years instead of the current three years. The changes would be in favour of customers.Won’t reducing minimum death benefit from 10 times the annual premium to seven be a step backwards, given that protection is the core of the life insurance business?The current rules for minimum cover are cumbersome and restrictive for product innovation. The proposed regulations have simplified the rules to provide more scope for offering flexible protection benefits to the customers such as ‘whole life’ flexible protection plans. They can start with low or medium protection covers when they are single and increase it when they start a family. They can also reduce it when they are closer to retirement to increase the savings component in the product. In addition, seven times is the minimum cover limit, companies are free to offer higher cover multiples.Won’t it put tax benefits out of the reach of policyholders?The minimum cover required to avail of tax-free status for maturity proceeds under Section 10 (10D) will be brought down to seven times. Past experience shows that tax benefits usually get aligned to the minimum cover prescribed by the regulator.What is your current product mix?Ulip sales have gone up after the imposition of long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on equity investments. Ulips now account for 30% of our portfolio, while traditional plans make up the balance.Insurers often contend that Ulips allow individuals to switch in and out of debt and equity without attracting tax, but how often do policyholders use the switch funds option?Consumers do find the switch option attractive when buying a Ulip policy, however the percentage of consumers who use the feature is limited. For instance, in our case, the percentage of Ulip customers who switch or opt for top-up is less than 1%of our in-force Ulip customer base.Do you intend to focus more on the protection side, like your peers?Given the shift in the industry towards a higher protection share, we are also shifting focus towards increased protection. We are in the process of launching a digital term insurance cover, which assures protection at economical cost to a large segment. Last year, we introduced several riders. Now, around two-third of our policies sold see at least one rider being attached to them. We are moving towards long-term products for increasing the protection coverage through longer tenure. We expect to have 75% of our business in policies with tenures longer than 10 years.What are your plans for the critical illness product segment?We have just launched a cancer protection plan—Cancer Protection Plus. Our product comes with a key differential—we pay out 100% of the sum insured, irrespective of whether it is early or late stage cancer. We intend to serve tier 2, tier 3 and tier 4 towns, areas that other insurers often do not target.From a customers’ perspective, what are the advantages of such plans over critical illness and disease-specific covers offered by health insurers?Products offered by life companies are fixed benefit plans and have the advantage of longer coverage term—five to 25 years as against health insurance plans which are shorter term. In most cases it also brings the advantage of guaranteed premiums for a minimum of five years.How do you plan to boost your persistency ratio?In the past two years. our 13-month persistency ratio has moved from the late 50s to the mid 70s, with institutional changes in customer acquisition and engagement process. Our current 13th month persistency ratio is at 75.7% for the half-year ended September 2018, up from 69.3% last year. There has been a 6% jump across 13th, 25th and 37th month persistency ratios.Why is the fifth-year persistency ratio still poor for the industry?Our fifth year persistency is at 43.6% for the half-year ended September 2018, and we expect this to move closer to the Asian average of 55-60% in the coming quarters. The biggest lever for improving the fifthyear persistency is to control the quality of first-year sales. Statistically, if the 13th month persistency is not good, no matter what you do, the later years will not put up a good show either. We have taken several steps to improve our first-year persistency. In addition, we are also improving our collection efforts. We have ramped up efforts to get people to pay their renewal premiums. For our better-originated book to hit the desired persistency level, it will take two more years.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/irdai-proposals-on-life-covers-will-help-buyers-ashish-vohra-reliance-nippon-life-insurance/articleshow/66996669.cms
2018-12-10,"New Delhi: Fourth-generation (4G) mobile broadband services could face stiff challenges once 5G deployments happen, as traditional pricing models will undergo a complete overhaul and voice and data services will no longer be billed on a “per-minute” or “per-bit-per-second” basis, a top executive at Reliance Jio Infocomm said. The Reliance Industries unit, India’s youngest telecom company, is keen to rapidly roll out the ultra-fast wireless broadband services.“Once 5G digital services arrive, business will be based on the actual value that the telcos offer a consumer in terms of digital solutions, content, and services,” Mathew Oommen, president of Jio, told ET.Second-generation services had made way for 3G and now “4G will be challenged by the imminent wave of 5G services that will no longer be charged based on minutes, bits or bytes anymore”, he said. Instead, he said, telcos would move to a new pricing mechanism, wherein they would look to measure “overall revenue per subscriber” for a combination of digital services.The newcomer, which disrupted market a little over two years ago and hastened sector consolidation, believes it is high time for telcos to “either disrupt the marketplace or face disruption”.Jio has evinced its keenness to roll out 5G services soonest and further disrupt the industry, which continues to reel under financial stress amid continuing price wars. Chairman Mukesh Ambani recently said India would be ready to ring in 5G services by 2020.The government has said the 5G spectrum will be allocated by the second half of 2019. Among local telcos, Jio is the only one seeking an early auction of 5G airwaves. Bharti Airtel and market leader Vodafone Idea want it pushed back to late-2019 and 2020, respectively.Oommen, a former technology chief at US-based Sprint Corp, said telecommunications is an industry that represented “continual transformation”.“For decades, telecom companies profited heavily as prices remained inflated due to the cost of building new networks,” he said.Oommen believes “normalcy would soon get restored” in the bruised sector once telcos catch up with technological evolution, as “increased usage would drive compensation from newer services”.“For decades, telecom companies profited heavily as prices remained inflated due to the cost of building new networks,” he said.The telecom sector has bore the brunt of intense competition unleashed by Jio’s entry in September 2016, which has resulted in an erosion of revenue and earnings for companies. It has also triggered a rapid consolidation in the sector, which now has only three dominant non-state telcos.Analysts at ratings firm ICRA recently said a recovery that was anticipated on the back of a consolidated telecom industry structure and higher data usage with greater price-inelasticity had been prolonged as intense competition was likely to persist, as telcos continued to strive for higher customer market and revenue share.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/5g-wave-to-pose-potential-challenge-to-4g-reliance-jios-mathew-oommen/articleshow/67018522.cms

2018-12-11,"Mumbai: Reliance Communications (RCom) has filed a contempt of court petition in the Supreme Court against the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for not clearing its spectrum sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) within the stipulated period, thereby intensifying the battle between the operator and the government.The Anil Ambani-owned company was prompted to file a contempt case after the DoT “did not follow the apex court’s direction and grant them the approval for spectrum sale within seven days of receiving corporate guarantees”, said a person familiar with the matter.RCom didn’t respond to ET’s email till press-time. The company has been locked in a legal battle over DoT’s demand for spectrum-related dues worth Rs 2,947.68 crore for many months.Shares of RCom closed at Rs 14.72, down 6.06% on the BSE on Monday.The Supreme Court on November 30 had allowed the telco to sell its spectrum to Jio, but asked it to furnish a corporate guarantee of Rs 1,400 crore to DoT. It had further directed the DoT to approve the spectrum deal within seven days of receiving the corporate guarantee. On December 3, RCom stated that it had submitted the corporate guarantee.The spectrum sale is part of a larger Rs 18,000-crore asset monetisation exercise by RCom involving the sale of switching nodes, fibre, telecom towers and spectrum to Jio, and real estate to Canada’s Brookfield. The nodes and fibre have been sold for Rs 5,000 crore.For Rcom, which is weighed down by a debt of Rs 46,000 crore, it is crucial that the rest of the asset sale goes through at the earliest to be able to repay its 39 financial lenders. It also wants to use part of the proceeds to pay a combined Rs 975 crore to Ericsson (Rs 550 crore plus interest), an operational creditor, and HSBC Daisy Investments and others, minority shareholders in Reliance Infratel, by December, a deadline also mandated by the apex court. Failing which, RCom could well get dragged into insolvency proceedings.DoT officials insisted that they can give their approval only when the due diligence on the corporate guarantee has been completed.“The approval will happen very soon, but we need to do our checks on the corporate guarantee before agreeing to anything,” said a DoT official, who did not want to be named.RCom’s unit, Reliance Realty, had furnished the Rs 1,400-crore corporate guarantee.The telco, which closed its wireless business in late 2017, has been weighed down by its debt, declining revenue and widening losses.RCom’s wireless assets that will go to Jio include 122.4 units of 4G airwaves across the 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands and over 43,000 telecom towers housed under Reliance Infratel.The apex court had upheld an earlier verdict of the telecom tribunal in October that no bank guarantee was needed for DoT to approve the RCom-Jio spectrum deal. The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) had instead asked RCom to pledge land worth Rs 1,400 crore to cover for DoT’s dues, which the government had challenged.In a separate hearing in SC on Monday, the apex court sent a notice to the telecom regulator seeking a response on an appeal filed earlier by RCom. The telco had challenged an earlier order of TDSAT directing the operator to refund their prepaid customers who had unspent balances but had to discontinue or port out when RCom stopped its service .",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-communications-files-contempt-of-court-plea-against-dot/articleshow/67035091.cms

2018-12-11,"MUMBAI: The Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) board has cleared hiving off the telco’s tower and fibre assets into two separate units, a move that will make it easier for the mobile phone company to monetise them in future as it competes with rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India in a capital intensive industry.“The Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held today, accorded its approval to: (i) a scheme of arrangement for transfer of its fibre undertaking, on a going concern basis, to a separate company (ii) a scheme of arrangement for transfer of its tower undertaking, on a going concern basis, to a separate company,” Jio said in a notice to stock exchanges on Tuesday.The decisions will need to go through necessary regulatory approvals, the Mukesh Ambani-owned operator added.The new entrant has over three lakh route kilometers of fiber, and uses about 2.2 lakh towers – including over a 100,000 of its own towers and those from Reliance Communications (RCom) and other third party tower companies - for its operations, according to people familiar with the matter. But as of now, only Jio’s own towers will be transferred into the new unit. The people added that RCom’s fibre and towers will also be a part of the new units eventually. RCom has already sold its 1,78,000 route kilometres (route km) of fibre assets to Jio and is set to also sell its 43,000 towers to the new telecom entrant.According to analysts, this move will help Jio in multiple ways. “By hiving off into units, it will make the operating company asset light, increase its ability to leverage and open up the units for monetisation,” said a senior industry executive, who did not want to be named. Another analyst added that the monetisation opportunities could include leasing out the assets to other companies and even selling stakes in the units.Jio, along with Bharti Airtel – and Vodafone Idea to a lesser extent – has been investing top dollars into expanding their 4G infrastructure amidst an intense fight for market share.The executive added that going ahead, the move will also increase Jio’s profitability.The latest entrant, which started commercial operations just over two years back, has already racked up over 252 million users, and has been rapidly closing in on market leader Vodafone Idea and second ranked Bharti Airtel in terms of subscriber base and revenue market share.Jio, which is the only telco posting profits compared to losses for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s India operations, is in fact following the example of its two rivals in hiving off these two assets into separate units. Recently, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea hived off their fibre assets – 246,000 route kms and 156,000 route kms respectively – into separate units. While Vodafone Idea, in desperate need for cash, plans to monetize the fibre assets, Airtel is looking to form an independent fibre company and could also monetize its holdings in the unit at a later stage.Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea also jointly own tower company Indus Towers – with over 123,000 towers. Indus is in the process of merging with Bharti Infratel, India’s only listed telecom tower company which owns over 39,000 towers on its own. Airtel holds its stake in Indus through Bharti Infratel, its unit.Airtel has also been selling parts of its stake in Infratel to raise funds to be competitive against Jio, while Vodafone Idea is also expected to monetize a part of its stake in the merged entity created through the Indus-Infratel merger.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-to-hive-off-fibre-towers-into-separate-units/articleshow/67047737.cms

2018-12-13,"KOLKATA: Mukesh Ambani has an ambitious plan to utilise it’s over 5,100-plus smaller Jio Point stores in more than 5,000 cities and towns as the last mile connection point for its e-commerce venture to reach consumers without internet access or who have never shopped online, two senior executives said.Reliance Retail will undertake assisted sales of sugar, pulses, soaps and biscuits to apparel and shoes from the Jio Point stores to be delivered to door steps using the existing Jio distribution network which already reaches these stores to supply simcards, mobile handsets and accessories.The company would set up e-commerce kiosks in Jio Point stores from where store executives will help consumers place orders. “Potentially, they can sell anything using this network which has a shelf life and doesn’t require installation service. The customer can pick up the product from the Jio Point or store executives can deliver to them,” an executive said.Reliance Retail is already undertaking similar sales for televisions, refrigerators and washing machines from Jio Point stores that account for 10% of its overall consumer electronics sales. It now plans to extend the same model to grocery, personal care, apparel and shoes, the executives said.“The Jio Points will play a critical role for extending reach of Reliance Retail’s ecommerce venture. This is likely to take off by April next year,” said one of the executives.Another executive said Reliance Retail wants to reach out to 95% of India’s population directly which will only be possible through e-commerce and the Jio Point stores.“The company wants to have a retail presence through e-commerce in towns with population over 10,000, which would mean a presence across 95-98% of India’s consumer base,” he said.An email sent to Reliance Retail remained unanswered till Wednesday press time.Reliance has plans to open 50,000 Jio Point stores in neighbourhood locations in big cities and in smaller towns and rural India which will operate as customer sales and service touch points for Reliance Jio and create distribution network in the catchment area. The company adds over 500 new Jio Points every quarter.Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart too is trying to increase online shopping penetration in rural towns and smaller cities with multiple initiatives. Amazon, for instance, runs Project Udaan, where it has reached out to more than 12,000 mom-andpop stores and local entrepreneurs in small towns from where consumers can place orders and take the product.According EY India’s latest report, the rural market for e-commerce in India is likely to be a $10-12 billion opportunity in the next four years.This is attributed to rising household income leading to an increase in consumption expenditure, diversified income sources from non-agricultural activities, positive agricultural outlook, increase in internet penetration, high propensity to spend and rising number of nuclear families in rural India, the report said. It estimates total e-commerce sales in India are likely to grow at 32% CAGR from 2017 to 2021.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-may-use-5k-jio-points-for-e-comm-connect/articleshow/67069324.cms

2018-12-14,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty managed to finish Friday's session with mild gains after a seesaw session as speculations about the RBI board meet outcome kept investors at bay.Weak global cues also weighed on sentiment. Global stocks suffered losses on concerns of China's slowing economic growth after data showed China’s November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003.

2018-12-15,"Reliance Jio Infocomm is in talks with US contract manufacturer Flex for locally producing about 100 million mobile phone handsets as the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco seeks to rapidly enhance its market share by signing on the majority of those users now using feature phones. “Jio is in advanced discussions for a large order and that has caused a stir in the market, even prompting Flex to negotiate some tax benefits with the government in the SEZ where its factory is located,” a person familiar with matter told ET.Both Flex and Jio didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.Another person said that Flex currently has the capacity to manufacture around 4-5 million devices per month at its factory in the special economic zone (SEZ) near Chennai. “However, the company wants to be able to sell the produced units in the domestic tariff area (DTAs), without attracting the duties, at rates similar to that of FTAs,” the person said.Telco Must Bear Maintenance CostsAny move by the government to allow selling goods produced in the SEZ in DTAs without attracting duties would allow the handsets to be priced affordably, making it attractive for the first-time smartphone buyers, said experts.It is only natural that Jio is targeting the next low-hanging fruit, the bulk of India’s 500 million featurephone users who would switch to smartphones if the bundled price points for the service and handsets were attractive.Jio’s objective of rapidly gaining market share is clear from the size of the imminent order. Data from Counterpoint Research showed that 118 million and 134 million smartphones were sold in 2016 and 2017, respectively, in India. The agency expects the number to be around 150 million in 2018.An ICICI Securities report on the telecom regulator’s data showed that Vodafone Idea was leading the pack, with a revenue market share of 32.8%, followed by Bharti Airtel at 30.9%, and Reliance Jio at 26.1%.But Jio was making rapid gains, compared with losses of its rivals, due to largely expanding market share in the rural areas and tier-3 towns after the launch of its 4G VoLTE featurephone — JioPhone. Jio’s recent Monsoon Hungama offer of exchanging any old featurephone for a JioPhone for around Rs 1,000 (including six months recharge) has also proven to be a hit, with users of plainvanilla phones upgrading to 4G and contributing to the upsurge in Jio’s subscriber base at over 252 million by end-September. By contrast, Vodafone India and Bharti Airtel reported declines.PHONE SUBSIDY MODELA report by research firm Bernstien said that Jio’s phone subsidy model could help it lead the market in the future, especially if its rivals failed to match up. “If left unchallenged, we believe Jio could reach the leading revenue market share by 2021 and by subscribers by 2022. We now expect Jio to reach 28% revenue market share and 26% subscriber market share by the end of this financial year,” the report said.Navkender Singh, associate research director at market tracker IDC, said Jio is currently in a sweet spot, and could target the top end of featurephone users to convert them into the Rs 2,000-Rs 2,500 smartphone-user segment.“With its deep pockets, Jio is the best placed to seize the opportunity to upgrade at least the top 60% of the featurephone users,” Singh said, cautioning that the telco must bundle attractive plans.“To pull this off successfully, Jio will have to take care of the maintenance of the phone along with, may be, 1GB of data a day,” Singh said. He explained that one of the concerns deterring featurephone users from switching was the scare of easily broken screens, which could cost up to half of a new smartphone. “There is no point in buying a phone at Rs 2,000 if a broken screen would require a Rs 1,000 charge. So, Jio will have to absorb this cost if it wants customers to buy in,” Singh said.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-jio-in-talks-with-us-handset-company-flex-for-smartphone-production/articleshow/67101003.cms

2018-12-17,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Sonata Software with a target price of Rs 420.The current market price of Sonata Software is Rs 317.45.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Sonata Software price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerageGold certified MS Dynamics Provider to strengthen MS Technology focus: Sopris Systems is a gold-certified MS Dynamics solution provider specialising in ERP and CRM software for engineering & construction firms, field services companies (such as communications) and professional service firms. Thus, the deal gives Sonata an opportunity to further drive its MS Dynamics 365 business and also expand its vertical focus beyond Retail, Travel and ISV. Sonata will also be able to sell its “Platformation” solutions to Sopris’ clients. The acquisition – following the acquisition of Australia-based Scalable Data Systems (SDS) last week – will further strengthen Sonata’s MS Dynamics footprint in the US and expand its Dynamics 365 capabilities, further reflecting its intent to strategically focus on MS technologies, mainly Dynamics 365.Deal at 1x EV/revenue to add 3.5-4 per cent to FY20E IITS revenue: Sonata has bought Sopris for a deal EV of US$7mn (Rs50.3 crore), with an implied EV/Rev multiple of 1x (annual revenue of US$7mn/Rs 50.3 crore). The deal will be funded through Sonata’s internal accruals (&gt;Rs 300 crore cash and investments as of 2QFY19-end). The acquisition should conclude within a month and consolidation is likely to take place with effect from 4QFY19E. From a financial perspective, the acquisition will add nearly 3.5-4 per cent to Sonata’s FY20E IITS revenue. Thus, including acquisition of SDS last week, there will be nearly 5.5-6 per cent accretion to Sonata’s FY20E IITS revenue. Sonata has spent nearly Rs 78.5 crore on these 2 acquisitions, implying &gt;25 per cent of its cash and investments as of 2QFY19-end. We are enthused with Sonata’s intent to effectively utilise its cash reserves to buy out select companies for building scale in MS Dynamics, and to strategically grow the important Microsoft account and ecosystem.Outlook & valuation: We like Sonata’s differentiated business, IP-led focus, quality balance sheet, high RoE and dividend yield, apart from no equity dilution over the past 17 years. Given Sonata’s platform focus, IP and S&M investments, strong cash generation, reasonable valuation (12.3x FY20E EPS) post the nearly 20 per cent stock decline over the past 3 months, along with a healthy 19 per cent EPS CAGR over FY18-FY20E, we believe there exists good legroom for stock upside. We retain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a Target Price of Rs 420.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-sonata-software-target-rs-420-reliance-securities/articleshow/67125549.cms
2018-12-17,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Persistent Systems with a target price of Rs 760.The current market price of Persistent Systems is Rs 607.80.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Persistent Systems price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerageAppointment of new MD – a key stock trigger: Management highlighted an important development i.e. appointment of a new MD, as Persistent will be required to separate the positions of Chairman & MD (both currently held by Dr. Anand Deshpande). New MD will be an external candidate with a high sales focus, which we believe is critical in view of frequent disappointments and volatility on earnings over the past few quarters, owing to which the stock trades at a fairly low PE multiple of 11.3x FY20E EPS.Improved business focus – positive sign: Persistent’s broader strategic focus is on software product development with major industry verticals including Healthcare and Life Sciences (LS), BFSI and Industrial & MFG. Its vision is to build a ‘software-driven organisation’ with a broader objective to drive results for clients through 4 initiatives - Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML), Cloud, Security and Internet of Things (IoT). For building expertise, the partnership route is preferred - in Healthcare, Persistent has partnered with Partners Healthcare, a not-for-profit patient care entity, while in BFSI, it has partnered with Mambu, a cloud-native core banking solution provider.Healthcare & life sciences - focus on digital healthcare: Healthcare & LS is a US$3trln industry in the US. Persistent is focusing on digital healthcare with a focus on Analytics, AI and Intelligence, giving actionable insights to clients from Big Data. Salesforce is Persistent’s core platform partner. It has formed a CoE with Partners Healthcare in the areas of preventive and chronic healthcare. Persistent is developing a healthcare platform with Partners for clinical research. The revenue model is licence-cum-services (80-90 per cent services) with revenue shared with Partners for licence, while 100 per cent of services revenue will come to Persistent. In Sept’18, Persistent acquired Herald Health, a company that has developed IP in providing user-friendly tools. This is another step to go in line with its Healthcare strategy to drive analytics, AI and Intelligence to drive improved client focus.BFSI – digitally native: In BFSI, Persistent enables clients to build digital products and automate banking operations. One of the IT firm’s clients, ANZ gave a perspective on the work Persistent has done in Trade Finance, essentially digitising data of multiple forms containing the same data from different authorities. Other businesses like retail banking and lending are also looking at driving digital disruption. Persistent has partnered with Mambu, a cloud-native core banking solution provider.Outlook & valuation: We are enthused with a renewed focus on specific growth areas and verticals, and appointment of new MD, which could be a key stock driver. We understand quarterly fluctuations are inherent in an IP-based business like this. However, we would prefer to see improvement in revenue predictability, which has not been the case over the past few quarters. Valuation at 11.3x FY20E EPS is one of the lowest in the industry. We maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a Target Price of Rs760.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-persistent-systems-target-rs-760-reliance-securities/articleshow/67125907.cms

2018-12-18,"World's largest oil exporter Saudi Arabia and richest Indian Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries are discussing joint investment in petrochemicals and refinery projects, the Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said.Al-Falih, who has known Ambani for over a decade now, travelled to Udaipur earlier this month to attend the pre-wedding festivities of Ambani's daughter Isha's marriage with Ajay Piramal's son Anand.During that visit, he also held talks with Ambani but choose to tweet about those discussions only this week.In an Arabic tweet, which was translated using online tools, Al-Falih said he was delighted to meet Ambani.At the meeting ""we discussed opportunities for joint investments and cooperation in petrochemical, refining and communications projects.""He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on December 8 and 9.No details of the meeting were available from Reliance.Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry sources said.Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world's fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces.Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co (ADNOC) have picked up 50 per cent stake in a planned USD 44-billion refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.Aramco and ADNOC will together hold 50 per cent stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) refinery and adjacent 18 MTPA petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025.The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery.Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world's third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas.India has a refining capacity of 247.6 million tonnes, which exceeded the demand of 206.2 million tonnes.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonnes by 2040.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/saudi-arabia-reliance-in-talks-for-refinery-petrochemical-project-saudi-oil-minister/articleshow/67142876.cms

2018-12-23,"Kolkata: Reliance Jio Infocomm subscribers could face disruptions in services in key markets such as Delhi, Maharashtra and West Bengal if the latest telecom entrant doesn’t manage to buy spectrum from Reliance Communications and the Anil Ambani-owned telco gets pushed into insolvency, sector experts and analysts said.This, they said, is since the Mukesh Ambani-led telco is dependent on RCom to create contiguous spectrum blocks of five units in the premium 800 MHz band — the bare minimum spectrum requirement for 4G LTE services — in the key markets, which also include Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In each of these circles, Jio holds 3.8 units of 4G airwaves in the 800 MHz band, and is dependent on RCom’s spectrum in the same band for uninterrupted LTE coverage.“It’s critical that the spectrum trading deal gets cleared soon as it will give Jio exclusive access to RCom’s 4G spectrum that will help it create contiguous blocks in the 800 MHz band, which is absolutely essential for LTE coverage to avoid service disruptions in key markets,” Rohan Dhamija, partner & head of India & Middle East at Analysys Mason, told ET.The spectrum trading agreement was inked in late 2017, which if cleared, would have seen RCom sell 122.4 units of 4G airwaves to Jio, including the 800 MHz band LTE spectrum that it acquired from Sistema Shyam Teleservices, which has a longer-validity period. The airwaves sale pact is central to RCom’s plans to cut its mammoth Rs 46,000 crore debt, by some Rs 18,000 crore, which would help the Anil Ambani-owned telco stave off insolvency proceedings.So, while the deal is critical for RCom, it’s also crucial to Jio, else the overall quality of its 4G LTE coverage could also suffer in other key markets like Mumbai, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Assam and Northeast. This is since without access to RCom’s airwaves in these circles, Jio’s standalone holdings in this 4G band would be virtually half the combined holdings of the two companies.“The overall quality of Jio’s LTE coverage is bound to decline in markets like Mumbai, Gujarat, MP and the eastern circles since halving of available 800 MHz spectrum will automatically reduce the network capacity,” said a senior industry executive, who did not wish to be named.Under the circumstances, Jio would have no option but to continue its 21-circle spectrum sharing pact with RCom to ensure unhindered 4G LTE coverage. RCom and Jio have airwaves sharing pacts across 21 circles, barring Jammu & Kashmir.That spectrum sharing arrangement could also face roadblocks, in the event the Anil Ambani-led telco gets mired in insolvency proceedings, experts noted. RCom is also sharing an additional 65-odd units of 800 Mhz LTE spectrum with Jio that it plans to sell to the 4G entrant for roughly Rs 3,700 crore and reduce its debt further.“If RCom gets dragged into insolvency proceedings, and even worse, goes into liquidation, all its spectrum assets would get taken over under the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, to be auctioned to pay off creditors, which is a complicated and long-drawn process,” said a senior industry executive who did not wish to be named.In such a scenario, Jio wouldn’t be able to share RCom's spectrum any more, including those in the 800 MHz band, he said. Experts also cited a government regulation that states that spectrum sharing can happen only between two licencees operating two independent networks in the same band. RCom has already shut its wireless services a year back.Jio has its own back up 4G spectrum in the 1800 and 2300 MHz bands in all the markets where it is currently operating LTE services on the 800 MHz band via sharing with RCom. However, a senior industry executive said the quality of Jio’s 4G coverage would automatically decline if it were to migrate its network to the less efficient 1800 MHz band, which would also require a sizeable additional deployment of towers and drive up costs.Also, such an airwaves migration exercise in the Jio network won’t be seamless, and is bound to cause service disruptions, as it would entail changes in network planning, he added. At press time, Reliance Jio and RCom did not reply to ET’s queries.Last week, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) refused to clear the RCom-Jio spectrum trading deal, saying it didn’t conform to government rules.DoT’s refusal has dealt a body blow to RCom’s efforts to pay off creditors and avoid insolvency proceedings.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-subscribers-may-face-disruption-if-reliance-communications-deal-fails/articleshow/67221519.cms

This, in a bid to target most of India’s 500 million feature phone users who would switch to smartphones if the effective price points for the service and handsets were attractive.“Wherever we feel there are gaps in the market which the people are not able to address or not able to take a risk about because they have their own priorities at times, those are the markets that we will then want to address,” Dutt said.The telco has been making rapid subscriber market share gains as compared with losses of its rivals owing to expansion in the rural areas and tier-3 towns on the back of its 4G VoLTE feature phone — JioPhone.“There are billions of people who are on devices which do not support good data experience or rich content experience, for them we introduced JioPhone to start experiencing more content services of Jio like television, cinema, music, even YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp,” said Dutt.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/reliance-jio-plans-to-launch-large-screen-smartphones/articleshow/67250558.cms

2018-12-28,"NEW DELHI: India’s mobile phone companies must invest and innovate beyond traditional voice and data offerings, else they run the risk of being disrupted by aggressive rivals or app makers, a top executive at Reliance Jio said.“For service providers, just voice or even traditional data revenue alone is not going to be the cure. They have to invest and innovate so that they would not get displaced by other aggressive providers or more importantly by OTT companies,” Jio president Mathew Oommen told ET.India’s older players Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India have been blamed by some for not having invested enough in infrastructure and innovation in the lead up to Jio’s entry in 2016, which has allowed them to be disrupted to such an extent that both are in the red, having seen the revenue plummet amid a brutal price war. The incumbents have also been blamed for not keeping pace with times, allowing over-the-top (OTT) players such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Skype to eat into their traditional voice and SMS revenue over the last few years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea – created after the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular – have previously rejected the views. “This is just the start of the telco disruption and accelerated consumer mobile broadband and digital adoption,” Oommen said, adding that if services like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and HD video content are provided at affordable rates, people would consume, and telcos could face more disruption.Taking a different track to incumbent telcos, Jio has urged the telecom department to hold early auctions for 4G and 5G airwaves.“Fifth-generation (5G) technology is a huge benefit to operators who have already invested significantly in 4G, he said, adding that operators in India were still building out their 4G networks and just launching Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) based voice network.Jio Cinema Joins Hands with DisneyMumbai: Jio Cinema, a digital app of Reliance Jio, has tied up with Disney to provide a dedicated section on Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucas films to its over 250 million subscribers. “...the app will host a dedicated Disney-branded section on the homepage with content spanning across movies, animation, series and shorts,” the firm said.
